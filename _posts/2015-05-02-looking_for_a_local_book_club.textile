St Margarets' Book Club, meets every third Thursday of the month at the Turks Head. Our members are of all ages and backgrounds.

If you love books with a passion and like the idea of reading something you wouldn't normally go for (our choices are wide ranging but always a bit more than a holiday read) we would love you to join us.
