Business Secretary Vince Cable has launched the "Unistats website":http://unistats.direct.gov.uk/, which provides comparison information on over 31,000 universtiy and college courses in the UK.

Students will now be able to compare key data on what matters to them when choosing a course at university, including:

* Student satisfaction ratings
* Graduate salaries and employment
* Tuition fees and financial support
* The cost of accommodation

The site uses the new Key Information Set (KIS). This was compiled after consulting students about what information they found most useful when choosing courses. Each course's data links directly to the relevant university web page which gives more detail on course content and how it will be taught.

For the first time, prospective students will also be able to tailor their search by their personal preferences, specifying what is most important for them. They will also be able to create a shortlist of their favourite courses and produce a detailed comparison page, making it easier to compare different options.
