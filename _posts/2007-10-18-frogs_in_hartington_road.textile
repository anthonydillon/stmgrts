bq.. "I wonder if anyone could help here. We live at the school end of Hartington Road and our cats are wont to bring (usually live) frogs into the house. In the past I’ve carried them to the school, thinking that they’ve probably come from the pond there, but now that pond has gone and the frogs are still coming! Could anyone suggest where the best place is for us to repatriate these amphibians?

Many thanks."
