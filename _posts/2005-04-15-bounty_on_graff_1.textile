Graffiti (and vandalism) has been a growing problem in St Margarets and the surrounding area for the last few years -- just look at the state of the train station!.  To that end, the Richmond Council has announced a reward for information that leads to the _conviction_ of a graffiti vandal of up to £1,000.

Call (0)20 8891 7050 if you have any information.  All information will be treated confidentially.  The Richmond Council website has "more information":http://www.richmond.gov.uk/depts/chiefexec/media/news/releases/Mar2005/9605.htm.

bq. We want the public to help us beat this plague, be our eyes and ears. If people have any information which could lead to the conviction of a graffiti vandal they should not hesitate to call us. If a conviction is secured we will pay out up to £1,000.

p>. -- _Cllr Tony Arbour_

p. Please help stop the defacement and disfigurement of our streets and public places!
