MP Vince Cable has demanded talks with Thames Water amid claims people living in St Margarets, Whitton and parts of Twickenham were not consulted over the expansion of Mogden sewage works.

The utilities giant's application to expand the Isleworth plant by almost half was given the green light by Hounslow Council's sustainable development committee on March 4.

But those living down wind of the infamous 'pong' say they did not have a chance to air their views before the meeting.
