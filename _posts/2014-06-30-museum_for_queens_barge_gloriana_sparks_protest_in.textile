_Residents are furious at Tory Lord True's plans to build boat a home in river park and claim council was 'acting in secret'_

As the lead vessel in the Queen's diamond jubilee river pageant, she glistened with gold, flew the flags of the United Kingdom, and epitomised the pomp and circumstance of the occasion.

The royal barge Gloriana, built in Richmond upon Thames especially for the jubilee and inspired by 18<sup>th</sup>-century barges painted by the Italian artist Canaletto, has been used in several ceremonies since her June 2012 debut, including the Olympics. But her next likely appearance - in an enormous dry dock in a new river park alongside the Thames in Twickenham - has led to an angry protest.

The idea is the brainchild of Lord True, the Conservative leader of Richmond council, and involves &pound;1m of public money to create a tourist and heritage site with Gloriana as its centre, as a tribute to the vessel, its Richmond connections, and to the Queen.
