Each year Twickenham comes to life with the sights and sounds of Carnival in a free summer celebration for the whole family. A riverside parade leads crowds to the Carnival village in the grounds of Orleans House Gallery in an explosion of music, dance and spectacular costume.

Celebrations then continue throughout the afternoon with a variety of live performance, games, arts activities, food from around the globe and workshops suitable for the whole family.



* 12.30pm - Parade leaves St Mary's Church, Twickenham

Carnival 2015 will celebrate 'team spirit' as we welcome the arrival of the Rugby World Cup to Twickenham later this year.

Join us for an afternoon of live Carnival music and dance, fused with sports games, arts-activities and workshops.
