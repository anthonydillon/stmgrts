<em>Are you a parent/grandparent?  Would you like to help local families?</em>

If you can spare a few hours a week to help families with children under 5, local charity Home-Start Richmond can train you to support those having a difficult time.

The free volunteer course runs from 14 January - 25 March 2015 on Wednesdays, 10am to 2.30pm, with an introduction on 7 January in the morning. Can be accredited NVQ level 1 or 2.
