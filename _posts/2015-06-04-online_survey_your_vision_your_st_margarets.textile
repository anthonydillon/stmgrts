London Borough of Richmond upon Thames would like residents, businesses, community groups and organisations to help with improving the St Margarets Village area. This will include helping to shape:

* How current Council policy impacts on planning and development and how best to protect and enhance your areas character and conservation areas
* Aspirations for your community that contribute to its character and feel to make it a desirable place to live such as strengthening opportunities to get involved or tackling isolation of the elderly

This is the first stage of consultation when we would like your views on your local area and community today and for the future. Your feedback will be used to create an updated Village Plan for St Margarets that will be published in the Autumn 2015.

The second formal stage of consultation will take place during September and October 2015 and will focus solely on the local planning guidance for St Margarets before it is adopted in late 2015.

* "Take the online survey by 29 June 2015":http://stmgrts.org.uk/l/th3vl
