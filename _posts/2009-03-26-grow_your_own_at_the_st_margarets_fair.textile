    As in previous years the serious planning for this year's Fair began in January.  Saturday the 11<sup>th</sup> of July is the date for the Fair, and as always Moormead recreation ground is the venue.  To mark the 30<sup>th</sup> Fair last year there were some changes, notably the improvements to the toilet facilities and the reduction in the prices for the fairground rides.  This year we're also moving the stage further away from the tea tent to help separate the 'rock' from the rolls.   The Committee have always viewed the Fair primarily as a community event and whilst any profit we make supports local charities and schools, our over riding objective is to continue to provide an enjoyable community day every July for the whole population of St Margarets.  This year we're considering an ambitious new attraction.  Whether you grow flowers, plants, vegetables or fruit, we thought you might like to exhibit your produce - and if you wanted to, enter it for judging.  If enough of you are interested then we'll see if we can organise it.
