Sorry if you've tried to contact us and we haven't responded since our last posting on this website, regarding the money we have reserved for local charities.  We've recently discovered that our email server had failed.  So that still leaves us with some money for our local charities.  As previously mentioned, this year we're going to give everybody in St Margarets the opportunity to put forward their suggestions for some worthy local causes that could benefit from a share of this money.  So if you are a local charity or just want to suggest an organisation for us to consider please contact us via our email address "info@stmargaretsfair.org":mailto:info@stmargaretsfair.org   Your email will get to us this time!
