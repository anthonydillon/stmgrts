Richmond Council has decided to increase what it charges "St Stephens C.E. Junior School":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/directory/school/200507170243 to use Moormead park from &pound;450 per term to &pound;1,600 per term  (down from an amazing original &pound;2,400 per term increase).

Currently the school is refusing to play.

A group of parents at St Stephens is organising a petition against the council's outrageous 356% increase.  The petition is outside the school's office and in the playground after school during pick-up time.
