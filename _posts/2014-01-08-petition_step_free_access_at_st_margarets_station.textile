Local resident Paul Nicoll has started a petition to Network Rail to request step free access at St Margarets Station.  The petition states:

bq. Given the number of local people with young children and buggies, we believe that the introduction of step free access at St Margarets railway station should now be seriously considered by Network Rail. You only have to spend a few minutes at the station to witness mums struggling down the many steps with their buggies. This is not only dangerous but essentially impossible without the help of passers-by. This issue is literally impacting hundreds of local people (as hopefully this petition will demonstrate).

_On reaching 1,000 signatures or more a full council debate will be held._
