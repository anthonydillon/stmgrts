    As you are probably aware, the "second stage questionnaire":http://www.richmond.gov.uk/home/transport_and_streets/motor_vehicles_roads_and_parking/parking/controlled_parking_zones/controlled_parking_zone_consultations/st_margarets_cpz_consultation.htm needs to be returned to the Richmond Council by Friday 23 May 2008 as do any comments or representations to the Transport Consultative Group.  However, we would like to take another informal poll on this site to see if anything has changed since "our poll in June 2006":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2007/06/cpz_poll_thoughts.html.
