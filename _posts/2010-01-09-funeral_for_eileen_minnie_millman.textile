Sadly, we have to announce the passing of Eileen 'Minnie' Millman a lady renowned, even famous for her kindness, warmth and support to many children (and their parents!) who attended Orleans Infant School.  She was a dinner lady and mid-day supervisor there for many years.

The funeral of this very popular lady, is at Mortlake rematorium on 14<sup>th</sup> January at 11am.  It would be wonderful if people could come along. She did not like cut flowers so instead donations are requested to "The Shooting Star Children's Hospice":http://www.shootingstar.org.uk/ in Hampton.
