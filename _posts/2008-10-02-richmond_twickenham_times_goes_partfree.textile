    Regional publisher Newsquest is to dump two existing free weekly newspapers and replace them by transforming its 135-year-old weekly paid-for title, the Richmond & Twickenham Times, into a paper with a mixed free and paid-for distribution.
    
    The free edition of the Times will be delivered door to door in Richmond & Twickenham from Friday, October 10, replacing the area's current free weekly the Richmond Guardian.
