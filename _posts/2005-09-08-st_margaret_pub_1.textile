The deadline has passed for comments; however, the date of the hearing hasn't been published.

bq.. Residents wishing to make an objection to the Application for  "Variation in Licensing arrangements" at St Margarets' Tavern have until September 14th [at York House]

Again all letters should be sent to Licensing Officers ("licensing@richmond.gov.uk":mailto:licensing@richmond.gov.uk at Parkshot.

I also would appreciate copy [of the comment] as it is helpful if at the last minute someone who intended to speak when the Application comes to Committee, is unable to do so.
