Well the excitement of the BAFTAs is now over, with Skyfall winning most outstanding film although its British director Sam Mendes bemoaned the fact that 007 himself, actor Daniel Craig didn't get a nomination. Javier Bardem worked equally hard at his brilliant portrayal of baddie Raoul Silva. Here at Dreamcatcher Media, the films made on our Easter and Summer Film Camps also feature great heroes and anti-heroes, goodies and baddies, exciting chases and dramatic scenes - all scripted, filmed and directed by young people aged 8 - 16.

Our next 5 day Film Camp starts during the Easter break on 8<sup>th</sup> April. Participants come up with their own idea for a film, then set about shooting, directing and editing it over the five days under expert tuition from industry professionals. It's all great fun but good learning too and young wannabee filmmakers finish the course equipped to make their own movies.

Sponsored by the Alpha Plus Group, the Camp takes place at Falcons Boys Prep School in Richmond and runs Monday to Friday 8<sup>th</sup>-13<sup>th</sup> April starting at 9am.
