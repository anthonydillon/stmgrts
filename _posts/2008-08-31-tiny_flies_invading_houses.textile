In late May/ June my house (north St Margarets) was invaded by large numbers of very small flies.

The creatures seemed to be short lived, usually to be found dead the next day.

The main area affected was the family room with doors and windows (open most of the time during the evening for ventilation and the dog) leading out to the garden.
 
I was told a simular story by a resident of East Twickenham.
 
Have any other local residents experienced this problem?
 
I would appreciate some comments!
