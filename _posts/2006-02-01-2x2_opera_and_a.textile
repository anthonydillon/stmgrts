2x2 OPERA was formed by local residents, film and video director Keith  Cheetham and Deborah Meyer, an experienced arts administrator and fundraiser, in response to the lack of opportunities for young people to take part in "classical" music projects. It's main aim is to provide an opportunity for local children and young people to participate in a professionally produced, high quality cross-arts education project. The projects also draw on the many professional talents from within the community making the productions unique and special not only to local residents but to the many visitors who attend the performances from outside the borough.  Their first production was four sold out performances of Britten's Noye's Fludde in March 2004, followed by Britten's The Little Sweep in March 2005.


Now in it's third year 2x2 OPERA is presenting "A Very Magical Flute":/cgi-bin/events.cgi?key=200602010748&action=getevent . This is a new and exciting adaptation of Mozart's "Magic Flute" by Keith to celebrate the 250th anniversary of Mozart's birth - a young boy, refusing to practice his flute, is transported back to 1791 and finds himself in the middle of a chaotic dress rehearsal for the first performance. He meets the opera's librettist, Emanuel Schickaneder, who gives him a singing role and explains the story interwoven with extracts from the opera. The boy experiences the frenetic activity that precedes the opening night – alongside petty jealousy's and gossip, the scenery isn't ready, neither are the costumes, the company has run out of money and Mozart hasn't actually finished the opera yet!

"A Very Magical Flute" promises to be 2x2 OPERA'S most lavish and ambitious project to date.  The production is directed by Keith Cheetham and conducted by William Carslake.  The performances are on Friday 24th March at 7.30pm and Saturday 25th March at 2.30pm and 7.30pm, all at All Soul's Church, Northcote Road, St Margarets.  Tickets are &pound;8 / &pound;4.50 available on the door or in advance by calling 020 8891 4641.


h3. How you can help

h4. Sponsorship

The success of our productions to date is due not only to the skills and commitment of those performing but also to the small army of behind the scenes helpers: we have received many comments praising the high quality of our productions and this is largely due to the generosity of our sponsors.  There are many ways in which local companies or individuals can help; sponsorship, by way of grants, donations or advertising is needed to help meet  our immediate production costs  such as professional fees, music hire, printing and PR whilst goods in kind could include timber, staging, sound and lighting equipment.  We would be delighted to hear from anyone who is able to help – or knows a "man who can"!
Our sponsors this year include Twickenham RFU and John Lewis Partnership but we still have a shortfall to meet before we can count on ticket income.  

h4. Singers

Calling all tenors and basses!   We need about 5 of each voice part to bolster the adult chorus.  All we ask is that you MUST be able to sing and hold a line and attend the relevant rehearsals.  Please contact Deborah ("deborah.meyer@meyermusic.co.uk":mailto:deborah.meyer@meyermusic.co.uk) if you would like to join in.  

h4. Volunteers

We also need a _small army of volunteers_ so if you fancy some behind the scenes experience why not consider one of the following:

* 2-3 people handy with jigsaws and electric screw drivers for set construction
* A transit type van (with driver) to transport set to All Soul's Church
* 4 stage hands – keen, enthusiastic and responsible teenagers NB. Also required to clear the set and Church after the last performance  
* Additional helpers to clear up after the last performance – the more the merrier!
* A large empty garage or workshop in which to construct and paint scenery.  We cannot use our artist's kitchen again!
 
Please contact Deborah if you or your company would like to be involved, or for general information.
