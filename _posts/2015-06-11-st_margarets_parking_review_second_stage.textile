For people living in the St Margarets area, you will hopefully be aware that Richmond Council is consulting on proposals to change the parking zone areas.

Following an initial consultation, the Council is now undertaking a 'second stage' consultation with specific proposals to extend Community Parking Zones S and S2 and to implement a New Zone S3. The Council is also re-consulting roads in the Heathcote Road/Cassilis Road area on proposals to extend the existing Zone S due to demand from residents of Heathcote Road and the displacement or 'knock on' effects a CPZ north of the A316 may have upon the area to the south.
