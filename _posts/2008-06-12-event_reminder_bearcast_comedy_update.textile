Sorry for the intrusion...

But late YESTERDAY we received the news from his agent that SIMON DAY will no longer be appearing at the Twickenham Festival show on Friday, due to filming schedules in Dorset being re-arranged.

This was a shock as you can imagine, but Grahame Limmer our estimable booker got straight on the case and I am DELIGHTED to announce that Mr Day's place will be filled most admirably by the wonderful OMID DJALILI!

Back from his critically acclaimed National Tour, during which he played 2 double matinee sell-out gigs at the London Palladium, OMID DJALILI is a comedy champion, fighting fit and, due to the great demands on his services will open the show at 8.45pm.

For those who have already booked, of course your tickets are still reserved. For anyone else, to reserve the remaining tickets to this show please reply to this email with your requirements ("see the event listing":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/event/show/200705141885).

The rest of the bill remains as stunning as before as OMID DJALILI is joined by

* Brilliant Royal Variety Ventiloquist PAUL ZERDIN
* Hilarious Country and Western Act WILSON DIXON
* Chav of Chavs LEE "NELSY" NELSON

This Twickenham Festival Show is on FRIDAY (TOMORROW) 13th JUNE 2008.
