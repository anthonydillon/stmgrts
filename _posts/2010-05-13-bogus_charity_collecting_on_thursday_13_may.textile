_SOS Clothes Ltd_ is collecting in St Margarets claiming to give proceeds to The Tree of Hope.  The SOS Clothes charity does not check out on the charity commission website. At first glance you would think that the collection is conducted by The Tree of Hope itself but this is not the case.  "Read an article on the Mirror":http://blogs.mirror.co.uk/investigations/2009/07/sos-clothes-silent-on-profit-f.html and decide for yourself.  Better to take your items to a legitimate high street charity.
