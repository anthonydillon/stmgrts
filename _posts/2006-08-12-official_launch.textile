Recognising residents' concerns and following Government guidelines, a new Police Liaison Group has been set up for the North Twickenham and St Margarets' ward. It was launched at a public meeting on Wednesday 19 July in the Winchester Hall, St Margarets.



The Group will be chaired by local resident and Cole Park Road Residents Association member, Jenny Aton. Jenny has experience with both the Police Consultative Group and the Neighbourhood Watch teams. 

The Group has been set up as part of the Safer Neighbourhoods programme, the objective of which is to get residents and the police to work in partnership to identify and tackle issues of concern in the area. 

Liberal Democrat Councillor Ben Khosa said: "We are delighted to launch this new liaison group in the ward as part of our manifesto commitment to boost the Safer Neighbourhoods programme and make our area a better place to live in. I am sure Jenny will get lots of local residents' support and further meetings are already planned to explore how the partnership can work effectively."

The team of normally six Police and Police Community Support Officers is dedicated to the community. In the meantime if you have any concerns please contact PS Arif Malik, PC Alan Richens or PCSO Lucy Burt and PCSO Eugenia Venour on 020 8721 2912, mobile 0787 9432330 or text 0778 1472588.
