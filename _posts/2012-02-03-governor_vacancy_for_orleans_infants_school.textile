"Orleans Infants School":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/directory/school/200506280125 has a vacancy for a Local Authority Governor.  Governors are vital to the running of the school and it is exciting being involved in new developments and helping the school improve and meet its targets. Having been judged outstanding by Ofsted the school is striving to maintain these high standards and continue to improve while ensuring the successful transition to a 2 form entry primary school. Governors need to have the time to commit to full governors meetings, committee meetings and other tasks, at least some of which take place during school hours. Skills in strategic planning, analysing data and human resources are always useful, but most of all we need someone who is passionate about school improvement. Please note that Local Authority governors should not be parents or staff of the school.

If you are interested, please contact the school office on 020 8892 1654 or "governors@orleans.richmond.sch.uk":mailto:governors@orleans.richmond.sch.uk
