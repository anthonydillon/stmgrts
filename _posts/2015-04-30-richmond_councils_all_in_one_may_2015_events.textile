_Your Vision, Your St Margarets, Your East Twickenham_

At the end of 2010 Richmond Council sent every household the All in One survey, which asked about the priorities of residents in each local area. We asked what people liked about  where they lived and what could be improved.

As a result of resident feedback, the Council has already made a number of changes in St Margarets and East Twickenham. Improvements include:



* An additional &pound;35k a year has been spent on improving roads and pavements through the  Community Road and Pavement Fund. Roads that have benefited include: Normanshurst Drive, Bridge Road, Broadway Avenue, Crown Road.
* Additional shopping bays and 30 minutes free parking has helped to increase trade in St Margarets.
* Orleans Infant and St. Stephen's Church of England Junior were converted from three form infant and junior schools into two form entry all-through primary schools in order to accommodate an extra reception class and to provide a third geographical reception intake point for the area.
* Additional affordable homes in the St Margarets and East Twickenham area as part of the Council's wider strategy.
* Funding through the Council's Town Centre Opportunities Fund for the St Margarets and East Twickenham Trader's Networks.

h4. What is happening now?

The results of the All in One survey also showed that residents had a desire to shape planning policy for their local area. Therefore, we want to work with the community to include a dedicated section within the Village Plans that will provide planning policy and guidance for East Twickenham and St Margarets.

Throughout the year, residents will have a number of opportunities to work with the Council to help shape the planning vision for their local area.

The next three events are:

h3. Drop in session - 16 May 2015

An opportunity to see the emerging ideas on your local area and for you to have your say on how current Council policy impacts on planning and development and how best to protect and enhance its character and conservation areas. We also want your views on your wider aspirations for your community, tell us your issues, concerns and ideas for improving your village and find out opportunities for getting involved.
