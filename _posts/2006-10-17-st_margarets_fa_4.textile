On 6 October, the St Margarets Fair Committee held a 'Race Night' event at the St Margarets Church Hall to raise money for local schools and community projects.  The night was a big success with over 100 people enjoying wine, cheese and virtual horse racing.

Nearly &pound;900 was raised for the Committee's annual senior citizens Christmas dinner on 6 December.  Additionally, on 6 December the Committee will present our local schools and community groups with the money raised by this years' St Margarets Fair.
 
The race event was sponsored by Real Ale Ltd, where profits from the bar went towards the charity and the cheese was generously provided at a reduced price by The Cheese Shop in Teddington.

Zeph King, from the event, said "a big thank you to all those who came to the event and supported us."
