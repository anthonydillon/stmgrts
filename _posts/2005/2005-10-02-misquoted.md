I happen to be away this week in New York from my brother's wedding, so I apologise for not having responded sooner. It appears I have been misquoted in the *Richmond & Twickenham Times*.

When I spoke to the paper, I told them that I would **not** offer my opinion, but *characterise* the arguments of both sides as I understood them.

I still haven't read the article, but I take it from a friend that it appeared that I came out in favour of the wine bar. While I do have an opinion, I have not shared it with the *Richmond & Twickenham Times* or anyone else. I will be contacting them to let them know their error.

Sorry about this, but it was beyond my control. As we mentioned in our [recent editorial](/archives/2005/09/message_from_th.html) we are trying to be unbiased as possible and "provide a means for discussion."
