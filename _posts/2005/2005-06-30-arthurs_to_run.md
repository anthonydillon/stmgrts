The Richmond Council have announced the selection of Tony and Adrian Rowe, owners of the popular Arthur's restaurant on Twickenham Green, to run the Twickenham Riverside Cafe. According to Tony Rowe, "we'll offer breakfast, lunch and dinner seven days a week and the premises will be non-smoking. We've given a lot of thought to the menu, which will include Tapas-style hot and cold food as well as exciting fare exclusively for our younger customers."

They plan to open sometime in July.
