The Mayor of the London Borough of Richmond, Councillor Robin Jowit, invites you to join him at Clarendon Hall, York House, for an evening of fun for charity. The event is on "9 September at 7:30pm at York House":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/cgi-bin/events.cgi?key=200508171643&action=getevent.

All proceeds are in aid of the Mayor's Charities: Integrated Neurological Services and ChildLine.

Councillor Hambidge has also offered to create a St Margarets' Team;

bq.. previous events have shown little representation from St Margarets' residents & I would be interested to know if there are 8 lovely people out there who would like to join me to make up a table for the night. A fun
night ... & very worthy cause I might add.

If so, to please phone me  8892 1748 leaving details for me to call back.
