The _St Margarets' Traders Association_ have worked with the council to ensure that parking is available for customers during the evening of the "Marble Hill House Concerts":/cgi-bin/directory.cgi?key=200505180441&amp;action=getlisting, which run on Saturday's from 13 - 28 of August. 

For this year's events certain parking restrictions will end at 7:00pm enabling customers of the local restaurants, 'take aways', pubs and the video shop to park legally. This will also take some pressure off residents parking spaces. 

The _St Margarets' Traders Association_ ask customers to ensure that they do not park in areas with cones during the posted restriction times.  However, the 'no parking' cones will be removed from the main commercial area of Crown Road from 7:00pm.
