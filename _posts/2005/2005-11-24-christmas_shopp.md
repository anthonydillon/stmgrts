On both Saturday, the 10<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup> of December from 11:00am â€“ 4:00pm the *St Margarets Traders' Association* will be offering Christmas street entertainment on Crown Road and St Margarets' Road to help entertain the kids.

-   Visit Santa in his gingerbread cottage, see a balloon modeller, Christmas fairies granting wishes, a Christmas competition that involves solving simple clues (the clues will be posted on selected shop windows -- solve the clues to enter the competition -- competition drawn at 4:00pm.)
    10 December 2005 from 11am-4pm
-   Visit Santa in his gingerbread cottage, see a balloon modeller, meet the *Pirates of St Margarets* and another Christmas treasure hunt

So forget about sitting in traffic waiting to get into Kingston's parking lots and shop in St Margarets.
