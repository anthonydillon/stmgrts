The [Orleans Infant School Fair](/cgi-bin/events.cgi?key=200505131056&action=getevent) was this Saturday afternoon and was clearly a big success, specially compared with last years near wash-out. Everyone seemed to be having a great day out and enjoying all the food and games.

Congratulations to Orleans and FOOI (the PTA)!
