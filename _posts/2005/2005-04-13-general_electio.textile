Tony Blair has called for a general election on the 5th of May.

To look up your ward, learn who your local Councillors are and where you vote, you can use "this online tool":http://www.richmond.gov.uk/wardfinder/lookup-street.asp.

If you cannot physically vote on 5 May, you can "arrange":http://www.richmond.gov.uk/depts/caring/legal/electoral/VoteByPost.htm to vote by proxy or post.

There is also a by-election for the Twickenham Riverside Ward.  If you vote in that ward, you can learn more about it "here":http://www.richmond.gov.uk/depts/caring/legal/electoral/ByElection/default.htm.
