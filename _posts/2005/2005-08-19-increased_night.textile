The Richmond Council has scheduled a "consultation at York House on 5 September at 7pm":https://stmargarets.london/cgi-bin/events.cgi?key=200508171626&action=getevent to allow residents to discuss plans for _increased_ night flights at Heathrow Airport.

All residents are urged to make a "loud and clear" statement on plans which would increase flights during the pre-dawn hours as early as 2006.


The public meeting has been arranged in collaboration with umbrella group HACAN (The Heathrow Association for the Control of Aircraft Noise).  

Chairing the meeting will be Council Leader Tony Arbour, who said:

bq.. Richmond Council has long pressed for an end to night flights and we regard plans to increase them with horror. This will further damage the quality of life of hundreds of thousands of people in west London.

We want a proper night curfew on flights.

The Council also opposes Government plans to add a third runway at Heathrow as, inevitably, this will increase aircraft noise still further.

p. Additionally, there is an "online survey":http://www.richmond.gov.uk/night_flights_questionnaire on aircraft noise to help the Council gauge resident's feedback.
