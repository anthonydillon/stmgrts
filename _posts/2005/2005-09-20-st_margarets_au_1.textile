The _St Margarets Autumn Fair_, held in Crown Road on Saturday, 17<sup>th</sup> September, was a big success.  Hundreds, perhaps a thousand, people came out to enjoy a day of live music, food, drink, clowns, art, a fun fair and more.

bq. "What a fabulous afternoon of music, food and stalls.  These community events add so much to the local area and thanks are due to everyone involved.  But for me the highlight was the dog show - I do hope that bubble-catching Sadie won the prize for Cleverest Dog!  I am now looking forward to the December Event for lights, music and Christmas Shopping."

h3. About the Event

bq. "The St Margarets Traders Association was very pleased with how the local community came out to help us put on such a wonderful event and hope for the same kind of response for the _St Margarets Christmas Fair_, whose planning will be starting soon.  The whole thing really came together because a lot of people did a little bit of work.  It was great to see."

p>. Simon Chapman from the _St Margarets Traders Association_

The event came together very quickly with only three formal meetings, a few emails and some individual's modest effort.  If you are interested in helping with the Christmas Event you can email us at "volunteer@stmgrts.org.uk":mailto:volunteer@stmgrts.org.uk or, again, speak to Simon at "Cutters":/cgi-bin/directory.cgi?key=200506090425&action=getlisting .
