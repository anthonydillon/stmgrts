The [St Margarets Autumn Event](/cgi-bin/events.cgi?key=200507211432&action=getevent) will be held in Crown Road on Saturday, 17 September 2005. The event is organised by a combined group of residents and traders and sponsored by the [RFU](http://www.englandrugby.com/). It promises to be a great community event with live music, food stalls, fun fair rides and more.

### Get Involved, Now!

One of the main goals of the event is for *local people to raise funds for local projects*. Fair organisers are still looking for local groups to come forward and set-up a stall or run a game at the fair.

The fair organisers, the *St Margarets Trader's Association* ([traders@stmargarets.london](mailto:traders@stmargarets.london), need to hear from you if you would like to help with fund raising or help with organising the event.

Since the event is for the community, the community needs to help with the event.

Perhaps you would like to raise funds for your school or club, a Christmas project or event, maybe you could help raise funds to improve the area such as floral displays or Christmas lights or you may have a charity that's dear to your heart and would benefit from some extra funding.

Additionally, there are a limited number of pitches available for sale for non-charities, so if you have your own business and would like to join in, please let contact the organisers. Funds from pitch rental from non-charity or local projects will go towards the local projects fund.

Planned events already include:

-   craft fair stalls
-   live music
-   fun fair rides
-   candy floss
-   competitions

The stalls will cost £15 if you pre-book and £30 on the day. *No charges are made for charity/local fund raising stalls.*

They are also looking for 'family oriented' bands, so if you are in a band, or know of one, please contact us. There is very little money for bands, so think of it as charity with good exposure.

If you are interested in participating in the craft stalls, please contact Simon Chapman at Cutters (<a href="mailto:simonchapman@stm.demon.co.uk">simonchapman@stm.demon.co.uk</a>).
