As part of the redevelopment of Brunel University's *Richmond Lock Campus*, [Ballet Rambert](http://www.rambert.org.uk/index.html), the oldest dance company in Britain, has submitted an application for proposed changes to Violet Needham Chapel and extensions to Clifton Lodge so that they be retained as an educational facility, as required in the [planning permission](http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/planning_decisions/2003/aug_06_03.jsp#brunel0608).

According to Councillor Hambidge, "this is great news for the local community" and that the application should come before the Committee in late July or the beginning of August.
