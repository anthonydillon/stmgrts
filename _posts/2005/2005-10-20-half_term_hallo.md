### 'Fairy Tail Week' at The Pottery Caf{e'}

Monday 24th - Friday 28th October.

This October there will be a brand new fairy pottery shape for the children to paint, plus a friendly dragon, also a first at the Pottery Caf{e'}. (£9.95 plus studio fee).

Children will also be encouraged to draw inspiration from a wide range of materials to create and depict their very own fairy tale on an item of pottery - be it a mug, plate, beaker or tile (prices from £5.95). The Pottery Caf{e'}'s own exclusive range of fairy tale decorating sponges will again be available during Half-Term - including a selection of many different fairies, toadstools, castles & dragons.

General opening hours are Monday 11-6, Tuesday to Saturday 10-6 and Sunday 11-5. To avoid disappointment, we advise booking studio time over the busy half-term week

### Activities and Plays at the Polka Theatre

The WORLD PREMIERE of their follow-up show THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD, based on the book of the same name. So join us at Polka once again for songs, laughs and scary fun for children aged 4 and up, and their adults!

In the Adventure Theatre during Half Term we have another unique event from Lyngo Theatre Company (who brought you 2004's Tom Thumb). The Birdy and the Eagle will be another very interactive, funny and exciting piece of theatre for children aged 3-6. As always in this small, intimate theatre space, tickets are limited, so make sure you don't miss out!

Loads to Do.

As always, there'll be loads to do at Polka during the holiday period. Here are details of two of our most exciting events this Half Term holiday:

On Tuesday 25 October, the Beans and Gari Puppet Theatre are joining us all the way from Ghana! Running two sessions for different age ranges (3-6 yrs & 7-11 yrs), you'll get the chance to see a brilliant puppet show celebrating some of the best of African culture, then work with the puppeteers to create your very own puppet characters!

Cracking Fun! on Wednesday 26 October is a great way to see The Birdy and The Eagle and also explore the story through gentle drama and storytelling activities. The workshop price of just £25 per child includes 2 show tickets for a parent and child to watch together.

Our box office team are waiting to help you on 020 8543 4888, or you can book show tickets online at [www.polkatheatre.com](http://www.polkatheatre.com/).
