#### Council Taxes set to Rise 3.5% in 2005-6

This makes the average tax for Richmond Borough (in Band D) Â£1,386, the highest in Greater London and the third highest nationally. While the increase is slightly lower than the national average increase of 4.4%, it still far exceeds (nearly double) the rate of inflation.[1]
