The *St Margarets' Traders Association* has applied to the Richmond Council for the right to adopt the Barron's Road recycling site. The goal is to use the money raised to:

-   Help raise awareness about the importance of recycling
-   Keep the site clean and tidy
-   Use the money to maintain the hanging baskets for 2006 (see our article, [Hanging Baskets Coming Soon](https://stmargarets.london/archives/2005/04/hanging_baskets.html))
