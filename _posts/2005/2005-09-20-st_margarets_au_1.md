The *St Margarets Autumn Fair*, held in Crown Road on Saturday, 17<sup>th</sup> September, was a big success. Hundreds, perhaps a thousand, people came out to enjoy a day of live music, food, drink, clowns, art, a fun fair and more.

A big thank you to all those who helped put on the day's event. Some major thanks goes to:

-   [The Rugby Football Union](http://www.englandrugby.com//), who generously supported the event
-   Simon Chapman of [Cutters](/cgi-bin/directory.cgi?key=200506090425&action=getlisting)
-   *The St Margarets Traders Association*
-   Paul O'Rielly, local resident and business owner provided the stage (at great cost)
-   Kim Hare of [Nigel Hare Joinery](/cgi-bin/directory.cgi?key=200506291050&action=getlisting)

.. and Ann Murray, Clair Wood and whole FOOI team, Sherralyn Rainey, Claire Wilson, Stephanie Grefsheim, Matt Grefsheim (aka Judge B. Arking), Karen Ranger (aka Judge Miss G. Ruff), Margaret Fenn-Nielson and Adrian Neale.

> "What a fabulous afternoon of music, food and stalls. These community events add so much to the local area and thanks are due to everyone involved. But for me the highlight was the dog show - I do hope that bubble-catching Sadie won the prize for Cleverest Dog! I am now looking forward to the December Event for lights, music and Christmas Shopping."

*Councillor Denise Carr*

### About the Event

> "The St Margarets Traders Association was very pleased with how the local community came out to help us put on such a wonderful event and hope for the same kind of response for the *St Margarets Christmas Fair*, whose planning will be starting soon. The whole thing really came together because a lot of people did a little bit of work. It was great to see."

Simon Chapman from the *St Margarets Traders Association*

The event came together very quickly with only three formal meetings, a few emails and some individual's modest effort. If you are interested in helping with the Christmas Event you can email us at [volunteer@stmargarets.london](mailto:volunteer@stmargarets.london) or, again, speak to Simon at [Cutters](/cgi-bin/directory.cgi?key=200506090425&action=getlisting) .
