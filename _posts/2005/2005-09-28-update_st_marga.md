We finally received a picture of the winner of the *St Margarets Autumn Event* Dog Show, Molly with her sisters; Imogen, Georgie and Cicely Green (click for a larger photo).

Molly was born and raised in St Margarets and is a Lakeland Terrier. Some trivia, the winner of the *Scruffiest Dog Contest* was Molly's brother.
