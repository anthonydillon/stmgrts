The Richmond Council has received a [planning application](http://www.ukplanning.com/richmond/showCaseFile.do?councilName=London+Borough+of+Richmond+upon+Thames&appNumber=05%2F2321%2FPS192) to renovate the former Phelps site at 133-135 St Margarets Road by the health and beauty store [Superdrug](http://www.superdrug.com/).

According to Councillor Annie Hambidge;

> People must realise that the Council have no powers to prevent a purchase between private parties.
> 
>  This Application will be for an existing retail outlet to continue as such therefore 'No Change of Use' to which anyone can object.
> 
 Additionally the application contains no details of how Superdrug will handle deliveries, trash or increased traffic; which is already an existing sore point with many locals, considering the track record of the neighbouring Tesco.

Councillor Hambidge urges residents to:

> decide how you feel about the changes taking place in St Margarets. The future lies in your hands ... do you want \[St Margarets\] to become another 'high street' or do you feel sufficiently concerned to make your voice heard.

If you are concerned about this, please comment on this site, email us at <editorial@stmargarets.london> and email Councillor Hambidge ([cllr.ahambidge@richmond.gov.uk](mailto:cllr.ahambidge@richmond.gov.uk)).
