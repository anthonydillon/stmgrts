After being refused by the council in March 2005 for essentially the same request, Tesco is applying for permission to put up new signs and lighting and completely covering the windows of the store.  They have commented in the application that the new look will be exactly like other shops on St Margarets Road as it uses some similar materials.

To review and comment on the application, you can look on the council website "here":http://www.ukplanning.com/richmond/showCaseFile.do?councilName=London+Borough+of+Richmond+upon+Thames&appNumber=05/3646/ADV.

Some of the concerns raised by local residents already have been:

* The use of raised 'pin foamex' lettering is not in accord with other premises in the area, nor is it in keeping with the conservation area.
* The use of coloured vinyl and frosting of the glass also adversely affects the appearance of the conservation area.
* The new spotlights are not of a design which accords with the Edwardian facade, nor are the colours used appropriate.
