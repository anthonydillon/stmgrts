On the 30<sup>th</sup> of October, St Margarets Councillor, Simon Lamb fired the borough's three highly respected town centre managers, including St Margaret's resident, Karen Pengelly, who was the Richmond Town Centre Manager.  The reason  given was to save money; however, at the same time they fired the managers, they created a fund with 2/3<sup>rds</sup> of the money saved going to an  'initiative fund' for local businesses to fund events.  The resulting savings to the Council is only &pound;20,000.


The decision has been met with uniform anger from local business to our local MP, Dr. Vincent Cable. The role of the town centre manager was to work with help local businesses and residents by creating a sense of community by jointly funding special events and helping improve the town centres for all to enjoy.  St Margarets benefited from Karen Pengelly's help in receiving _civic pride_ grants for Christmas Trees, Hanging Flower Baskets and helping market and organise the two street fairs in Crown Road this year alone.
