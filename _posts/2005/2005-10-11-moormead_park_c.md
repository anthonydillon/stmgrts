    Moormead Park is an important part of St Margarets, but hasn't been well maintained for years.  Now the Richmond Council has set aside a budget to help improve the park.  Additionally a new group has formed, the  _Moormead Park Group_, made up of local residents and representatives of the cricketers, footballers, St Margarets' Fair Committee and local businesses.  They have circulated paper questionnaire at the St Margarets Autumn Fair and door to door with local residents.

Moormead Park is an important part of St Margarets, but hasn't been well maintained for years. Now the Richmond Council has set aside a budget to help improve the park. Additionally a new group has formed, the *Moormead Park Group*, made up of local residents and representatives of the cricketers, footballers, St Margarets' Fair Committee and local businesses. They have circulated paper questionnaire at the St Margarets Autumn Fair and door to door with local residents.

Some of the ideas they are seeking input on are:

-   upgrading the playground and adding more equipment for older kids (£60k already set aside by the Council for 2006)
-   informal jogging track
-   a quiet area
-   corner/shelter for teens
-   a ball court
-   plant bulbs and meadow areas
-   caf{e'} or nursery in the pavilion
-   level and reseed the pitches (£20k already set aside for this year by he Council)

They are also seeking ways to fund some of this development.

Right now they have an [online questionnaire on the Richmond Council Website](http://forms.richmond.gov.uk/AF3/an/default.aspx/RenderForm/?F.Name=AVzmuIDxXXO). Please take some time right now to fill it in.

You can also email <parks@richmond.gov.uk) or call 020 8286 8455 for more information or to offer help.
