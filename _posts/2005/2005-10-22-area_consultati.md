The [Area Consultation Meeting](/cgi-bin/events.cgi?key=200510220252&action=getevent) for St Margarets and North Twickenham and Twickenham Riverside are scheduled for 31 October in The Salon, [York House](/cgi-bin/directory.cgi?key=200508171541&action=getlisting). This is a good opportunity to meet our local Councillors and Police Officers and have a say on issues of local concerns, for example:

-   graffiti and vandalism
-   controversial planning and licensing issues
-   loading bay, parking and traffic issues
-   park restoration plans

The *St Margarets Community Website* **strongly** urges residents to come out and have a frank and open discussion. With an election year coming up, we might find more willing ears.
