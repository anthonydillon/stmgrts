Local character Dylan, the chocolate brown Labrador owned by the Herdman family, has passed away this past 4th of October.  He had fought cancer over the last four years, but finally lost his fight.



bq. Dylan was always up and down Crown Road, in and out of our shop and could always be seen outside Chez's Cafe waiting for his sausages, and often took himself off for a swim at Marble Hill.  He was a free spirit and everyone seemed to know him.  Some folks thought that I didn't care for my friend because he spent much of his time off the lead, in fact it was the opposite, I never owned Dylan, even though I paid for him, he was his own man and came back home because he wanted to. He was a highly intelligent soul. He is much loved and missed.
