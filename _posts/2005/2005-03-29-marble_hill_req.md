[English Heritage](www.english-heritage.org.uk) has submitted an,

> Application for consent to erect marquees on rear lawn for not more than 16 events per year. Approval sought for trial 3 year period.

You can read the details of the [application online](http://www.ukplanning.com/richmond/showCaseFile.do?councilName=London+Borough+of+Richmond+upon+Thames&appNumber=04%2F0979%2FFUL).

We feel that this will:

-   increase the noise around the park
-   dramatically increase the amount of traffic in the area
-   restrict access to the park on these days

Please fill in the following form to send a comment directly to the Richmond Council:
