Cocoon Spa has recently ceased trading.  The former owner, Jane Franks, has contacted this site with information about outstanding vouchers.

bq.. "I am ... collecting post from the shop and if anyone wants to write to me, preferably with a photocopy of the gift voucher I do have two therapists who are happy to help me out with regard to this issue,  you can appreciate this is a difficult situation and under no circumstances is there any money available to refund any outstanding vouchers.
 
It was with huge reluctance that the company had to go into liquidation and I can only apologise for any inconvenience this has caused anyone."
