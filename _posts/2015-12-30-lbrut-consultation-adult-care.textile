Richmond Council is asking older and vulnerable residents and their carers for their views on proposals to change the criteria for receiving financial help from the Council towards the cost of social care services. Richmond Council is committed to providing high quality care and support to local residents who need help in their day to day lives. However, all councils are facing significant reductions in public funding for services whilst having to meet increasing demand for support and we are no different.

In Richmond, there is currently a capital limit of &pound;35,000 for non-residential services. The capital limit for residential services (care services in a care home is &pound;23,250).

h4. Richmond Council proposal

To reduce the upper capital limit for non-residential care services from &pound;35,000 to &pound;23,250 from April 2016.

_The consultation runs until the 18 January 2016._
