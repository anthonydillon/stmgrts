    "Whether the weather is cold.
    Or whether the weather is hot.
    You should weather the weather,
    Whatever the weather,
    Whether you like it or not!"
    </pre>
    
    What will the weather be like this summer? Shall I go cruising around the Grenadines on my private yacht or go caravanning on Hayling Island as usual?

Whatever the weather,
Whether you like it or not!"

To find the answer I turned once again to Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable... and once again it came up trumps.  Which tree gets its leaves first?

<pre class="poem">
If the Oak's before the Ash
Then you'll only get a splash;
If the Ash precedes the Oak,
Then you may expect a soak.
</pre>

Does anyone know what the Oak and the Ash have been up to recently?
