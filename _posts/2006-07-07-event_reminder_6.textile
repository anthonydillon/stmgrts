The Fair is a charity event and this year half of the income will go to the four local schools (Orleans Infant, St Stephen's CE Junior, St Marys CE Primary and Orleans Park Schools) in the area and the remaining income will go towards the refurbishment of the "Moormead Pavillion":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/directory/group/200510200949, an important community resource in urgent need of repairs.

The "programme of events":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/static/fair/smf_06_programme.html for this year's Fair include six bands, a football tournament, korfball, country dancing, a dog show, a charity auction and will be opened by Samantha Bond (aka Miss Moneypenny).
