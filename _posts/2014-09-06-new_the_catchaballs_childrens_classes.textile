_On Tuesdays from 2pm to 3.35pm at the All Souls Church Hall, Northcote Road_

Catch-a-balls is all about enjoying sport: we want to get pre-school children involved in and loving sport. Our classes are active to help children discover the fun in sport and physical exercise. We use a wide array of non-sport specific challenges so the kids develop good hand-eye co-ordination enabling them to handle any ball they wish whether it is a cricket ball, netball ball, rugby ball, tennis ball!
