> "A number of us in Godstone Road are forming an action group relating to the lease extension problem. Those of us living in maisonettes are now in position where the length of the lease on our properties is running short creating a potential obstacle if we were to try and sell. The landlords are now asking for Â£28k to extend to a reasonable 99 years. We believe that a great number of households are faced with the same dilemma."

-- *from Madeleine Menzies*

To help, we have set up a [forum](/cgi-bin/yabb/YaBB.pl?board=lease) where residents can discuss this issue.
