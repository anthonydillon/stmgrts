The pedestrian crossing on the north side of the St Margarets Roundabout is deadly.  Cars and vans are constantly turning North from the A316, and either not seeing the light in time, or just slamming their brakes on.

TfL say that it is safe, and that people do not run that light.  They even sent a man out for an hour in a bright yellow jacket looking like a policeman to prove it.

I want to convince TfL that people cannot see the red light, and that traffic should be halted when the man is green, to ensure proper pedestrian safety.
