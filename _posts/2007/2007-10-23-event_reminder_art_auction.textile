It's November, so it must be the "Art Auction":http://stmargarets.london/event/auction/200705141716


Once again the Environment Trust for Richmond upon Thames has the borough's art lovers in its sights, hoping to boost its charitable coffers at the very popular annual Art Auction. Once again many big-name artists have generously responded to the call for contributions -- and it's the big names that attract the big spenders. Royal Academicians Mary Fedden, Chris Orr and Bernard Dunstan have all given pictures. But often connoisseurs find a local artist to invest in too, and the auction will have plenty of pictures from borough-based professionals and amateurs with a strong local following.

The Trust's fund-raising this year is focusing on its ambitious River Centre project for Twickenham, a new community building with Sir David Attenborough as Patron. This will be a learning centre for sustainability and a focus for environmental volunteering, and will provide opportunities for river-based crafts such as boat-building and repair.

The Auction is on Thursday November 8th, at York House, Twickenham. Viewing starts at 7pm, the auction begins at 8pm, and tickets are &pound;5 (to include a glass of wine and canap{e'}s) from the Environment Trust on 020 8891 5455, or email "office@environmenttrust.co.uk":mailto:office@environmenttrust.co.uk
