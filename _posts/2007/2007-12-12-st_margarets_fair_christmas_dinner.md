Around a hundred of St Margarets more senior citizens had an early Christmas meal courtesy of the St Margarets Fair and everyone who supported this year's event. The venue was the Winchester Hall and the food was prepared by the Turks Head catering staff. During the meal last Wednesday evening 5th December, cheques were presented to three of the charity beneficiaries of this year's Fair. Collecting the cheques were Richard Robinson, Chairman of the River Thames Boat Project, Diarmaid O'Sullivan the branch manager of South West London Alzheimer's Society, and Claire Chapman the manager of Marble Hill Playcentres. Saturday the July 12th is the date of next year's 30th anniversary Fair, which as always will be on Moormead recreation ground.
