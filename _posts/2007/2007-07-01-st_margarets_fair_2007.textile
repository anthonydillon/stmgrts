The "29<sup>th</sup> St Margarets Fair":https://stmargarets.london/event/fair/200609190226 comes to Moormead on Saturday the 14th of July, between 11.30 and 7.30pm.

Our support this year is for the Alzheimer's Society, Heatham House and the Richmond Thames Boat project, in addition to our continuing help to Radio West Middlesex, Marble Hill play centres and our local schools.  There's live music on the stage from 11.30 onwards, and the usual established favourite activities, including  last year's new popular attraction - the dog show.  If you haven't had one already, you should shortly receive the full programme through your letter box. 

The Fair Committee have always strived to ensure that it remains primarily a Community event, and therefore we are always grateful for your support, and especially everyone living very close to Moormead. We all hope you have an enjoyable time in the sunshine we've come to expect for the day of the Fair.
