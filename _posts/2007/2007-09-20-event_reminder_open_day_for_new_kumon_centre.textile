A new Kumon Centre is opening in St Margarets.

Kumon offers individualised after-school study programmes designed to help children of all ages and abilities to fulfil their potential in maths and English.

Children work at their own pace, enabling them to develop self-confidence and learning skills that will give them the optimum chance of succeeding in life.

On Saturday, 22<sup>nd</sup> September 2007 they are "having an Open Day":https://stmargarets.london/event/meeting/200705141688 at the St Margarets Church.  If you are interested stop by for more information.
