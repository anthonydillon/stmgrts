Christmas is starting a little early this year. St Margaret's very own bop 'n' bayou band, the legendary 'Crane River Cajuns', are inviting you to their special "Cajun Christmas Party":http://stmargarets.london/event/show/200705141726 at the Red Lion, Linkfield Road, Isleworth on Saturday December 8th from 8.00pm.

What's on offer? Enough traditional beer to float the good ole "Robert E Lee", the most toe tapping, hot-to-trot music this side of the Mississippi... and better still FREE ADMISSION!

If you need a break from endless shopping, Christmas card lists, pudding stirring and demanding kids, hitch up the buggy and get yourself down to the Red Lion for some good old, down home hooting 'n' hollering, Cajun style!
