All the money's been counted and all the bills have been paid, leaving the Fair Committee to distribute &pound;17,000 of profit -- _over &pound;3000 more than last year_.  So a very big thank you to everyone in St Margarets for your continued support for our main community event.

Our three 2007 chosen charities will equally share &pound;7000, and our four local schools get another &pound;7000 distributed in relation to the jobs undertaken by members of the various school PTAs.  So this year Orleans Infants got &pound;1450, St Mary's &pound;1690, St Stephens &pound;1930 and Orleans Park &pound;1930.  The three charities sharing &pound;7000 are the Alzheimer's Society, Heatham House and the River Thames Boat Project.  We're also giving Marble Hill Play Centres &pound;500 and the 1<sup>st</sup> St Margarets Scouts &pound;500.

A further &pound;1500 has been set aside for the annual Christmas lunch at the Turk's Head for 100 of St Margarets older residents, leaving us &pound;500 in the bank for some of the expenses we encounter between Fairs.

Next year's Fair on "Saturday the 12th of July":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/event/fair/200705141685 will be the 30th and so it has to be extra special.  If you'd like to be part of its organisation then you're very welcome to be at our next Committee meeting which will be on Tuesday the 6th of November at 8pm in the Winchester Hall, next to the Turk's Head.
