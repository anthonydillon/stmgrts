bq.. "Since reopening the "Coach House Caf&eacute;":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/directory/restaurant/200705170747 in April we continue to be overwhelmed by the local support we've received and everyone we talk to is genuinely delighted that the caf&eacute; is open again and they seem very keen on what we have to offer.
 
We are on the hunt for a really good caf&eacute; assistant, who can make great coffee (quickly) and who can look after the customers. It would work really well if we could offer this position to someone with the relevant skill and experience within the neighbouring St Margarets' community.  If you are interested, full details of the job can be obtained by emailing Jenni at the "coachhousecafe@hotmail.co.uk":mailto:coachhousecafe@hotmail.co.uk".
