    The "report on the CPZ consultation has been published":http://tinyurl.com/2f4ww.
    
    Overall, 52% of households responded to the survey with 65% saying they do _not_ want a CPZ and only 36.8% saying they would want a CPZ on their road if everyone else wanted one.  Most people didn't care about the stopping up of the rear of 141-143 St Margarets Road (49.4%) or about a _car club_ (41.3%).
