There have been several new comments worth reading on "St Mary's Astroturf Planning Problems":http://stmargarets.london/archives/2007/05/st_marys_astroturf_planning_problems.html.  For example, this from a long note and email chain posted by Peter Hunt:


bq. "I have just read [Cllr] Trigg's letter to this forum.  I cannot believe that people so obsessed with process over common sense can manage to get elected.  I hope that any parents resident in his ward will take the opportunity to let him know directly that they do not consider his behaviour as supporting their needs as voters."
