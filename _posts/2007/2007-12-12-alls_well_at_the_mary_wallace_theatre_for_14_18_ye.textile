In 1991 the Richmond Shakespeare Society opened its doors to a younger generation and started its first Youth Theatre group. 16 years later one of the original members is back to return the favour! Karin Abbott followed in the footsteps of her father, Francis, by treading the boards at the Mary Wallace Theatre from an early age. Having watched her step-mother Katie and younger brother George continue on the tradition of the RSS Youth Theatre she felt it was time to give something back.


For years there has been a gap in the society where the youth theatre ends and the main house productions begin. After a lot of deliberation The Richmond Shakespeare Society is now proud to announce a new youth theatre group specially designed for young people aged 14 - 18 years, much to the excitement of current Youth Theatre members Fenella Hawksley-Walker and Emily Dixon! Both were delighted to hear that there would be somewhere for them to move on to once their time with the RSS Youth Theatre comes to an end next summer. James Cooper, an ex-member, was also enthusiastic about the idea of a new group forming and, along with the two girls, has booked himself in to take part in the free taster session on Saturday 15th of December!

Led by former Youth Theatre member Karin Abbott and partner Simon Radford the All's Well Youth Theatre will meet every Saturday at the Mary Wallace Theatre in Twickenham and work towards a full scale production in the summer. Both trained and professional actors, Karin and Simon are very much looking forward to passing on their knowledge and experience to the new group. Following on from the fantastic work produced by the RSS Youth Theatre, All's Well will take the older age group to a new level, and offer the opportunity to look at other areas of the theatre world as well as acting. So whether it's directing, backstage or lighting that excites you, All's Well Youth Theatre will have something for everyone!

<div class="box">A free 'taster' session will be held at the Mary Wallace Theatre on Saturday 15th December from 10.30am - 12.30pm to give an idea of the exciting things to come!</div>
