The _Learn & Play Bridge_ group (see "article":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2007/04/learn_bridge_in_the_park.html) at the "Coach House Cafe":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/directory/restaurant/200705170747 in Marble Hill Park got off to a quiet start on Friday morning 11<sup>th</sup> May with a table of players enjoying a game.  Bridge teacher Ned Paul who has set up the weekly group with the support of the cafe commented:  "Time flew by as we got to grips with a few basic hands, although we were able to pause a long enough to have a cup of excellent coffee and a delicious piece of cake.  I'd like a few more players to join in.  The group is ideal for anyone who would like to start bridge or for those who have played before but whose knowledge is a bit precarious.  The group is going forward on an informal basis where you need only attend those Fridays when you are free.  I'll ensure that everybody who comes progresses whatever your starting standard and however many sessions you can attend."

The group meets at the Cafe at 10am on Fridays and plays until noon.
