The following has been highlighted by a local resident.

> "Can I draw residents attention to a planning application which has been submitted to open a hand car wash on the Chertsey Road (A316) at the end of the parking area for the offices. Details are on the link below - not sure if residents on the opposite of the Chertsey Road have been informed but it involves building an office and the erection of large Perspex shelter - not very pleasant to look at. Residents have contacted ward councillors - Cllr Philip Morgan has responded to state that he will support resident's objections."
