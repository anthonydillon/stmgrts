Friends of the Museum of Richmond will be the benefiting charity from the popular annual 1940's "Big Band Blitz":http://stmgrts.org.uk/event/show/200705141717 at York House, Twickenham on Saturday 10 November 2007.

The Deputy Mayor of Richmond and her guests will step back in time to the 1940s.  Big Band Blitz 2007, produced by Aspects Productions, will again re-create a special 1940's Glenn Miller wartime evening of big band music, dance and entertainment, featuring the legendary music of Glenn Miller and other Big Bands of the period.

The authentic setting with 1940's Period Dress and Memorabilia, Live Music and Celebrity Guests, Dancing, Food and Drink from the NAAFI, Licensed Bar, the Air-Raid Warning, and Spam, will make this a unique 1940's party, and enable guests to experience the atmosphere of those bygone days.

This special event will feature the critically acclaimed Jon Bennett Big Band, whose many credits include appearances at the Savoy Hotel, Australian High Commission, the Lyceum and Dominion Theatres in London's West End, and the Royal Gala Performance at Richmond Theatre.
