A group of local residents who own vines or would like to, are forming a wine growners co-operative locally. If there are enough of us we can get our crop professionally bottled under our own label next autumn. If you fancy joining us and quoffing some Chateau St Margarets next year, get in touch with the *St Margarets Wine Growers Group*.
