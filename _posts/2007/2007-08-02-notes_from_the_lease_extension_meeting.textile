The Winchester Hall was packed to bursting on Tuesday 24 July evening when 90 local residents attended a presentation given by LEASE. Both the Lease extension and Collective Enfranchisement were discussed and a show of hands indicated equal interest in both options.  The benefits of forming a group to share costs of the negotiations were discussed and next steps will be distributed to those who provided their contact details
