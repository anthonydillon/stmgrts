On the heels of [Council's rejection](/archives/2007/07/planning_permission_refused_for_chase_buchanan.html) of Chase Buchannan's application to convert the old Kobler's Bakery, anyone who objected received a letter (<em>see the [comments here](/archives/2007/07/planning_permission_refused_for_chase_buchanan.html) )</em> from Nick Jones, acting for Park Hill Investments to solicit support for [converting part of the basement into a flat](http://www.ukplanning.com/richmond/showCaseFile.do;jsessionid=4A2AB995A404D570DD58286BCE883315.wam1?action=show&appType=planning%20folder&appNumber=07/2588/FUL). The carrot was that "we have taken your comments on board and are now trying to source a retail tenant that will be more in keeping with the St Margarets area such as a bakery".

Well it appears they are good to their word and have found a tenant:

> "Further to my recent letter concerning the planning application by Chase Buchanan I am pleased to report that we have now agreed terms to let the shop to L'Amandine. Some of you will be familiar with L'Amandine, they run a small chain of Continental Patisseries.
> 
> L'Amandine will occupy the ground floor shop premises and the front one-third of the basement area. We are hoping that all of the legal formalities can be tied up in the next 6 weeks, so we might see the shop operational again by the end of September.

We will continue to provide you with updates as matters progress. We are delighted to have secured L'Amindine as a tenant and I believe that this letting goes a long way to meeting the local residents requirements."
