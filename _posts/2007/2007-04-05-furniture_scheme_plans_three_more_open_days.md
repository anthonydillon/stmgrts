The [Furniture Scheme Richmond upon Thames](https://stmargarets.london/directory/charity/200703111434) collects donated furniture for the primary purpose of making it available to people in need. However, we always have surplus furniture and are keen to ensure that this gets reused. With this in mind we have decided to open to the general public. This has two purposes:

1.  to help us increase the rotation of furniture in and out of the warehouse so we reuse more and reduce the amount going to landfill
2.  to help us generate some much-needed funds to keep going

To give working people an opportunity to get to know us we are opening (with the help of volunteers) on the first Saturday of the following months for two hours from 10am-12pm:

-   [Saturday, 5<sup>th</sup> May 2007](https://stmargarets.london/event/Meeting/200704050218)
-   [Saturday, 2<sup>nd</sup> June 2007](https://stmargarets.london/event/Meeting/200704050220)
-   [Saturday, 7<sup>th</sup> July 2007](https://stmargarets.london/event/Meeting/200704050219)

*This is a three-month experiment only.*

However the Furniture Scheme is also open to the target group referred to above 10am-3pm Mondays to Thursdays -- our usual opening hours.

The furniture we collect is of a good quality. You may find something special. Come and visit us and see for yourself.
