Armstrong's Family Butchers opened in St. Margarets on Monday 6th August.

They offer at least a dozen varieties of sausages, free-range eggs, pasties, pork pies and cooked ham as as a superb range of meat including prime scotch beef, organic pork, and free-range chicken.

It's nice to see that whilst thay have modernised the shop they have also managed to keep much of the original features of Mr Frisby's shop intact.

Armstrong's opening hours are:

|                 |              |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Monday - Friday | 8am - 6pm    |
| Saturday        | 7:30am - 4pm |
| Sunday          | closed       |
