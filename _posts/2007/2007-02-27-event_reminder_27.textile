    Forget Woodstock and Reading, the place to be this Friday is the Winchester Hall in St Margarets when the doors open promptly at 7.30pm for "Turkstock II":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/event/Concert/200702270210, a band fundraiser for St Stephen's CofE School.
     
    Last year's event raised a fantastic £600 for St Stephen's CofE School and this year's bash promises to be even bigger and better with four hot local bands. The line-ups are all St Margaret's bred talent, featuring dads from St Stephen's CofE School.

Forget Woodstock and Reading, the place to be this Friday is the Winchester Hall in St Margarets when the doors open promptly at 7.30pm for "Turkstock II":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/event/Concert/200702270210, a band fundraiser for St Stephen's CofE School.
 
Last year's event raised a fantastic £600 for St Stephen's CofE School and this year's bash promises to be even bigger and better with four hot local bands. The line-ups are all St Margaret's bred talent, featuring dads from St Stephen's CofE School.
 
* *Tamil*
Two members from last year's headline band "Shadow" open the show with an eclectic mix of acoustic and electric numbers. 
* *Bulge*
Well-known local glam-rockers. They regularly appear at fundraisers for the Shooting Star Hospice
* *Doghouse*
Dad-rock at its best, Doghouse opened Turkstock last year, as well as appearing at Moormead Fair and Shooting Star gigs.
* *Nark Drool & the Shudders*
Pure rock 'n' roll.  A favourite with North St Margarets - they are a regular turn at the Residents' Association parties - this great local band guarantees to have everyone strutting their stuff until late into the night.
 
Doors open at 7:30pm and, with such a packed programme, the bands will start promptly at eight.
 
A big thank to Paul Jensen, landlord of  the Turk's Head, for providing us with such a brilliant venue and Fuller's Brewery for donating a barrel of London Pride to the event.
 
Tickets are £5 and to get one contact Sherralyn on 87442301 or Yolande on 88915051 or buy one from the St Stephen's School Office. But hurry, they really are selling like hotcakes!
