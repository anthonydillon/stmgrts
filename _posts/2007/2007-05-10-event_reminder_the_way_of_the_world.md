*fops, fools, and ferocious wit*

There's a time-travel opportunity coming up soon, for one week only, at the Mary Wallace Theatre. On May 19th Twickenham's delightful club theatre will be transformed into an early 1700s playhouse, for William Congreve's [The Way of the World](https://stmargarets.london/event/Play/200705100745).

The spirit of a bawdy age will come alive again, and audiences will be welcomed by periwigged gentlemen and saucy orange sellers. Three of the five acts -- as the playbill points out -- take place in a bedchamber. It was all so startlingly modern for its time, that the critics of the day turned up their noses at it. More fool they. Amongst other delights it contains one of the most celebrated battle-of-the-sexes scenes ever, and subjects the vices and stupidities of the age to mercilessly comic scrutiny.

Unlike so many modern revivals of restoration comedy, this production will be in authentic period costume. As the next instalment of the Richmond Shakespeare Society's 2007 season Theatre Through the Ages, it's an evening of fun not to be missed.

The show runs from Saturday May 19<sup>th</sup> to Saturday 26<sup>th</sup> inclusive. Performances start on at 7.45, with matinee performances at 4.00pm on Sunday March 20<sup>th</sup> and 3.00pm on Saturday 26<sup>th</sup> There is no performance on Wednesday 23<sup>rd</sup>.

Ticket prices are £7 for the first three performances, and £8 thereafter. Seats can be booked via the telephone box office: 020 8744 0547. Credit card bookings are now accepted (MasterCard and Visa only).

*The Way of the World* is produced by the Richmond Shakespeare Society, which is a registered charity. Further information is available from the Director, Maxina Cornwell, on 07957 616 474 or email <maxina@msn.com>.
