Alistair has worked in radio for over 20 years  and has now found his spiritual home at Radio Jackie presenting his show Monday through Friday from 2 until 4pm.

Alistair takes an active part in the _St Margarets Fair_ each year introducing the live bands on stage and hosting the auction for the last few years.

The highlight of his broadcasting career to date was presenting a show from the back of a motorised four-poster bed. Away from the station, Alistair plays cricket, his second passion in life, for his local team _Crossbats Cricket Club_ in St Margarets.
