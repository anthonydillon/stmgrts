*Go on, spoil the maternal one in your life this Mothering Sunday!*

Have you sorted out your Mother's Day present this year? Mothering Sunday will be upon us before you know -- Sunday March 18th is just around the corner.

Well, look no further, the PTAs at two local schools, St Stephen's Church of England School and Orleans Infant School, have come up with a winning formula to answer all your gift needs for this special occasion. On offer is a fabulous package to light up the lives of mums and grannies everywhere. This includes a copy of the schools' much-acclaimed cookery book, Come and Get It, and chocolates from Marks and Spencer. It comes beautifully packaged and delivered to your door (if you live locally) for just Â£10! We can also send it to your Mum for a small postage fee.

Come and Get It was published in December and has become the must have volume in St Margarets. It is brimful of recipes from parents, teachers and governors at the schools and was published to raise funds to improve the playgrounds at both sites.

"The cookery book is proving a good fundraiser for our schools. Many people bought the book for Christmas presents and have told us they will be doing the same for Mother's Day, so it made sense for us to come up with a special offer. The book is proving successful because it does benefit local schools and the recipes are the tried and trusted favourites of the people of St Margarets," said Sherralyn Rainey, joint chair of St Stephen's PTA.

If you would like to take advantage of this Mother's Day offer call Sherralyn on 0208 7442301 or email on <sherralynrainey@aol.com>.
