If you enjoy singing, come and join the Richmond upon Thames College Community Choir.

Rehearsals take place on Thursdays 6.30-8.00pm in the Music Centre at Richmond upon Thames College. Membership costs Â£20 per term.

The choir is run by music lecturer, Caroline Heslop, and our repertoire is varied. We are currently preparing a programme for Christmas in which the community choir and chamber orchestra will join forces to perform mediaeval carols, new works and excerpts from Handel's Messiah. Each term the choir performs in venues around Twickenham and Richmond.

No previous experience or ability to read music is required to join the choir, just lots of enthusiasm for singing! All songs taught by ear alongside some vocal score reading. NO AUDITIONS.

Singing is an enriching and rewarding experience. Come and discover your voice in a relaxed and friendly atmosphere. New members always welcome!

For further details, contact Caroline Heslop/Rachel Smith 020 8607 8221 or email <cheslop@rutc.ac.uk>.
