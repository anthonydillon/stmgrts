After a review of the "recently increased fees":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2007/03/outrage_at_st_s.html, the Richmond Council has decided to reduce the fees for St Stephens C.E. Junior School to use Moormead park from &pound;1,600 per term to &pound;534 per term.  Last year they paid &pound;450 per term.

Additionally, the Council will increase their funding to the school to cover the cost of the charge.
