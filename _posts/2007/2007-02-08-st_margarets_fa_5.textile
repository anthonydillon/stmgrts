h4. Programme
 
For the sixth year running we are producing a 32-page glossy-backed programme for the Fair which is being designed as a directory of local businesses and services in the St Margarets and East Twickenham areas. Prices range from £150 for a full page to £20 for an eight of a page.  Please contact Zeph King ("zephking@btinternet.com":mailto:zephking@btinternet.com) or Anna Evans ("anna.evans@dlapiper.com":mailto:anna.evans@dlapiper.com) for further details.
 
The programme will be hand delivered to more than 5,000 homes and businesses in the area. It will contain a useful index which local residents can keep beside the phone throughout the year.
 
The Fair is organised entirely by volunteers and all funds raised will
shared (after costs) between four local schools and three local charities.

_Note: this website does not represent the fair, although we certainly try to help in any way we can, so please do not contact us for information about Stalls or Programmes._
