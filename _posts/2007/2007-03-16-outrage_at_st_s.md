Richmond Council has decided to increase what it charges [St Stephens C.E. Junior School](https://stmargarets.london/directory/school/200507170243) to use Moormead park from £450 per term to £1,600 per term (down from an amazing original £2,400 per term increase).

Currently the school is refusing to play.

A group of parents at St Stephens is organising a petition against the council's outrageous 356% increase. The petition is outside the school's office and in the playground after school during pick-up time.
