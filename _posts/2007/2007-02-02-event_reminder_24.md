    Alce Harfield has <a href="https://stmargarets.london/event/Exhibition/200702020423">a show</a> running from 3 - 17 February at Par Ici at 40 Church Street in Twickenham.  She was born in Sussex in 1966 into an unusually artistic family. She grew up surrounded by photographers, art teachers, architects and printmakers, so it came as no surprise when she embarked on an artistic career of her own.

Alce Harfield has [a show](/event/Exhibition/200702020423) running from 3 - 17 February at Par Ici at 40 Church Street in Twickenham. She was born in Sussex in 1966 into an unusually artistic family. She grew up surrounded by photographers, art teachers, architects and printmakers, so it came as no surprise when she embarked on an artistic career of her own.

She studied at Worthing College of Art, prior to gaining an honours degree in Interior Design from Leicester Polytechnic. Painted in acrylics on paper, Alce's work betrays a wide range of influences stemming from her love and knowledge of other artists. Eager to experiment, she is well known for a broad spectrum of work, including landscapes and cityscapes, figurative pieces and more whimsical contemporary imagery. The years of hard work and dedication have now paid off and she has a loyal following which is growing constantly.
