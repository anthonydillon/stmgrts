Our 5 year old cat Tama is missing and wonder whether you have seen him.

He is a light ginger and white couloured Maine Coon (large cat with long hair).  Unfortunately he is not wearing a collar as we found it in our garden. He is microchipped.  

We miss him very much and are very worried as he has never stayed  away this long before.  He usually stays in the area (St Margarets South) but has been known to wander into neighbours' houses, sheds - anywhere with an open door. 
 
We last saw him on Monday morning 19 November 2007.
