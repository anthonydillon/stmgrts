Dear Cheese Lover,

Just a quick note to let you know that this year's "Christmas and New Year order form is now available to download from the yellowwedge cheese website":http://www.yellowwedge.com/christmas_2011_order_form.pdf. Orders by the 15<sup>th</sup> of December please.

At the moment we don't have the facility for you to place your Christmas orders on line, but if you want to arrange a local delivery from elsewhere, or to request a UK mainland delivery, please phone or email and we'll get back to you.

From 13<sup>th</sup> December we're open every day up to and including Christmas Eve - detailed opening times are listed below.

And whatever your plans for the festive season, our very best wishes from all of the team at yellowwedge cheese!
