There is going to be a Cornish Farmers Market at The Turks Head. Organised by "Marghas.co.uk":http://www.marghas.co.uk (which means market in Cornish) it will be selling Honeys, Clotted Cream, Meats, Fish, Vegetables, Herbs, Cut Flowers and more more. There will be free tastings of Cheeses, Wines, Ciders, Pasties and as well. The market starts from Midday on Saturday, 13<sup>th</sup> June 2009.

"Marghas.co.uk":http://www.marghas.co.uk is a small business started up by an ex-St Margarets resident who lives in Cornwall and the local area is being used as the first part of London to target. I've been buying off them for the past  month or so and the quality is fantastic.
