With the current problems regarding anti-social behaviour and youth violence Performance Academy London is endeavouring to change the self-image of children in the local area.  We thought you might be interested in putting this information onto your website.

In September 2010 Performance Academy London will be launching exciting new drama workshops for children aged between 8-12 years old in Whitton. These workshops have the aim of encouraging self esteem and confidence in the next generation. The company director Robert Wells believes in the importance of using drama as a tool to encourage positive self images in the younger generation. 'I have seen drama transform children's confidence and self belief... the shyest and most difficult children have developed a love of theatre and been a given a platform so that they can express themselves positively.'

Performance Academy London has worked with children in Richmond, Merton and Chiswick. They have seen how drama has helped to transform children's attitudes on life. All children have developed a real excitement for theatre and performance.

The new workshops will provide a great opportunity for children to develop their speaking and listening skills, as well as, improving their self-confidence and self-esteem.

The Classes will be held at St Philip and St James Church Hall Kneller Road, Whitton, Middlesex TW2 7DY.
