Between the Locks is a two-year oral history project to record the lives of people making their living from the river and the heritage of the Thames river community, bounded by the locks at Richmond and Teddington, centred on Twickenham and Eel Pie Island. The project is being run by the Environment Trust for Richmond Upon Thames, supported by funds from the Heritage Lottery Fund and Hampton Fuel Allotment Charity.

The project brings together school students from Christ's with elders of the river community. As well as recording the elders' voices, the students are carrying out some of the practical activities of boatbuilding, lock-keeping, riverbank management and other skills. Sound and video recordings of the project will be made available to schools, libraries and community centres via DVD and the internet and a travelling exhibition, designed with the help of the students, will ensure that the stories are shared with the local community.



Between The Locks is hosting a reminiscence morning, "River-niscence, on Wednesday 23<sup>rd</sup> September at Vestry Hall, Paradise Road in Richmond":http://stmgrts.org.uk/event/meeting/200705142218. The event will run from 10:30am to 12:30pm and is an opportunity for those who worked on the river or who were and are part of the river community to reminiscence about life and work, exchange stories with old friends and our young interviewers! You supply the story, we'll supply the tea! We hope to see you there!
