The league tables of England's primary schools are out today and Richmond Borough is ranked first in the nation for the fourth year in a row, but has "slipped slightly":http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/6209672.stm this year.  St Mary's did particularly well, but all the local schools ranked highly.
