Dear Fellow Residents
 
As you are aware Twickenham Studios is undergoing a major refurbishment. We are planning to upgrade many of our production suites and have had building work taking place at the site. We had planned a break in the building works for the festive period but unfortunately we have had to recommence the works early, this is because the recent heavy downpours have caused us further problems with leaky roofs.
 
We are working hard to minimise any local disruption and I though it best to let you know what is going on at the studios via the community website.
 
I do sincerely apologise for any inconvenience caused.
 
Maria Walker
Chief Operating Officer
Twickenham Studios
