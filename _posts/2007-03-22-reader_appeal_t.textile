bq.. "The road surface in The Barons is in very bad condition and is once again pock marked where the surface has been peeled off.  It dangerous for cylcists like myself.

The road has never been re-surfaced in over 15 years.  They patch it and the patches come off.  It looks horrible.

I've asked Richmond Council a number of times to schedure a re-surface but they say "... no money".

I have once again asked for their help.

Can I ask through your Newsletter that other Barons residents, who feel the same, please report the problem to Richmond Council?"
