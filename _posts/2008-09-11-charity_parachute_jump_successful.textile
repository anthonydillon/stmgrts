    "Michael Hanrahan":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2008/07/disabled_mans_charity_parachute_jump.html did his charity parachute jump on 12 August.
    
    A very big thank you to everyone who sponsored him at the quiz night. He raised a total of &pound;350.20 on the night and a further &pound;440 online. Big thanks also to sponsors John Lewis, M&S, Majestic Wine Twickenham, Bruges at the Old Goat, RFU and The Pirate Club at Camden Lock who all supplied great raffle prizes.
