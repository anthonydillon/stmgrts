We asked Tim Beale, the Visitor Operations Manager of Marble Hill House, why only two concerts this year?  Here was the reply:

bq.. "With IMG pulling out of managing the concerts we were initially faced with the prospect of no concerts. Luckily MA concerts stepped in but as you can imagine this was at quite a late stage so almost impossible to book good artists at such short notice.
 
We are still hoping that the amendment to the premises licence is granted to allow us to have a third concert on the Friday night."
