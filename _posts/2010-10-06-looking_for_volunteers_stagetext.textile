    Captioning on stage works in a similar way to subtitles on a foreign film - except as well as displaying dialogue from the play, it also shows sound effects, music descriptions and other noises (such as coughs!) too! In this area, both Richmond Theatre and The Rose Theatre, Kingston schedule regular captioned shows.

Being deaf can be an isolating experience so in setting up the groups we are aiming to not only encourage more people to see captioned plays at local theatres, but also to enable people to socialise and mix together. Hopefully we'll achieve both aims!

We're setting up a number of groups, but starting in Richmond first of all, so passing on this information would be really useful in helping us to spread the word! (we are a registered charity so would make no profit from this)
