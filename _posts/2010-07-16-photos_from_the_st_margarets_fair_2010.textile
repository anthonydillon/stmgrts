The 2010 St Margarets Fair was a huge success.  As usually there was wonderful food, great music, terrific stalls, fun rides, fun dog show and weather a bit hot, but not too much.  Thank you to the Fair Committee and all the volunteers who work so hard to make the day special.

This year Martyn Day has taken some lovely photos. Please take a look at the "slideshow on flickr.com":http://www.flickr.com/photos/mahnke/sets/72157624513399152/show/.  If anyone has other photos, please email them to "content@stmgrts.org.uk":mailto:content@stmgrts.org.uk

_Update_

There are many more photos at the "St Margarets Fair Website":http://www.stmargaretsfair.org/photos2010/index.html as well.
