The St Margarets Traders Association have arranged the necessary police/council/insurance requirements to allow carol singers to sing around the centre-piece Christmas tree in St Margarets on the three Saturdays prior to Christmas. If you would like your group/school/church etc to sing and collect for your chosen charity please contact the association at "traders@mystmargarets.com":mailto:traders@mystmargarets.com. There are some guidelines that have to be followed and booking is required.
