_Office is space is urgently needed to two people to use on a part-time basis._

Anything from a self-contained room to just two work stations would be ideal. It doesn't need to be furnished and it can be in a shared space.

The David Adams Leukaemia Appeal fundraises for the Royal Marsden Cancer Charity. During its 23 year history it has raised over &pound;1M, which has been used in such things as: funding research posts, a nurses' library and co-supporting state-of-the-art research and diagnostic centres. The charity runs events locally and around London and is a member of Richmond Chamber of Commerce.



The two people who use the office are currently based in St Margarets and are ideally looking for their new office home to be in the St Margarets/Twickenham area.
