Richmond Council is looking at plans to use the CPZ parking permit fees to encourage cars with low CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The current proposal would actually lower the cost of permits for people with smaller, more efficient cars, but raise the price of a permit by 200% for the worst polluters.

According to a recent survey by primemove.com, Richmond borough is one of the most likely to have large 4x4s, 63% more likely than the average area in London, with 5,099 cars registered since 2001.

|Local authority|Index*|Number of Cars**|
|City of London|513|706|
|Kensington & Chelsea|215|7,252|
|Westminster|198|8,277|
|Richmond|163|5,099|

 * Index score: likelihood of owning a 4x4 where norm is 100
 ** Number registered since 2001

Richmond Council is asking for feedback on this proposal with an online "questionnaire":http://forms.richmond.gov.uk/AF3/an/default.aspx/RenderForm/?F.Name=NAJupv7axm0
