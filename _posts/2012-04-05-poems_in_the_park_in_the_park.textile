For those looking for a bit of local exercise and outdoor cultural inspiration over the Easter Holidays, look no further than Richmond Park.

The winners', runners-up and commended poems from the the Poems in the Park competition, organised by the Friends of Richmond Park, are currently on display in Pembroke Lodge Gardens in the Park.  One of the joint-winners in the adult category is St Margarets resident Chris Rice with his clever, witty poem Kingfisher, Beverly Brook and there are other brilliant poems from local and nearby residents in the other age categories, 13-18 years and 12 years and under.


You can "read some of the poems":http://www.frp.org.uk/news/177-poetry-winners-celebrated and look at photos of "the display in the Park":http://www.facebook.com/#!/thefriendsofrichmondpark.

Writer Dame Jacqueline Wilson, who was one of the judges of the 650 poems received, said of the poems: "I'm a veteran of judging children's poetry competitions, but these entries were truly outstanding. It's maybe a combination of the talent of our local children and the inspiring beauty of Richmond Park."

Local charity, the Friends of Richmond Park, organises competitions, walks, talks and other events based in the Park and you can follow them on Facebook or on "www.frp.org.uk.":http://www.frp.org.uk.  The charity has 2,000 members living locally and are always looking to attract new members interested in the preservation of the Park and conservation of its diverse wildlife and environment.
