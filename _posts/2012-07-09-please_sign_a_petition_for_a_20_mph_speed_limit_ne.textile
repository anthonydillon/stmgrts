_Petition for 20 mph speed limit and other traffic mitigation in the vicinity of St Mary's School on Strafford Road, Twickenham._

The opening of a new school in Strafford Road makes traffic mitigation imperative. Strafford Rd., Oak Lane and Amyand Park Rd. together function as a 'rat run', the only route between central Twickenham and central St Margaret's for drivers seeking to avoid congestion on Richmond Road (an 'A' road). With the support of the school's Governing Body, we request a speed limit of 20 mph in Strafford Rd.; pedestrian crossings across Strafford Rd., Amyand Park Rd., and Oak Lane; and other measures such as speed bumps or narrowings of the carriageway on Strafford Rd.
