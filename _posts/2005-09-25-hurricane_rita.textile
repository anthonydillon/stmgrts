<div style="border: 1px solid #333; background: #C6BCED; padding: .5em; color: #000;">As strange as it may sound, this site is hosted on a server that is in Texas.  While the ISP doesn't expect any direct problems, as they are well inland, they have warned us that there may be issues with the networks in general when the storm makes landfall tomorrow.  So if you have issues accessing the site over the next few days, this would be the likely reason.</div>
