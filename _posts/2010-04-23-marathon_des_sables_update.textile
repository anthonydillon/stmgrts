_The hottest and hardest ever to celebrate the 25<sup>th</sup> ultra race!_

A huge thank you to all those who have sponsored me at my just giving site ("www.justgiving.com/Georgie-Islip":http://www.justgiving.com/Georgie-Islip) and to all those that tracked me during the race, I feel very humbled by it and the wonderful emails I received whilst I was in the desert were amazing and really kept me going. Thank you.

I finished the race but have not had the time to write up a full account. I will do for the next week. Just to say that I was one of the 900 who finished and I have the feet to prove it! The race was tough particularly because of the water restrictions and heat. The running wasn't bad!

Thank you again,

Georgie
