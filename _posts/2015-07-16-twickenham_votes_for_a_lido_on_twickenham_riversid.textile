During consultations with local stakeholders it has become clear that there is a wish to bring back a Lido on Twickenham Riverside. Twickenham Alive has identified a successful "courtyard" style lido in Bristol which would fit into the site available.

The success and popularity of the Lido in Bristol has given the Bristol Lido the confidence to invest in a second Lido in Reading. The Bristol Lido concept is a proven financial success which would ensure the long term future and sustainability of the facility. More importantly though, it provides the local people with an everyday escape from modern life, an accessible urban retreat. The Richmond Card would be welcome at the lido and spa.






Should the Twickenham Alive proposal be accepted by Richmond Council, the guys from Bristol Lido would be happy to come to Twickenham and build a lido on Twickenham Riverside providing the funding and organising the build; supporting the Twickenham Lido on a financial and operational level.

We have the finance, the expertise and support, and only need around a quarter of the site available, so we ask Richmond Council to accept the proposal to reinstate Twickenham Lido on Twickenham Riverside which would go forward at no cost to the taxpayer or the Council and provide a leisure and sport facility for the people of Twickenham and surrounding areas.

Such a facility on Twickenham Riverside would act as a magnet and contribute to the rejuvenation of the town as well as providing a sport and leisure facility for local people. We also propose to reinstate boathouses on the site which were lost during the Second World War which could be used by local river based sports clubs such as the Stand Up Paddleboarding club and the proposed Eel Pie Museum.

Twickenham Riverside used to be a vibrant area for the local community with its lido and boathouses.

Please support our petition and help us persuade the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames to reinstate Twickenham's Lido.
