Shooting Star Chase is a leading children's hospice charity caring for babies, children and young people with life-limiting conditions, and their families.
Whether lives are measured in days, weeks, months or years, we are here to make every moment count. We support families from diagnosis to end of life and throughout bereavement with a range of nursing, practical, emotional and medical care.



Our Sunrise Walk is a great way to get together with your family, friends and colleagues. The 13 mile walk is open to both men and women. Dogs and children are of course also welcome on the walk. The walk will start before sunrise so don't forget your torch!

Last year our first sunrise walk saw 300 walkers raising &pound;48,000 for Shooting Star Chase. This year we're looking for 400 walkers to take part and we aim to raise over &pound;60,000. Sign up today to be a part of something special!

No matter what your fitness level you can take part and raise vital funds to support local families with babies, children and young people with life-limiting conditions.

The walk takes place on Sunday 1<sup>st</sup> June at 4:30am. We're looking to attract walkers from all backgrounds, not just experienced walkers, but families with children who are looking for something different and exciting to take part in.

The route will take you past some picturesque sights including Richmond Park, Richmond Hill, The Thames, Ham Common, Bushy Park and Home Park near Hampton Court Palace.

We're looking for 400 walkers to take part. Are you up for the challenge?
