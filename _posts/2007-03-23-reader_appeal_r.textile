bq. "I would like to let the people of St Margarets know that if, like me, they get woken up at night by aircraft noises landing at Heathrow it is possible to send a complaint about it to BAA and Richmond council. Have a look at "this Council webpage":http://www.richmond.gov.uk/home/environment/pollution/noise_pollution/aircraft_noise/aircraft_noise_complaints.htm and email or call them to let them know that the noise of aeroplanes landing at 4 am wakes you up.  If nobody lets them know then they won't write it in their reports and they
will assume everything is OK."
