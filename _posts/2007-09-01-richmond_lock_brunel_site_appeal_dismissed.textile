The Planning Inspector has dismissed Octagon's appeal against the Council's refusal of planning permission for:

# the replacement of basement parking by spaces for parking in front of the houses, 
# the omission of one of the two proposed water features and 
# the reduction in size of the other. 

This is good news indeed, not only for residents of St Margaret's but for the Borough's planning system as a whole: it will encourage Council Officers and the Planning Committee to take a robust line in resisting over development and insisting that promises made before permissions are granted must be fulfilled. Your ward councilors; Geoff Acton, Ben Khosa and Philip Morgan, fully supported residents on this and had several meetings with residents, Octagon and Council Officers.
