    For those of you who have not been in Moormead Park lately, work has begun on the refurbishment of the playground.  Starting about three weeks ago, the old playground has been completely removed as well as the fence parallel to Moormead Road.
    
    Currently only the brick outlines of the new toddler and children's areas are visible.  However, the Council still hopes to have all work completed by the St Margarets' Fair on 15 July.
