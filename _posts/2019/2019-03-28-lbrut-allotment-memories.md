Stories about allotments will be celebrated at a dramatic performance at Twickenham Library next month, as part of the regular reminiscence cafe.

The Reminiscence Cafe is a monthly free event at Twickenham Library for residents aged over 55 years old. Over a cup of tea, attendees will be able to share memories and stories about the local area and times gone by in an informal and friendly setting.

On the 5<sup>th</sup> April, the Questors' PlayBack team will be putting on a special show 'Memories of the Allotment' that will celebrate stories of life on the allotments of west London, as told by the people who work and enjoy them.

A small team of community theatre performers will bring the memories alive through readings, songs and little sketches. The show will last approximately 35 - 45 minutes, and after the show, the actors will chat with audience members over a cup of tea, hearing their own reminiscences.

Cllr John Coombs, Richmond Council Cabinet Member for Arts and Culture, said:

> "As the weather gradually gets warmer more of our green fingered residents are out in their gardens or allotments. The reminiscence cafe is an opportunity for older residents to come together and share their gardening memories and stories. All whilst we are enjoying a cup of tea and some cake. As an older resident myself, who is a keen allotment holder...I might pop along myself!"


For more information call 0208 734 3301 or email [libraryvolunteer@richmond.gov.uk](:mailto:libraryvolunteer@richmond.gov.uk). The event is on Friday 5 April from 11am-12.30pm at Twickenham Library.
