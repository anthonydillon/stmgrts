Ninety five percent of in-borough applicants have been offered a place at one of their first three preferred primary schools.

Yesterday (16 April), Richmond Council made the initial allocation of Reception class offers for this September. This year, 2,247 pupils applied for a place - compared with 2,174 last year.

85% will be offered a place at their first preference primary school, compared to last year's figure of 88% and 2017's figure of 84%.

Currently there are no children without an offer of a primary school place.

Cllr Penny Frost, Richmond Council Cabinet Member for Children's Services and Schools, said:

> "I am delighted that we have again been able to offer such a high number of parents a place at their first preference school.


> "Our schools are deservedly popular owing to the fact that they continue to top the league tables and offer excellent, inclusive education for local children."
