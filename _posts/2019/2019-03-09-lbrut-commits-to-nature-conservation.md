    A new policy outlining the Council's commitment to protecting and enhancing nature conservation in the borough has been launched.

    Richmond upon Thames is made up of nearly 60% of open space. This includes over 130 Council owned and managed parks. The borough is also a London 'hot spot' for bats and Stag Beetles and the only place in London where the rare Tower Mustard (Arabis galabra) can be found.

A new policy outlining the Council's commitment to protecting and enhancing nature conservation in the borough has been launched.

Richmond upon Thames is made up of nearly 60% of open space. This includes over 130 Council owned and managed parks. The borough is also a London 'hot spot' for bats and Stag Beetles and the only place in London where the rare Tower Mustard (Arabis galabra) can be found.

The Council has a statutory duty to protect and preserve all wildlife and local environmental habitats for the future.

This new policy sets out how we will seek to protect, conserve and enhance nature conservation in the borough. This includes a biodiversity consideration for all planning applications, the creation of new opportunities for wildlife to thrive, encouraging landowners to manage their greenspace well, raising awareness of local nature and importantly working in partnership with others.  This includes the Richmond Biodiversity Partnership.

Cllr Martin Elengorn, Richmond Council Cabinet Member for Environment, said:

> "This borough has many important sites of nature interest and a range of significant habitats. We have the responsibility of protecting this biodiversity for the future and our environment team is engaged in doing this.


> "The new strategy reinforces our commitment to making sure the borough continues to be one of London's most important ecological resources."
