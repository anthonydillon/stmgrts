StreetInvest is hosting a coffee morning at the ETNA Community Centre in Twickenham to celebrate the International Day for Street Children on the 12<sup>th</sup> April.

Come along and enjoy a coffee and slice of cake with friends and colleagues and hear from StreetInvest's Street Champions in Ghana, India and Kenya, through video live stream. We will be interviewing a Street Champion in each country, so you can gain an insight into this global moment for street children, and be part of their day.

StreetInvest's amazing supporters are also holding coffee mornings around the country in their own homes and offices.

#### Introducing the Street Champions

This year we are shining a light on our Street Champions: incredible street children who have received facilitation and leadership training through StreetInvest. On the 12<sup>th</sup> April, three of our partner organsiations in India, Ghana and Kenya will be hosting consultations with government representatives and the Street Champions, so that these young people can challenge those who have the power to affect positive change in their lives on a national level.

So come along for a cup of coffee, a slice of cake and and be part of the Street Champions' day!
