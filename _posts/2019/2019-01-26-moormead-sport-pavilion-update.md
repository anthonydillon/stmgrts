Just before the end of 2018, we had a pre-planning meeting with Richmond Council - and we were delighted to hear there were no significant issues with our proposals.

We want a regenerated pavilion to include a caf&#233; selling light refreshments, toilets with baby changing facilities and storage for community activities such as the annual St Margarets Fair, junior parkrun, junior cricket and Saturday morning football.

But our biggest challenge is how to try to accommodate everyone's ideas in a new pavilion no larger than the current building.  We have developed our proposals in consultation with the Friends of Moormead Committee and other local organisations. Our focus is on residents living within a 20-minute walk of the park.  We want more inclusivity; we want the younger, older and less able members of the community coming to the park, whilst serving all the people who use Moormead as a place for quiet reflection, dog-walking or playing sports.

We estimate the total cost will be &pound;500,000.  Our funding plan will target donors such as the Big Lottery Fund, the Rugby Football Union, the England and Wales Cricket Board, the London Marathon Charitable Trust - all in addition to funding from the Richmond Council.

We have applied for Gift Aid status and will soon be launching a crowdfunding website to raise funds from our local community. Two local architects have donated their services for free: Leigh Bowen from 50&deg; North Architects and Suzanna Heape from SLR Architects.  A huge thanks to both of them!
