The area around Richmond Green and the Riverside greeted the new year in a clean and green state thanks to the help of a group of young people from the Ahmadiyya Muslim Youth Association.

More than sixty young volunteers turned out in Richmond on New Year's Day to help clean the green and Riverside following New Year's Eve revelry.

The clean was one of a number completed by 9,000 volunteers in fifty cities across the United Kingdom.

Volunteers were provided bags and equipment by the Council to help with the clean-up.

Cllr Martin Elengorn, Cabinet Member for Environment said:

> "Whilst many of us were having a rest on New Year's Day these community minded young people were out ensuring Richmond Green and the Riverside started the year in immaculate condition.


> "Thank you to all the volunteers who gave up their morning to help with the clean-up."
