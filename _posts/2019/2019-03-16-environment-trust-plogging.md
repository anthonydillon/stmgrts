Plogging - jogging and litter pickingPlogging is a combination of jogging while picking up litter. It comes from the Swedish word for pick up... "plocka upp"  It started as an organised activity in Sweden in 2016 and has recently come to the UK.

As a workout, it provides variation in body movements by adding bending, squatting and stretching to the main action of running.

If this appeals to you then why not join our new group starting in the New Year.

### When and where?

We will meet at 9am on the first Monday of each month outside the [ETNA Centre, East Twickenham](https://stmargarets.london/directory/other/201110040733).

Great British Spring CleanMonday 1<sup>st</sup> April is a special plogging session in support of the Great British Spring Clean. Keep Britain Tidy are aiming to inspire 500,000 people to join forces - in partnership with community organisations, businesses and the government - to collect and safely dispose of litter from our streets, parks and beaches, recycling as much as possible.

So join us, as we prepare to stand together and declare that litter pollution, including single-use plastic - which degrades the beauty of our environment and threatens to harm wildlife - is not acceptable.

### What you will need?

Just your running shoes, all equipment will be provided.

### Fee:

This event is free but if you can, please Donate towards our conservation work we would be grateful.
