Are you looking to live a happy, healthy life? Then look no further than Richmond upon Thames.

The borough has been rated amongst the best places to live in the United Kingdom in the '2019 Thriving Places Index' by the charity, Happy City.

Richmond upon Thames scored particularly highly in the Local Conditions theme, rating as the 4<sup>th</sup> best place overall in England, and the 2<sup>nd</sup> best nationally for the mental and physical health and education and learning elements of the theme.

The theme includes five elements of good living: Place and Environment; Health; Education; Work and Economy and; People and Community.

The 2019 Thriving Places Index is a framework established by the charity, Happy City which measures the wellbeing of an area's population. It uses a set of publicly available performance measures to rank Council performance from Low to high (for example the percentage of people aged 15+ reporting good or very good general health).

Cllr Gareth Roberts, Leader of Richmond Council said:

> "The survey results confirm what we in Richmond upon Thames have known all along - this is a wonderful place to live, love, work and raise a family in.


> "Knowing our residents are rated amongst the healthiest both mentally and physically is a great endorsement of the array of welcoming community groups, activities, clubs and open green spaces we enjoy in this borough."
