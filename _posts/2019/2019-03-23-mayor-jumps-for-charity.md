    I know that people have been interested whenever I've mentioned my planned Skydive on Sunday 24 March 2019 with a group of other similarly motivated dare devils from 15000 feet in the air. We're jumping from an airfield in Kent.

Many people have donated already and many have verbally committed to support. We are in the last push to raise funds for this. But it struck me that you may not have the link to be able to support this fundraising effort. If you feel able to support my team, please use the justgiving link - [www.justgiving.com/fundraising/mayors-office2](https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/mayors-office2)

If you do not use justgiving, then the Mayor's Office is happy to accept good old-fashioned cheques made payable to 'The Mayor's Charities' and of course we'll look at the odd spare gold coin you may have lying around.

There is a serious point as I want to raise as much as possible for Refuge to help those who have experienced domestic violence. &pound;50 pays for one nights emergency shelter for someone who may be at the lowest ebb in their life.

I'm honoured to be able to use my position as Mayor of LBRuT this year to help this most vulnerable group in our society.

You may also want to consider joining me at another one of my fantastic events, please take a moment to see relevant links below.

Thank you for helping me.

Cllr Ben Khosa
