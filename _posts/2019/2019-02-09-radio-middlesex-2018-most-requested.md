Radio West Middlesex, the hospital radio station at the West Middlesex University Hospital, has counted up the requests they have collected from patients during 2018 and have revealed the most requested artists and songs.

Station volunteer and presenter, James Hoff said, "We played over 800 requests during our four weekly music request shows last year, which interestingly reflects the diverse range of musical tastes our listeners have".

Once again 'My Way' returns to the top of the chart as the patients favourite song and it's Elvis Presley's turn to be last years most popular artist.

The radio station seen out and about hosting and entertaining the crowds at St Margarets Fair each year, broadcasts 24 hours a day aiming to brighten up the stay of patients featuring specialist programmes, relaxing music, health and local information for the community.

It's not just hospital patients that can listen to the voluntary-run hospital station. Anyone can listen using the TuneIn radio app or online via their website - [radiowestmiddlesex.org.uk](http://radiowestmiddlesex.org.uk/). To cheer up a patient in hospital, you can request their music choice by emailing [studio@radiowestmiddlesex.org.uk](:mailto:studio@radiowestmiddlesex.org.uk) or by texting the word 'WEST' followed by the song title and artist to 84433 and don't forget their name and ward they are staying in.
