The hunt for an architect to help design the future Twickenham Riverside site has begun - with the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA).

Earlier this year, Richmond Council agreed to commission the RIBA to deliver an OJEU compliant Design Competition.

The Royal Institute has extensive experience and is a widely recognised provider of architectural competitions, delivering high profile selection processes for both private and public-sector clients.

They have been supporting the Design Panel to develop a new Brief for the site and following this launch, they will also help guide the evaluation of the expressions of interest and designs submitted by the shortlisted architects.

Over the coming weeks RIBA will invite architects to come forward and express interest in working with the Council on the Twickenham Riverside site.

Cllr Gareth Roberts, Leader of Richmond Council, said:

> "Twickenham Riverside should be the flourishing centre of Twickenham and the local area, but instead it's being used as a car park with parking prioritised over people. For nearly 40 years this beautiful stretch of the river Thames has been awaiting a design that can showcase the riverside as a destination for people to live, play, work, enjoy and thrive. We are delighted to be working with RIBA Competitions to find an architect who has the vision and skills to deliver a design which creates a heart for Twickenham.


> "Understanding the history of the site is key, but now it is time to look forwards. This is a great opportunity to deliver real change through an exciting, energising and fabulous design. We must invest in the future of Twickenham. I very much look forward to seeing the designs and working with the chosen team to make the riverside a destination we can all be proud of."


Sarah Williams, S Williams Architects, acting as the RIBA Adviser, added:

> "It's not often that architects get the opportunity to design a scheme along this stretch of the River Thames. Added to that is the Council's aspiration to create something beautiful and valuable for the local community; a collection of places, spaces and buildings that can bring vibrancy and focus to this part of Twickenham. I'm looking forward to helping the council with this next stage of the project's development."

The Design Panel is made up of the Leader of the Council, Cabinet Member for Environment, Cabinet Member for Business, a local ward councillor, a representative from the Local Stakeholder Reference Group and an independent adviser from the Royal Institute of British Architects. In addition, two local representatives with architectural experience.

Supporting the process is a local Stakeholder Reference Group. This group is made up of existing local groups and organisations with links to the Riverside and an interest in it its future regeneration. Together they will be responsible for communicating the views of local people, businesses and groups to the Council, disseminating information, offer opinion and advice around key project decisions and feed into, where appropriate the Design Competition.
