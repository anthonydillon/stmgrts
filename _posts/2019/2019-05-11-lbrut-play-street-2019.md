Families in Richmond are again being invited to come out and play as part of a national Car Free Day this September, with a scheme aimed at encouraging children to play outside.

Following last year's successful trial, Richmond Council is encouraging people to hold a play street on the 22<sup>nd</sup> September, by offering to close their roads to through-traffic for up to four hours.

It means children will be able to play outside, have fun with their friends, family or neighbours.

To encourage as many streets as possible to take part, the Council is again waiving the administration costs to the road closures, and to help inspire the play, we are again making available a number of grants of up to &pound;250 to enable neighbours to plan fun activities that will entice people out of their homes and onto the streets.

This announcement follows the Council's commitment to the Play Street programme, as part of a London-wide campaign by London Play and Transport for London, encouraging all London boroughs' to participate in the scheme.

Cllr Alexander Ehmann, Richmond Council Cabinet Member for Transport, Street Scene and Air Quality, said:

> "Last year over thirty streets across the borough took part - with fun activities ranging from bouncy castles, to street skittles, or just children allowed to play outside their homes. We had the highest number of play streets in London.


> "I hope that even more residents take the opportunity to replace the well-worn noise of car engines and with the hum of neighbourly chatter and the sound of children's laughter. Let's have even more play streets than last year!"


Cllr Gareth Richards, Richmond Council's Cycling Champion, signed the London Play 'Car Free Day' play street pledge last week. He said:

> "We have a wonderful set of parks and open spaces across our borough, but turning the street outside our homes into a more rich and rewarding space; one that brings communities together and allows young people to laugh, play and have fun is a great opportunity


> "As a borough we have signed the London Play and Transport for London Pledge to encourage as many streets as possible to close their road for up to four hours."


People will have to get permission to have their street closed and as part of the process they'll need to speak to their neighbours in case there are any objections.

Residents will also be responsible for organising and supervising their event, including ensuring someone is there to allow safe access if required for residents' cars and emergency vehicles.

Anyone can apply, providing their street isn't a main road, bus route or emergency vehicle route.
