<em>PSPO around Rosslyn Road BPAS Clinic a step closer following overwhelming public backing.</em>

A Public Space Protection Order (PSPO) is a step closer to being introduced around Rosslyn Road BPAS Clinic following approval by the Council's Regulatory Committee last night (6 February).

It comes following a six-week long formal consultation which received over 3,000 responses.

The Committee determined that the evidence presented through the consultation satisfies the two conditions for a PSPO as set out in section 59 of the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014.

Under that Act a PSPO can be implemented if activities carried out in the local area have had a detrimental effect on the quality of life for those in the locality and that the effect is of a persistent and continuing nature so as to make activities unreasonable.

More than 80 per cent of respondents to the consultations agreed or strongly agreed that the behaviour around the BPAS Clinic in Rosslyn Road had a detrimental effect on them or others in the local area.

Robyn Thomas, Head of Community Safety for Richmond Council said:

> "We have received a number of complaints over recent years regarding protests being held outside the BPAS Clinic in Rosslyn Road, which have caused those accessing and working there distress.


> "Following a thorough and lengthy consultation, where over 3,000 individuals and groups took part, the overwhelming majority have told us that they want a PSPO around the Clinic.


> "This PSPO is not designed to tell vigil holders and protestors they cannot protest or pray in this borough. The order has been designed to ensure that their rights to free speech must be balanced with the lawful rights of the users and staff at the Clinic.


> "The proposal will now be considered at the Full Council meeting later this year."


The committee also agreed to extend the zone to include St Margarets station.

Should the PSPO be implemented, those breaching the order would be served a Fixed Penalty Notice involving a fine. Persistent breaches of the Order could result in prosecution and a criminal behaviour order.
