The Real Junk Food Project Twickenham have launched another day at ETNA Community Centre due to the success of the Monday caf&#233;.

*Every Tuesday from 2 pm until 5 pm.*

It is run on a pay as you feel basis, everyone is welcome. All the food prepared comes from local supermarkets and bakeries and was heading for landfill, so do come and try it out.

To date the caf&#233; has saved 4.4 tonnes, so let's feed bellies not bins!

- Monday Caf&#233; - 11 am until 1 pm
- Tuesday Caf&#233; - 2 pm until 5 pm
