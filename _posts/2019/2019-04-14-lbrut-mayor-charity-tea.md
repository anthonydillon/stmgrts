Residents are invited to attend a special afternoon tea event with the Mayor of Richmond upon Thames and the naked ladies of York House.

Guests attending this charity event for the Mayor, Cllr Ben Khosa, will be able to enjoy a special 'Darjeeling' afternoon tea in the Winter Gardens at York House.

Following this, attendees will be invited to a tour of the building, gardens and famous Naked Lady fountains with guides from the York House Society.

There will also be performances from the Richmond Academy of Dance.

The event will be on Friday 10 May from 3.30 to 5pm. Tickets cost &pound;20 and includes afternoon tea, with prosecco, which will be provided by local caterer - Plum Duff.

All proceeds will go to the Mayor's charity - Refuge. Refuge supports more than 6,000 people by helping them to rebuild their lives and overcome whatever type of domestic violence and abuse they may have faced.

York House is a historic stately home in Twickenham. It is Grade II listed and is scheduled as an ancient monument, dating back to the 17<sup>th</sup> Century. With its unique history and architecture, it currently serves as the Municipal offices for Richmond Council. At the back of the house are magnificent gardens. Created in 1906, Sir Ratan Tata created the sunken garden and placed a group of marble figures, or the 'naked ladies' at the far end.

Cllr Ben Khosa, said:

> "I have been Mayor for the past twelve months and this will be my last charity event. I want to make it a great final push to raise money for a very worthwhile charity.


> "I am inviting residents into our beautiful building - particularly as I know many people will have never been inside or indeed know that there are splendid statues in the gardens.


> "I hope as many people are able to attend the tea party. I can guarantee everyone three things - the food will be perfect, the company will be spot on, but most importantly - Refuge will benefit from all ticket sales."
