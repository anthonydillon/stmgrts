Residents, businesses and commuters are being notified of major gas mains upgrade works taking place Richmond Road, which are planned to begin on 25<sup>th</sup> March and will continue for approximately eight weeks.

Works will start opposite St Stephen's Church on Richmond Road, and will finish at the junction with St Margarets Road.

There will be temporary traffic signals in place until 7<sup>th</sup> April, which will be manually controlled between 7am and 7pm daily to optimise traffic flow.

For the remaining six weeks of the project starting 8<sup>th</sup> April, there will be a southbound directional closure in place on Richmond Road, junction with St Margarets Road. Traffic will be diverted along St Margarets Road, onto the A316 Chertsey Road, then onto the A310 London Road and finally Arragon Road. There will also be bus stop closures and diversions on affected routes. Buses will use Crown Road to maintain services to the local area.

This will require some parking suspensions along Crown Road for the duration of the directional closure to assist bus movements. Please note that St Stephens Gardens will be closed for the duration of the works, with a local diversion in place.

We apologise for any inconvenience and appreciate the patience shown by residents, businesses and commuters in and around Richmond Road whilst Cadent Gas complete these works.

Residents who have concerns or queries should contact Cadent Gas on 0800 1512404 or alternatively email [customer.care@triio.co.uk](:mailto:customer.care@triio.co.uk) including your postcode.
