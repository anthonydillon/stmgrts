A Plan to conserve the borough's richly diverse plant and wildlife for future generations was launched yesterday at the London Wetland Centre in Barnes.

Richmond Council Cabinet Member for Environment, Planning and Sustainability, Cllr Martin Elengorn joined Sir David Attenborough, members of the South West London Environment Network (SWLEN) and others to help launch the Richmond upon Thames' Biodiversity Action Plan on Thursday (9<sup>th</sup> May).

The Plan has been produced by the Richmond Biodiversity Partnership - a partnership of organisations and residents, working to protect the local biodiversity - in association with Richmond Council.

It outlines the species and habitats which should be prioritised, where they are located, what is being done to conserve them and what land owners, managers and residents can do to help protect and enhance local wildlife for future generations.

Speaking at the event, Cllr Elengorn said:

> "We owe it to our children and grandchildren to save the rich biodiversity that still exists and can continue to exist. Let's all continue to work hard and keep our courage up."


Colin Cooper, Chief Executive of SWLEN said:

> "What difference does a biodiversity action plan make? It means 1.5km of new hedgerows, restored and expanded reedbeds, over 1km of river restoration work, large scale stag beetle loggery and bird box installation, mistletoe regeneration, dozens of hedgehog sightings."


Sir David Attenborough said:

> "I am so heartened that an audience of this kind should turn out to consider local action plans of the most practical and most humble level.


> "This work is modest and unpretentious, but nonetheless crucial.


> "If we can't look after this environment, who can? The enthusiasm, insight and knowledge that is so evident, makes me feel very privileged to be living where I do."
