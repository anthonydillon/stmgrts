excerpt: |
    A newly formed local band, playing R&B music of the 1960's/70's, has everything it needs - a guitarist, a bass player, a drummer, two singers, a PA system and even a bottle opener and cork screw. The only thing lacking is a keyboard player.

#### Could it be you?

Age, experience and gender are immaterial. The only requirement is enthusiasm and the ability to rattle your way around the chords of such R&B classics as 'Green Onions', 'Mustang Sally' and 'Mockingbird'.
