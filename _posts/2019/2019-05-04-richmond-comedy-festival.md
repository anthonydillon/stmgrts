Nish Kumar, Jason Byrne, Mark Watson and Luisa Omielan are among the comics lined up for the inaugural Big Funny Fest, Richmond's first comedy festival taking place over Father's Day weekend, the 15 & 16 June 2019.

Big Funny Fest is packed full of the hottest, most exciting new and established comedians performing live at the historic Old Deer Park, in Richmond Upon Thames.

The line up also includes Hal Cruttenden, Phil Wang, Adam Hess, Lou Sanders, Rhys James, Jayde Adams, Darren Harriott, Olga Koch, Stephen Bailey, Desiree Burch, Glenn Moore, Tom Ward, Lloyd Griffith, Tanyia Moore, Angelos Epithemiou and many more, including a chance to see the stars of tomorrow with the Amused Moose National New Comics finalists.

There are three shows in a fully seated Big Top, an afternoon, early evening and evening, each featuring 3-4 comedians.  The fully seated Little Top hosts 4 shows. There will be comedy on somewhere every minute from 3pm until 10pm both days. Every show ticket gives full access to see all of the shows and comedians performing at the Big Top and on a first come basis at the Little Top.

Since Father's Day is not complete without some dad jokes the Festival sponsor, the independent brewery Shepherd Neame is offering a brewery tour, lunch and a supply of goodies for two, plus festival weekend tickets, to the winner of best Dad Joke. Submit your joke on Twitter by Saturday 1<sup>st</sup> June using #bffdadjoke and our team of top Dad Comedians (Mark Dolan and Hal Cruttenden) will select the one with the classic cringe factor.

These star-studded shows take place inside the historic landscape of the Old Deer Park and the riverside location boasts a competitively priced bar and a selection of hand-picked local street food vendors.
