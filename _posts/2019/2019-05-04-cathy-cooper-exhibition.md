Take a journey through six decades of life via the camera lens of photographer Cathy Cooper in the latest exhibition on at the Stables Gallery in Twickenham.

'Cathy Cooper: Life Through a Lens' showcases images from the near six decades Cathy has spent photographing the world around her.

A regular contributor to travel blogs and Sunday newspapers, find out how Cathy's work transforms from the humble snaps on her Kodak Brownie 127 to the stunning images taken with her Canon EOS digital camera.

The free exhibition runs until the 28<sup>th</sup> May 2019.

Speaking ahead of the exhibition Cathy said:

> "Cameras have been part of my life for sixty years and my big professional break came in 2013, when I successfully entered wildlife images into the Noah's Art open exhibition at Orleans House Gallery.


> "I look forward to taking you on a retrospective tour through my life via all of the cameras I have used and cherished."
