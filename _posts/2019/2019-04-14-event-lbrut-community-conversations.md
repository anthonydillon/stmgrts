If you have something to say about where you live, come along to the latest round of Community Conversations kicking off this month.

Our ward events are a chance for ward councillors to hear what matters to you and share ideas about the future of your local area.

All events will begin at 6.30pm with a 30-minute exhibition where residents can put forward suggestions and comments around local priorities. This will be followed by a question time s style event hosted by an independent chair from the local area.

Attendees can pre-submit questions in advance via the Council's website.

It follows a successful first round of Community Conversations in 2018, attended by 594 people and watched by thousands of people online after the events.

Cllr Michael Wilson, Cabinet Member for Equality, Communities and the Voluntary Sector said:

> "This is a chance for residents to continue the dialogue with the Council established in the first round of conversations.

> "We are committed to being an open and listening Council and we want to hear from our residents about their ideas for their local area and issues affecting them and their communities.

> "This year will include discussion to inform priorities for the new Ward-based budgets, which aim to give the community greater ownership and influence over what is invested locally."
