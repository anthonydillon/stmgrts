We are grateful to Richmond Civic Pride and Heathrow Community Fund for funding which will allow us to work to encourage young people and families to get out and explore nature in spaces along the river Crane. The FORCE Family Challenge is a two year project to engage schools and families in the open spaces along the river Crane in Richmond upon Thames. FORCE is grateful to Richmond Civic Pride and the Heathrow Community Fund for their support of this project. We are working with two schools currently. Waldegrave School Six Form students will be joining in some of the community learning activities over the summer months getting their hand dirty and learning floral survey techniques with Paul Losse. We are also look forward to them joining in with TCV on some of the community learning activities

We have been working with St Stephens School in St Margarets on a project in partnership with the Friends of Moormead to raise awareness about the impact of rubbish in open spaces and in the park. A FORCE trustee spoke about the river and the impact that man has on the local environment at two assemblies for the infant school and the junior school.

The children were set the task of designing a poster to display in Moor Mead Park and other open spaces along the river. Six entries were chosen and put up in the park to encourage the proper use of rubbish bins and recycling of waste.

The posters indicate how strongly the children feel about the topic. Later in the summer a small team will take part in a litter picking activity in the park.
