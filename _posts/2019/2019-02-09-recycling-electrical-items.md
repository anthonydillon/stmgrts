Residents are encouraged to kick start 2019 by de-cluttering their old or broken electrical items.

Richmond Council and West London Waste Authority are hosting a recycling collection for old, small electronic equipment (WEEE).  From 11-15<sup>th</sup> February from 9am to 5pm at the Civic Centre in York Street, items can be donated.

The event provides local residents with the opportunity to de-clutter their homes of broken or unwanted small electrical items such as alarm clocks, toys, kettles, and hair dryers.

This follows the announcement at the end of last year that WEEE can also be donated at nine of the borough's libraries.

Cllr Martin Elengorn, Richmond Council Cabinet Member for Environment, said:

> "Any kind of electrical items that have batteries, a power plug or charger, or renewable power are welcome. Landfilling or incineration of waste and electrical equipment can be particularly dangerous as it contains hazardous substances such as mercury, lead, beryllium and cadmium. Recycling these items means fewer raw materials need to be used in the manufacture of new goods and precious metals are used again."


To find out more, or see the opening times for the libraries, go to: [www.richmond.gov.uk/libraries](http://www.richmond.gov.uk/libraries )or [www.richmond.gov.uk/dispose_of_electrical_items](http://www.richmond.gov.uk/dispose_of_electrical_items)

It's estimated that one million tonnes of electrical items are thrown away in the UK each year. This type of waste is considered hazardous and is growing three times faster than any other type of waste.

_Please note that if you are disposing of items which have personal data stored, it is your responsibility to delete this data before placing the item in the bin._
