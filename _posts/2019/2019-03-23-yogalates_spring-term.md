Beth's classes promote a safe and supportive environment for all ages and levels of ability, even beginners, to improve their health and wellbeing via the powerful and effective combination of Hatha Yoga and Pilates.  Current students have experienced relief from issues such as poor posture, back pain, stress and anxiety as a result of regular practice.  As one client says:

> "Since I going to Beth's Yogalates classes for over a year now I can feel the difference.  I am gaining flexibility, improving muscle strength and posture, acquiring more confidence and releasing pain caused by lower back problems"
