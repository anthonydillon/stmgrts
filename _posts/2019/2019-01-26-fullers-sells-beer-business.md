Fuller's announces that it has entered into an agreement for the sale of its entire beer business to Asahi Europe Ltd ("AEL"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Asahi Group Holdings, Ltd ("Asahi"), for an enterprise value of &pound;250 million on a debt free, cash free basis (the "Proposed Disposal").

The business being sold comprises the entirety of Fuller's beer, cider and soft drinks brewing and production, wine wholesaling, as well as the distribution thereof, and also includes the Griffin Brewery, Cornish Orchards, Dark Star Brewing and Nectar Imports (the "Fuller's Beer Business" or the "Beer Business").

Under the terms of the Proposed Disposal, AEL will acquire the brands of the Beer Business (including "London Pride") and will receive the benefit of a licence, on a perpetual, global, exclusive and royalty-free basis, to use certain trade marks (including the "Fuller's" name, logo and cartouche) for the provision of beverages. Ownership of the licensed trade marks will be retained by Fuller's.
