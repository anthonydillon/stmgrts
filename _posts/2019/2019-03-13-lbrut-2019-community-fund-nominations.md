Residents can now submit their proposals for new community projects as part of the  next round of the Community Fund.

The Community Fund comes from the Community Infrastructure Levy, a tax collected by Richmond upon Thames Council and paid by developers (15% or 25% in neighbourhood plan areas) A portion of the total tax collected will fund local priority projects which address the impact development has on an area.

This money might be used for a variety of projects, including; green space improvements, resources and equipment for community use or community centre renovations.

Any local resident, business or community group, living or operating within the borough can bring forward a proposal.

In the first two rounds of the Fund, 24 community projects from around the borough, ranging from a toy library scheme to sporting facilities and outdoor space refurbishments, were awarded a total of &pound;674,532

Wards in the borough have been grouped East and West of the River Thames, with Ham and Petersham being a separate area as it has adopted a Neighbourhood Plan. Each cluster has a Community Fund 'pot' collected from the developments that have taken place in each area.

The clusters are:

### East

- Mortlake and Barnes Common
- North Richmond
- South Richmond
- East Sheen
- Richmond Riverside

### West

- Whitton
- Heathfield
- West Twickenham
- Fulwell and Hampton Hill
- Teddington
- Hampton Wick
- Hampton
- Hampton North

All proposals should be for more than &pound;5,000 and must meet certain criteria.

Any groups or individuals who have ideas for projects can find out more information online and see if their project is eligible.  Further information and support on the application process is also available from your local Community Links Officers and Richmond Council for Voluntary Services (RCVS).

Cllr Michael Wilson, Richmond Council Cabinet Member for Equalities, Communities and the Voluntary Sector, said:

> "We know that residents have a strong vision for the future of their community. This fund will help make some of the community ideas and initiatives a reality.


> "I hope many more community organisations and local groups will get involved and work with Council officers and local ward councillors to bring forward strong project proposals for funding.


The deadline to submit your ideas is Friday 31<sup>st</sup> May
