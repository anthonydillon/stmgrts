*Exhibition ends 24 February 2019*

The Lost Treasures of Strawberry Hill exhibition ends of the 24<sup>th</sup> February 2019. We have welcomed over 10,000 people through our doors at Strawberry Hill House, and have received some fantastic press coverage and reviews, here are just a few:

> 'Strawberry Hill for ever' The Times

> 'A confection packed with curiosities' Financial Times

> 5 star review from Evening Standard

> 4 star review from The Guardian

This exhibition brings back to Strawberry Hill some of the most important masterpieces in Horace Walpole's famous and unique collection - one of the greatest in the 18<sup>th</sup> century. Dispersed in 1842 and scattered to the winds, over the past 3 years Strawberry Hill's Curators have been hunting down works using Walpole's detailed descriptions and the sales catalogue of 1842. For the first time in over 170 years, Strawberry Hill can be seen as Walpole conceived it, with the original collection in the interiors he designed for it.

Open 7 days a week, from the 20 October 2018 until 24 February 2019 offering tours, group tours and private hire. Don't miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to this 5-star exhibition, before it closes on the 24 February, and the collection is dispersed once again.
