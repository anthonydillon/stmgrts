An amended 20mph limit is set to be introduced in Richmond upon Thames, if the Council's Scrutiny Committee, followed by the Cabinet, agree to the amended proposals. This follows a 12-week consultation held last year.

While opinion was split among the nearly 10,000 respondents on whether to implement the council's 20mph proposal in its original form (47.9 per cent in favour and 49.7 per cent against), 52 per cent of respondents agreed that a 20mph limit should reduce the number and severity of road accidents.

The consultation also found that vulnerable road users were overwhelmingly supportive of the proposals with 65 per cent of under 19s and 60 per cent of over 75s supporting the proposals.

Commenting on the findings, Cllr Alexander Ehmann, Cabinet Member for Transport, Streetscene and Air Quality said:

> "A majority of residents acknowledged that a borough-wide 20mph limit would improve road safety, but a small number of these residents felt unable to lend our original proposal their unreserved support.


> "That is why we've spent time studying the consultation responses and have made meaningful changes to our proposals. Whether on enforcement, phased roll-out, evaluation, air quality or the exclusion of a number of roads, our amended proposal look to build further support around the areas raised via the Community Conversations and formal consultation process.


> "We have sought to build consensus by accommodating the most significant perceived drawbacks with our original proposal. However, residents have told us that they do see the road safety benefit of moving to 20mph on all our roads.


> "Our revised proposals were very much shaped by the views of our critics, but we also had to consider the impact on the youngest and eldest in our society who were roughly 2-1 in favour of a borough-wide 20mph limit.


> "The council's new proposal establishes a better balance that reflects the representations we received though a vibrant consultation process."


Will Norman, London's Walking and Cycling Commissioner, who is working to deliver the Mayor of London's pledge to make walking and cycling safer and easier in the Capital, supported the announcement. He added:

> "It is great to see Richmond Council looking to implement a 20mph scheme.


> "The roll-out of 20mph speed limits in the borough will reduce the danger for cyclists and pedestrians. That's an important part of putting people and not vehicles at the heart of our transport plans.


> "Making our streets more appealing for people walking and cycling brings health benefits to all Londoners, reduces congestion and helps tackle the toxic air crisis."


Taking the views of residents into account, the Council's amended proposal includes new changes, including:

- A revision of the proposed 20mph speed limit on the A308 between Kingston and Hampton, including Hampton Court Road, Upper Sunbury Road and Lower Sunbury Road (excluding Thames Street). The stretch (excluding Thames Street) will now be 30mph.
- Initial exclusion of the A310 between Kingston Bridge roundabout and Twickenham. This will be subject to a study aimed at introducing collision and speed reduction measures and will also determine whether to implement 20mph on the A310.
- Initial exclusion of part of the A305 between Apex Corner roundabout and Twickenham town centre.  This will also be subject to a study aimed at introducing collision and speed reduction measure and will determine whether to implement 20mph on this section of the A305.
The Council will also commission an independent air quality assessment around the scheme measuring key baseline readings around the likes of NO2 and PM10 emissions.

We are committed to reviewing the scheme after implementation and will look at additional enforcement measures as required and deemed appropriate. This could include further roll out of the successful Community Roadwatch programme as well as potential speed indicator devices.

If the decision is approved by the Cabinet a speed limit order will be advertised and any representations considered. [Read the full Cabinet Report](https://cabnet.richmond.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=776&MId=4624).
