Those looking to improve their skills and confidence on a bicycle will now be able to do so free of charge after Richmond Council announced the replacing of the &pound;10 training fee with a refundable deposit scheme.

This adds to the free Bikeability training already offered to around 2,500 year 6 children in the borough each year.

Courses are offered to anyone who lives, works or studies in the borough and cover three skills levels: basic skills, urban cycling skills and advanced cycling skills.

Cllr Alexander Ehmann, Cabinet Member for Transport, Streetscene and Air Quality said:

> "We want to make it as easy as possible for more of our residents to use sustainable modes of transport such as a cycling and removing this charge is an important part of doing that.


> "I am pleased that this administration's first budget since being elected reaffirms our commitment to making Richmond upon Thames a borough which supports active travel and creating an environment where our residents feel confident and safe enough to make their journeys by bicycle or on foot."


Cyclists wishing to take part in the course must have their own full roadworthy bike. Anyone under 16 should be accompanied by a responsible adult. The &pound;10 deposit will now be refunded upon attendance.
