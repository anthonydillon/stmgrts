It looks likely that over 200,000 people a year will use Twickenham Rough the newest green space in Twickenham which was formally opened in October by the Council and the developer St James.

It is situated next to the Brewery Wharf residential development opposite Twickenham Station. The footpath and cycleway starts behind the M Bar and Grill and extends to the Marsh Farm Lane footbridge by Craneford Playing Fields.

In the 1800s, the land was farmland and, following industrial development, it became sandwiched between the Old Sorting Office, the railway track and the River Crane, making it inaccessible to the public and it became overgrown.

When the Sorting Office was sold to St James for development it was agreed that Twickenham Rough would be transferred to the Council and become public amenity land. The Council is responsible for opening the gates at one end, with the developer holding responsibility for opening the gates at the other end.

Since it opened in October 2018, the Council, along with volunteers from Friends of the River Crane Environment (FORCE) have been working together to ensure that the new community asset is maintained and improved as a new link along the River Crane. And whilst it has only been opened for six months, a recent FORCE survey has shown that over 600 people are using the area every day - with this figure increasing every week. This could mean that over 200,000 people will travel through Twickenham Rough every year.

Cllr Martin Elengorn, Richmond Council Cabinet Member for Environment, said:

> "Since the Twickenham Rough opened to the public, more and more people have started using it as a route home, to school or college or work. This tranquil route provides respite for many pedestrians and cyclists, and I hope that many more will enjoy the natural green space."
