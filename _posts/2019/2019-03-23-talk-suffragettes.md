Suffragettes, Suffragists and Antis is the subject of Hounslow and District History Society's next meeting on Tuesday 26 March 2019 at the United Reformed Church Hall, Chapel Road, Hounslow, TW3 1UL commencing at 7.45pm. The lecturer is Mrs Irene Cockcroft, authoress and lecturer specialising in women's involvement in the Arts and Crafts and Suffragette movements.

Mrs Cockcroft will explain that many men sympathised with women's legal predicament and endured social ostracism to change unjust laws. Women were not enfranchised on equal terms with men until 1928. In 1919 the Sex Discrimination (Removal) Act made is possible for women to train in professions such as the law. Oxford degrees were not awarded to women until 1920 and Cambridge even later in 1948.

Many consider that more progress still needs to be made in breaking through the glass ceiling so the step-by-step approach will be fascinating, following the journey from the 19<sup>th</sup> century.

Non-members of the History Society are welcome with an entrance fee of &pound;2.00 per head to include tea or coffee and biscuits.
