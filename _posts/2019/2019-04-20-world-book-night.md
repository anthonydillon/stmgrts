How will you be spending World Book Night on 23 April? Richmond Libraries will be celebrating it the same way they have done for the last five years - by donating books to readers around the borough who may not have easy access to them.

World Book Night is a national celebration of reading where books are given out across the UK with a focus on reaching those who don't regularly read. Books are gifted through organisations including prisons, libraries, colleges, hospitals, care homes and homeless shelters, as well as by passionate individuals who give out their own books within their communities.

The Libraries team in Richmond upon Thames will be sharing the joy of reading by donating over sixty books to people who don't regularly read across the Richmond, Twickenham and Teddington areas. Many of these will be donated in partnership with other organisations such as SPEAR, the charity supporting people suffering from homelessness.

Cllr John Coombs, Richmond Council Cabinet Member for Arts, Culture and Sport said:

> "World Book Night is all about celebrating reading and encouraging people who don't regularly read to pick up a book by donating to hard to reach areas such as hospitals, care homes and homeless shelters.


> "Our library service will once again be donating a range of books to those places around the borough where people may not have the opportunity to regularly read.


> "I would encourage people who may have spare books lying around the house to check the World Book Night website at [www.worldbooknight.org](http://www.worldbooknight.org )for how you can donate them."
