Green fingered residents are being encouraged to take advantage of another compost giveaway.

This Sunday (14<sup>th</sup> April), Richmond Council, along with West London Waste Authority and Veolia, will be hosting a 'Compost Giveaway' day from 11.00am until 3pm, or when compost runs out, at Holly Road car park, Twickenham.

There will be 10 tonnes of compost to give away, with residents being able to take home two bags of compost per household for free. Residents collecting compost are also encouraged to bring along any small waste electrical items they no longer need as these will be collected for recycling at the same time.

Any leftover compost will be given away at the Richmond May Fair on 11<sup>th</sup> May.

Cllr Martin Elengorn, Cabinet Member for Environment, Planning and Sustainability said:

> "This is another chance for environmentally responsible residents to collect some free compost and bring their unwanted or broken small electrical items for recycling at the same time.


> "The Council's waste and recycling team, Veolia and the West London Waste Authority will be also on hand to provide general waste and recycling advice along with information about home composting and the Council's garden waste service."
