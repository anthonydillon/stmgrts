Sunday 28<sup>th</sup> April 2019, 10am - 3pm at Kilmorey Mausoleum wildlife garden,

After the huge success of last year's Plant Sale, Environment Trust is running its second Plant Sale and combining it with an Open Day at the Grade II listed Kilmorey Mausoleum in St Margarets on [28<sup>th</sup> April 2019](https://stmargarets.london/event/event/200705147001).

With a great selection of plants for sale, free tours of the beautiful mausoleum, local beekeepers as well as plenty of delicious homemade cakes, there will be something for all the family to enjoy.

Rich in history, the mausoleum was built by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Earl of Kilmorey in 1854 in memory of his mistress and life partner, Priscilla.  He moved it with his household several times before landing at Gordon House in Twickenham.

Wild animals and plants have been losing their homes over the last 50 years. Over half of UK species have declined over the last 50 years (State of Nature report, 2013) - so it's very important to look after them. Many of the most beautiful garden plants are attractive to wildlife and any garden, however small, can be turned into a sanctuary for wildlife.

At the event, a wide range of plants which encourage and sustain local wildlife including annuals, biennials, perennials, herbs and many more will be on sale. The plants will be suitable for both huge gardens and tiny outside spaces.

Local beekeepers will be at the event with their hives to talk about beekeeping and plants that are great for attracting bees. The first 50 visitors will get a free pack of 'bee-friendly wildflower seeds'.

Berny Simcox, CEO of Environment Trust says;

> "This will be a wonderful day out for the whole family. It's a rare chance to explore the wildlife garden and have a look inside the mausoleum where the Trust's volunteers will be giving fascinating tours, as well as buy plants to create their own garden to attract local wildlife."

> "Part of our fundraising strategy is to put on a variety of events throughout the year that will raise money for the Trust and engage local people to awaken their curiosity in unexpected ways."


The entrance fee is &pound;3 (kids go free) which includes tea and coffee, a tour of the mausoleum and the wildlife garden. There is unrestricted parking in the area all day and all proceeds will support Environment Trust's nature and heritage conservation work.
