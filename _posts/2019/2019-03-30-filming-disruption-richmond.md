Large scale filming of Peter Rabbit Two will be taking place in Richmond Town Centre for six days from 31 March to 7 April 2019.

#### Locations

Throughout this time, filming will be based in a number of locations, including Richmond Riverside, the Richmond Green area, and Whittaker Avenue.

#### Disruption

Over the past few months our Filming Officers have been working with the production company to ensure that the impact on local residents, visitors to the town centre and local businesses is minimised as much as possible.

Regular meetings have been held with local ward councillors and other local groups, to ensure that all are informed of the filming.

Letters from the production company have been sent to all local residents and businesses in the impacted area.

#### Charges to the production company

We are charging the production company to film in the borough, along with subsequent charges for parking/road closures etc. This money will be reinvested into local services.

In addition, the production company are making significant donations to local organisations to help fund local projects e.g. improvements to enhance the grass area on Hill Rise, restoration of a fountain on Richmond Green, and a contribution so the local police are able to put on events to alert people to the dangers of scams.
