In Her Majesty's first official visit to the borough in 23 years, The Queen will attend the specially commissioned community festival 'Wild London' in Richmond Park on 15 May 2012.  Richmond Council and The Royal Parks have teamed up to host this special event which will pay tribute to The Queen's six decades on the throne and celebrate both London's natural environment and the important role that the borough's parks and gardens play in bringing people closer to nature.

The event is made up of three main zones - the Recreation zone, the Conservation zone and the Inspiration zone.  Each zone will have stalls from a variety of organisations who will be providing interactive activities, demonstrations and performances.  These organisations represent the wide range of culture, sport and nature that the borough has to offer to visitors and residents. Find out more about "who is attending":http://www.richmond.gov.uk/home/leisure_and_culture/diamond_jubilee/stallholders.htm and "how to get to the event":http://www.richmond.gov.uk/home/leisure_and_culture/diamond_jubilee/how_to_get_to_the_event.htm.

The public festival will be held on the sports pitches between the Sheen Gate and the Roehampton Gate, starting at 11.00am. For those wanting to get a glimpse of The Queen on her drive into the park, she will be arriving at Richmond Park's Sheen Gate in the early afternoon. Exact timings will be announced the day before the visit.
