John Armstrong died recently, and his memorial service was held at St Mary's Church, Church Street, Twickenham, on Monday 4 March. John chaired the inward investment group of the Twickenham Town Centre Management Board and was active in getting new specialised businesses into the town, including Laverstoke Park butchers and the new Ruben's bakery. He was also a boatbuilder and designer - his company, Thanetcraft, designed and built the Hammerton's ferryboat, Peace of Mind. For many years he was on the committee of the York House Society, and his energy and commitment are much missed.
