On the 16<sup>th</sup> February 2007 the Richmond Council Planning Committee refused permission for a proposed "hand car wash":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2007/01/planning_permis.html to be located near the Book Data building on the A316.

The refusal was for five planning reasons:

# detrimental impact on the open character of the land
# traffic impact
# no flood risk assessment
# no groundwater and pollution protection plan
# no local wildlife impact assessment

For all the details, read the Committee's letter <a href="//stmgrts.org.uk/assets/images/2007/refused_car_wash.pdf">here (PDF)</a>.
