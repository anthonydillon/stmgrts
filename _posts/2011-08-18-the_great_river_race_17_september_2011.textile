h4. THE COURSE - 2011

# 13:40 - *MILLWALL DOCK SLIPWAY - LONDON DOCKLANDS*
Our starter fires the maroon to start the first of the 300-odd entrants. Boats leave on a 'slowest first, fastest last' handicap basis, giving all crews an equal chance.
# 14:10 - *TOWER BRIDGE*
Not long after passing Canary Wharf, the unmistakable outline of Tower Bridge comes into sight. The Bridge is a great favourite with spectators who love to line the rails to watch the crews fighting for position as they approach.
# 14:25 - *WESTMINSTER BRIDGE*
Tricky currents give crews, especially novices, a tough challenge as some fight to hold on to their handicap advantage, while others try to weave their way through. Great racing for the crowds as the competition hots up.
# 14:30 - *LAMBETH BRIDGE*
The leading boats are now passing the Houses of Parliament and concentrating on the long haul upriver. Back at Millwall there are still more than one hundred boats yet to start.
# 14:45 - *BATTERSEA BRIDGE*
Approaching the halfway point and the crews have now received maximum assistance from the incoming tide. The riverside promenades above and below the Bridge make excellent vantage points.
# 14:55 - *WANDSWORTH BRIDGE*
While the best crews in the slower boats are still leading the field, the more powerful crews in the faster craft are now showing their speed as they move through the field.
# 15:00 - *PUTNEY BRIDGE*
While the head of the Race is now two thirds of the way home, the end of the fleet has just cleared central London.
# 15:15 - *HAMMERSMITH BRIDGE*
Tricky currents around the Dove Pier just above the Bridge will test tiring crews and weary coxes.
# 15:45 - *CHISWICK BRIDGE*
With around an hour to go, speculation mounts as to whether those low-handicap boats which have led the fleet for so long will be able to hold on to their advantage or be overwhelmed.
# 16:00 - *KEW BRIDGE*
Now racing a against a semi-rural backdrop, the faster dragonboats, Waterman Cutters, Pilot Gigs and Celtic Longboats are beginning to show their superior pace and feature in the top twenty.
# 16:30 - *RICHMOND BRIDGE*
Richmond's riverside spectators cheer on the crews as they pass through the Bridge. With 35 trophies up for grabs, crews must draw on their last reserves to vie for a winning spot.
# 16:40 - *RIVERSIDE BELOW HAM HOUSE, RICHMOND*
Our Race winner crosses the line to a cannon broadside, rousing applause, and the prospect of receiving _The Challenge Trophy of The Company of Watermen & Lightermen_ and becoming the UK Traditional Boat Champions in the process.
