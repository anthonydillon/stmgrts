Some 120 parents, friends and hangers-on threatened to overflow the Drama Studio for one of OPSA's busiest quiz nights in recent years. John Hutchings as ever came up with the most intelligent quiz in the area, and again was in fine voice with his final round of musical memories. Our thanks to OPSA for organisational skills, and to all who came out on a cold night (perhaps the alternative of a night of Pudsey Bear on the telly was less appealing!).
