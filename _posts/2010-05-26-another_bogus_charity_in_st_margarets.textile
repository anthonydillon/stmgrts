W&W Help Limited are collecting in St Margarets on Thursday. W&W Help Limited claim to support a breast cancer prevention programme to the tune of &pound;1,500 per month. There is no mention of a specific programme or project.

The Government Charity Commission website has no record of W&W Help.  The company registration number 6296698 on the leaflet does check out on the Companies House website.  W&W Help was dissolved in March 2009.

Please please do not support these people by leaving your unwanted items on the
doorstep.
