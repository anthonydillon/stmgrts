The Teddington Tigers, an over 40's men's hockey side and part of Teddington Hockey Club, are looking to get some new members. They play every two weeks over the winter and are a very friendly and gentlemanly team!  The hockey is of a reasonable standard and not too demanding and there's a really good bunch of members.

So if anyone fancies a run around, we are really keen to recruit new players for the forthcoming season.  Contact Richard Roberts at "richard@rglroberts.com":mailto:richard@rglroberts.com or phone 07917020737
