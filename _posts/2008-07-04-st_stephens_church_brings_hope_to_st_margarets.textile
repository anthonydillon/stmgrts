St Stephen's Church will be reaching out, further into the community, for a fortnight of social action and prayer in and around St Margaret's from Sunday 29th June to 13th July. They have organised many projects from cleaning gardens to painting Marble Hill Park's fence, visiting house bound people to quenching the thirst of commuters!

The fortnight will be focussed around 'Social Action Sunday' on the 6th July but the events and projects will run throughout. It will all culminate in Marble Hill Park on Sunday 13th July where they will host a Fun day with Face painting, inflatable obstacle courses, magicians and much much more!

And why? St Stephen's wants to be a blessing to the community and to demonstrate the Good News of God's love to all people.

No strings, no nonsense, display of love to all!
