We are pleased to announce that this year Richmond Rink is moving to the beautiful setting of Strawberry Hill House.  We will be able to provide more facilities, with a slightly larger rink, and with the wonderful backdrop of the house's white turrets and stained glass windows.

Details of the planning application can be seen via the link below and we would welcome any comments submitted in support of our application, which can be submitted online:

"Planning Application No.: 14/3393":http://www2.richmond.gov.uk/PlanData2/Planning_CaseNo.aspx?strCASENO=14/3393/FUL

We look forward to welcoming you on the ice this winter!
