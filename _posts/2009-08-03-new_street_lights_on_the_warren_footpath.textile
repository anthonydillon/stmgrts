Work will start on Tuesday 28<sup>th</sup> July starting at the Richmond Bridge end working towards Orleans Road. During the time of installation, trenching and removal work, sections of the footpath will be closed. The closures are planned to take place on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays for 10 weeks between the hours of 9 am and 5 pm. Some sections of the footpath will always remain open but you may have to divert fairly far off the river footpath to pass the closed works areas depending on the location of the works. On closure days you can divert by using the Surrey towpath between Richmond Bridge and Ham House and take Hammerton's ferry to cross. The ferry will be free for pedestrians and cyclists on the closure days and operate from 9 am to 6 pm for the 10 weeks of works (Tuesday, Wednesdays and Thursdays).

All lights will have a white light fixture with no UV which are better for human face recognition as well as better for wildlife and "particularly for bats":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2009/03/new_batfriendly_lights_proposed_for_the_warren_foo.html . The cost of the project is being paid for via the Thames Landscape Strategy London's Arcadia programme with grants from private trusts including BIFFAWARD, the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Father Thames Trust.
