The _St Margarets Community Website_ created a Treasure Hunt for  "Christmas in St Margarets":/archives/2005/11/christmas_shopp.html.  The hunt was a short, visual romp around Crown and St Margarets Road for little kids.  The very real and famous pirate, Dead Eye Charlie, was walking the streets with his pal, a  balloon modeller.  And Santa was once again in his grotto, to the delight of many children.

<div class="letter">Finally, Santa's grotto is for sale AND immediately available.  If you are interested in buying the shed for anything over {-L}200, please contact Simon Chapman at Cutters.  Proceeds benefit local schools.</div>
