Beginner and intermediate Pilates classes are starting in St Margarets on Thursday evenings after Easter.

The classes are a great way to tone up and improve your posture through a series of relaxing exercises. The beginners classes are between 7.30 and 8.20 and the intermediate classes are between 8.30 and 9.20. Eight sessions are &pound;60.

Alternatively, if you prefer one-to-one tuition, you can choose home personal Pilates training.
