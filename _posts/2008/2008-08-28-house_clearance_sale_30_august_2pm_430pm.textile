Well I'm gonna go and do it -- live abroad for a while that is. So my home will become someone else's and I need to shift some stuff. Nothing too exciting but there might be a bargain or two that could be useful to you.

Please come along this Saturday, 30 August from 2pm - 4:30pm and save me from the car bootie option!

Items will include:

* Books
* Toys
* Children's clothing
* Kitchens utensils
* Faux fur throws
* Beautiful Tapestry wall hanging
* Christmas decorations
* A box of items for no cost
* Vases

Come along to 39 Godstone Road and grab a bargain

_p.s. please bring change._
