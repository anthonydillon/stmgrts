Two councillors have challenged Cllr David Trigg's [recent decision](http://tinyurl.com/6awrsl) by 'calling it in' for review: Cllrs Head \[S Twickenham\] and Hodgins \[Barnes\] write

> "a) the due processes and consultations were flawed, b) the review in 6 months time \[should\] be open to all the residents who were originally consulted; and that the extent of consultation should not be circumscribed by local councillors and the Transport Consultative Group."

The Council website says: [The decision is currently being reconsidered](http://tinyurl.com/5snk3d)
