We have just finished an extensive refurbishment and we have invited Vincent Cable, our local MP to officially reopen the pub on Friday 26th September. Mr Cable will cut the ribbon at approximately 4.00pm. Please accept our invitation to come along and meet us and have a look at the changes we've made.

Friday afternoon will be by invitation only -- "download an invitation":http://www.risingsuntwickenham.co.uk/launch_invite.pdf.  Please print it out and bring it along.
