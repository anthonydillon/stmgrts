[The Rising Sun](https://stmargarets.london/directory/pub/200611051507) reopens this Friday - new coat of paint, new landlord, stuffed camels in storage but otherwise the same.

Coincidentally a neighbour pointed out to Pete the landlord at the Crown that their music licence only covered Thursdays through Saturday so as of this Monday 23rd June we are back at the Rising Sun starting soon after 8.00. (Leaving time to blow the plaster dust out of the piano).

[The Jazz Showcase's](https://stmargarets.london/directory/music/200802050818) house band as always will be Ian Anderson on piano, Jeremy Holroyd on drums and Roger Perrin on double bass.

As a special treat we hope to have Sarah Ellen Hughes singing with us this Monday.

Sarah has been the principal singer with the National Youth Jazz Orchestra for the last three years and has appeared with NYJO at the Pizza Express Dean Street, Ronnie Scotts and The Stables at Wavendon and now has a residency at Pizza on the Park on the first Wednesday of each month.

Admission is free
