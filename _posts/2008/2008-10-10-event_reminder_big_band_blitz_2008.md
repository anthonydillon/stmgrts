Step back in time, return to the 1940s and dance the night away at [Big Band Blitz](/event/show/200705141991). This popular and highly successful annual 1940s event will this year celebrate the 20th Anniversary of the opening of The Museum of Richmond by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.

Proceeds from this special charity event will help benefit The Museum of Richmond's charity. Royal Patron of the charity is HRH Princess Alexandra, and the Patrons include Richmond's famous brothers, Lord Richard Attenborough and Sir David Attenborough.

Big Band Blitz re-creates a 1940s WWII Glenn Miller night of entertainment, featuring the Jon Bennett Big Band playing the music of Glenn Miller and other big bands from the 1940s, plus special guests from the world of entertainment. There will be 1940s period dress and memorabilia, food and drink from the NAAFI, licensed bar, the Air-Raid Warning, a celebrity raffle, plus a few surprises.

The Jon Bennett Big Band has appeared in the West End at the Lyceum and Dominion Theatres, the Savoy Hotel, the Australian High Commission, and the Royal Gala Performance, Night of Nights, at Richmond Theatre. Jon Bennett has been musical director for a number of charity gala shows, and has worked with a number of performers including Bonnie Langford, Clive Rowe, Peter Straker, and the late Roy Castle.

Among the special showbiz guests appearing will be the welcome return of Australian diva, Kathleen McCormack, who has 28 albums to her credit, including a gold award, and numerous concert appearances including Sydney Opera House, and her own radio and television shows. Also making a welcome return will be Tom Nolan as George Formby, and comedian Iain Dawson as Viv the Spiv. This year a new talented singer from Canada will be featured, Vanessa Lanch, and making his first appearance at Big Band Blitz will be actor / singer, Jack Pinder. Another special guest, making a rare big band appearance singing the standards will be rock legend Pete French of Atomic Rooster, Cactus and LeafHound fame (Pete's vocals are featured in the hit television series Life on Mars, and in the recent movie Breakfast on Pluto), and to help with the celebrity raffle draw will be TV presenter Mark Curry, assisted by three members of the original 1960's London Palladium Tiller Girls, plus a few surprises!
