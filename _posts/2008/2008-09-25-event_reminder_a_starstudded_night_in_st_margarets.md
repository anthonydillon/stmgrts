[A great night of music](https://stmargarets.london/cgi-bin/events.cgi?key=200705141943) is planned for Friday, 3<sup>rd</sup> October, at The Turks Head Winchester Hall; all in aid of a great local charity, *The Shooting Star Children's Hospice*. It is the third such event and sees a terrific mix of bands playing during the evening. Headlining are The **Soul Agents**, who play irresistible authentic 60's soul and are guaranteed to get the crowd dancing. They will be supported by *The BlueBeat Allstars* who are well known in the area for their irresistible Ska rhythms and were seen most recently at the St Margarets Fair. If that's not enough two talented young bands, **Stranger's Gallery** and **Bad Taste** will also perform!

You just make a contribution at the door and all the money raised goes direct to the charity who now need over Â£2,000,000 a year just to keep going. They rely purely on donations. Doors Open at 7.30. Don't miss a great night out for a good cause!
