Friend of this site, Ed Randall was recently featured as _thelondonpaper_'s "Picture of the day":http://www.thelondonpaper.com/cs/Satellite/london/talk?packedargs=categoryId%3D1154364219957 with a funny reminder of the dangers of parking near the Thames.

Be sure to see Ed's winning entry before it is archived off the site.
