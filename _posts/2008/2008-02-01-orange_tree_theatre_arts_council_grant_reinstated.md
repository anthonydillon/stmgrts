The Orange Tree Theatre is delighted to announce that its Arts Council grant has been reinstated, having been under the threat of a 17 % cut. This decision is a reflection of the Arts Council's belief in the quality and importance of the Orange Tree's work and recognition of its significant London-wide reputation. The Orange Tree is London's only theatre permanent theatre in the round and its commitment to unearthing forgotten classics gives it a national significance. Without full funding the Orange Tree would be unable to continue with its unique programme of work as well as its many education and outreach projects, and so it is with relief that we learn that the Arts Councils' full support will continue.
