Veta Louise and her daughter Myrtle Mae have arranged an afternoon party -- hoping to find an an ideal husband for Myrtle. But things go horribly wrong when Uncle Elwood P Dowd drops in with his best friend Harvey -- a 6' 1" white rabbit invisible to everyone else.

And as their party plans go progressively down the rabbit hole, the baffled family resolves to commit Uncle Elwood to the local mental hospital.

Come to the Richmond Shakespeare Society's Mary Wallace Theatre, Twickenham for a madcap masterpiece of merriment and mayhem as Elwood and his bunny chum dispel the despair of the credit crunch in this beautifully written play by Mary Chase.

*And, on the way, teach us a thing or two about Life...*

Director John Gilbert says: "The play works best in the period in which it's written, so we're conjuring up a world that hints at but doesn't precisely copy late 1940s America, with references to the film culture so vital at that time.To do this we're working with students from the London College of Fashion on some marvellous makeup to go with the wonderful costumes.

> "In 1950 Harvey became a memorable film starring James Stewart. As Elwood shares his ... well, idiosyncratic outlook, its Pulitzer Prize credentials still sparkle through just as superbly. We expect it to become this year's top pre-Christmas present, and given its likely popularity, we'll be performing 10 shows rather than our usual eight."
