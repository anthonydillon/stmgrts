After Beijing, the gold rush continues. An independent, south-west London cheese retailer, _yellowwedge cheese_, in St Margarets, Twickenham, has won the prestigious trophy for Best New Deli at the British Cheese Awards 2008.

*The Best New Deli* award, sponsored by _SpecialityFood Magazine_, presented to _yellowwedge cheese_ at the _British Cheese Awards 2008_ on Friday 26 September at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, aims to celebrate and recognise new independent cheese retailers promoting a fantastic range of artisan British cheeses with flair and passion.


_yellowwedge cheese_ opened its doors in November 2007, specialising in offering customers a comprehensive and exciting range of British cheese, ranging from Appleby's Cheshire to Alex James' (previously of BLUR) Little Wallop, (see Alex James's journey from music to cheese) via more local produce including Wigmore, Waterloo and Barkham Blue, as well as other exceptional cheeses from across Europe. David Harries, founder, proprietor and general Big Cheese, commented:

bq. "We are absolutely delighted to have won this prestigious award and want to thank our customers in the local community for their overwhelming support. I have fond memories of growing up on a variety of cheeses from an early age, always interested in trying something new and different. It was the age of Monty Python and I can still recite all the names of the cheeses mentioned in the 'cheese shop' sketch (even believing there was such a cheese as Venezuelan Beaver Cheese!). In an increasingly food-conscious world, my philosophy has always been to put the fun and passion back into selling high-quality cheeses to our discerning local community and beyond."

The yellowwedge team are always happy to advise customers and, while they can wax lyrical about all the cheeses, there is no substitute for trying for yourself - so a range of tasting samples are always available, and customers are always welcome to try before they buy. For that special party or event, yellowwedge can offer advice and prepare the ideal cheeseboard, or providing a Wedding or Birthday Cheese 'Cake'. Large events are also catered for, a recent example being cheeseboards for 150 guests at a local school's evening for prospective parents.

And it doesn't stop at cheese! A wide range of fine wines, dessert and port wines, cheese accompaniments such as pickles, chutneys, jellies, tracklments, crackers and oils are stocked, as well as elegant olive wood and slate cheeseboards and cheese knives. Exciting ideas are in the pipeline for Christmas, including a range of affordable and stylish 'cheesy' gifts, Christmas Cheese Cakes, and a fantastic range of high-quality palate pleasing goodies.
