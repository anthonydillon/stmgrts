If you recall, in the article "Pictures for Frances":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2008/02/pictures_for_frances.html, we asked readers to submit photos for a former resident of St Margarets who longs for news and images of St Margarets.  We have had two great submissions:

* Christopher Squire left a comment about the "Geograph website":http://www.geograph.org.uk/search.php?i=2229894
* Bob Goran loaded many area photos onto "Flickr":http://www.flickr.com/photos/bobandnicole/sets/72157603902384309/
* We have also posted a few "here":http://picasaweb.google.com/StMargaretsCommunityWebsite

Check them out and if you have more, either email us at "content@stmgrts.org.uk":mailto:content@stmgrts.org.uk or add them to a free "flickr":http://www.flickr.com/ account and tag the photos "stmgrts":http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=stmgrts&m=tags.
