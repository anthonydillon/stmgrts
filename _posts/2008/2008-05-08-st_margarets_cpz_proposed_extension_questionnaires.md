This week, all residents and businesses in proposed CPZ Zone S extension area for St Margarets should have received their questionnaires from Richmond Council. The closing date for the return of questionnaires and any representations is Friday the 23<sup>rd</sup> May 2008.

Here are some [notes from the Council's website](http://richmond.gov.uk/home/transport_and_streets/motor_vehicles_roads_and_parking/parking/controlled_parking_zones/controlled_parking_zone_consultations/st_margarets_cpz_consultation.htm)

#### What happens after the consultation

> Further to the consultation undertaken in May / June 2007 seeking views on the introduction of a Controlled Parking Zone (CPZ) in your area, the results showed support in a number of roads in St Margarets.
>
> The consultation results were presented to the Transport Consultative Group (TCG) on 18 July 2007. The recommendation was that proposals for a CPZ operational between 10am and 4.30pm on Monday to Friday be formally advertised.
> After further consideration of the results of the first stage consultation:

-   It is proposed to introduce a CPZ in the area of St Margarets as shown in green and white on the map on the front of this consultation document
-   The CPZ will be in the form of an extension to the existing St Margarets South controlled parking zone (zone S)
-   This zone currently operates between 10am and 4.30pm, Monday to Friday
