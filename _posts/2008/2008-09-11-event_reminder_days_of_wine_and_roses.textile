Next up from the Richmond Shakespeare Society is Owen McCafferty's poignant love story "Days of Wine and Roses":http://stmgrts.org.uk/event/play/200705141906, on stage at Twickenham's Mary Wallace Theatre from September 13 to 20.

Originally a 1958 teleplay written by a Texan which transferred to the big screen with Jack Lemmon and Lee Remick,it was reset for the stage by Northern Irish writer Owen McCafferty and relocated to London in the Swinging Sixties.

Two people, Donal and Mona, meet for the first time at Belfast Airport in 1962, awaiting their delayed flight as they move to live in London. Donal is a bookie's clerk, Mona a civil servant with a sheltered family life, but after one drink she begins to change -- and many more drinks follow.

Gradually their marriage turns to dust as Mona is drawn deeper and deeper into alcoholism -- until finally Donal resolves to return to Belfast, the city of his birth, taking little Kieran with him.

Director and Swan Award winner Chris Hurles says: "Nikki Squire and Kevin Boland put their hearts and souls into the demanding roles of Donal and Mona. As strangers in a strange city, they fall in love with life and each other -- but as alcohol takes its grip, their lives increasingly spiral out of control.

"It is a very powerful play with adult themes and graphic scenes, so it's not really suitable for children."

Performances run from Saturday September 13 at 7.45pm, with Sunday's show a 4pm matinee and no Wednesday show. Tickets &pound;8 or &pound;10.
