    #### How to improve fitness levels.
    
    # Look at a building a race into your training programme as this will keep you motivated.
    # If you have limited time to train, try a circuit session. Warm up and then compete the following:
    ** 10 fast squats
    ** 20 alternate lunges
    ** 10 press ups
    ** Run for 90 seconds
    ** 20 sit ups
    ** 20 low squats
    ** 15 tricep dips
    ** Run 90 seconds
    ** 15 squat thrusts with jump
    ** 10 alternate lunges
    ** Plank held for 30 seconds
    ** Repeat and then cool down.
    # To improve your fitness levels include speed work or a tempo session in your workout. Always warm up and cool down. For the speed session, increase your speed for a short distance and then run easily a similar distance. For the tempo session increase your pace so it is comfortably hard for 4-15 minutes depending on your fitness levels. Run easily for 2-5 minutes and then repeat.
    # Include a strength training session in your programme. This will help to prevent injuries. Include squats, lunges, single leg squats, press ups and stomach exercises in your regime.
