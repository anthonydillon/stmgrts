    <a href="https://stmargarets.london/directory/wine_aNd_spirits/200511281416">The Good Wine Shop</a> is an Independent Wine Merchant based in St Margarets, south west London. Since 1999 we have built a reputation locally for sourcing interesting, good value and often quirky wines from some of the worlds best small producers. Big high street brands and supermarket wines aren't really our thing, however that doesn't mean we only sell expensive wine.

[The Good Wine Shop](https://stmargarets.london/directory/wine_aNd_spirits/200511281416) is an Independent Wine Merchant based in St Margarets, south west London. Since 1999 we have built a reputation locally for sourcing interesting, good value and often quirky wines from some of the worlds best small producers. Big high street brands and supermarket wines aren't really our thing, however that doesn't mean we only sell expensive wine. There are wines in our range for all budgets but quality is never sacrificed.

Having managed to successfully establish our business locally we wanted to spread our wings onto the internet and see if wine lovers further a field would respond as well to the range of wines as our local customers do. We personally select all of the wines offered, a number of which we ship direct from the cellar door in Europe. Our aim is to offer the same service and personal touch to a wider audience in the UK via the internet.

Have a browse through our collection of Christmas cases & wines or simply use our wine search to narrow the options. We're sure you'll be able to find something that hits the spot!
