The [Book Now Literature Festival](http://www.richmond.gov.uk/home/leisure_and_culture/arts/book_now_literature_festival.htm) is celebrating its seventeenth anniversary this year from 1 to 25 November with events nearly every day..

> Joining us are biographers, novelists and leading figures from film, theatre and politics. Together with celebrated writers of science and philosophy, an adventurer and a poet, there is something to appeal to all.
> 
>  There is a focus on extraordinary lives: whether it's the writers' own lives or their subjects', the true-life stories that are revealed are remarkable and inspirational; and two anniversaries will be celebrated: the 30th birthday of Virago Books and the 400th anniversary of Milton's birth.
> 
 Most of the events are listed on [this site](/directory/art/200610191449), but check the [official site](http://www.richmond.gov.uk/literature) for any late changes and tickets.
