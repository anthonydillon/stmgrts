This May bank holiday the villagers of Petersham will be "throwing open their gardens to the public to help raise money for the Petersham Trust":http://stmargarets.london/event/tour/200705141810. Ten gardens will be included in the ticket price of &pound;10 per adult or &pound; 20 per family - under 16s are free.

With gardens ranging from the grand and elaborate to classic cottage gardens, there is a wealth of variety, size, style and design to enjoy, together with an abundance of plants and flowers on display. Delicious home made cakes and teas will be served at the Village Hall in Bute Avenue, and face painting will be available to keep the little ones amused.

The gardens, all privately owned, are spread around Petersham and are all within ten minutes walking distance of the Richmond Park Petersham Gate entrance opposite The Dysart Arms. Buses 65 and 371 stop. Directions will be displayed throughout the village.

This is the third time that this highly successful venture is being held. The money is raised for The Petersham Trust, a charitable foundation whose aims are to maintain the famous view from Richmond Hill over Petersham meadows by conserving and protecting the water meadows and maintaining the herd of cows grazing on the land.

Thanks to past donations, the Trust has been able to complete works to the infrastructure of the meadows by refurbishing the Victorian milking parlour, building a new barn for the cows and erecting a new rustic fence around the perimeter.
