    We're always looking for ways to improve the Fair and so we took on board many of the comments you made in the survey we ran after last year's Fair.  We're repeating the exercise again this year, and so before your memory of this year's Fair is dimmed, we'd really appreciate you taking a few minutes to answer the ten questions that can be found by "following this link":http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=DGwu2N_2bxhv_2fJhi6JZTyNbw_3d_3d. And don't forget you can now contact us all the year round and keep up to date with Fair news at "www.stmargaretsfair.org":http://www.stmargaretsfair.org/
    
    Thanks for your continuing help and support for the largest annual St Margarets community event.
