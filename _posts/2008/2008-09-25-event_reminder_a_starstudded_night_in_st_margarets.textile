"A great night of music":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/cgi-bin/events.cgi?key=200705141943 is planned for Friday, 3<sup>rd</sup> October, at The Turks Head Winchester Hall; all in aid of a great local charity, _The Shooting Star Children's Hospice_. It is the third such event and sees a terrific mix of bands playing during the evening. Headlining are The *Soul Agents*, who play irresistible authentic 60's soul and are guaranteed to get the crowd dancing. They will be supported by _The BlueBeat Allstars_ who are well known in the area for their irresistible Ska rhythms and were seen most recently at the St Margarets Fair. If that's not enough two talented young bands, *Stranger's Gallery* and *Bad Taste* will also perform!

You just make a contribution at the door and all the money raised goes direct to the charity who now need over &pound;2,000,000 a year just to keep going. They rely purely on donations. Doors Open at 7.30. Don't miss a great night out for a good cause!
