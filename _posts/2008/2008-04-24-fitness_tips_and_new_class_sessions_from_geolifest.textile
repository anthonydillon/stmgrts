    # Always warm up for about 5 minutes before you do any exercise. If you are going out running, start off by walking so you get yourself ready for your run. Stretching is not necessary before a run, but will help reduce muscle soreness at the end of your exercise session. Again cool down for about 5 minutes.

h4. How to improve fitness levels.

# Always warm up for about 5 minutes before you do any exercise. If you are going out running, start off by walking so you get yourself ready for your run. Stretching is not necessary before a run, but will help reduce muscle soreness at the end of your exercise session. Again cool down for about 5 minutes.
# Avoid running the same route all the time. Try a new route to help keep you motivated.
# Head out to Richmond Park and try running a few hills. These are great to improve your strength and fitness levels. Start off slowly and remember not to increase your efforts by more than 10% per week to help avoid injuries.
# Cross training is a great way to improve strength. Get out on your bike and cycle, or visit the local swimming pool and do some lengths.
# Vary your training programme so you do not get bored. Try a speed session, strength training or a long run.
# Make sure if you are heading out for more than 60 minutes, take a sports drink with you. This will help keep you hydrated whilst providing important energy for your longer session.
