> There have been no major disruptions in the borough following the start of the 48-hour industrial action, with just one library closed. Other front line services are operating as normal with all schools open and waste and recycling collections running as usual. There has been a reduced service for some day care centre users following action by employees from Transport Services and a number of support staff. However, no day centres have closed and our most vulnerable service users continue to receive support.
> 
> We hope that any disruption to residents will continue to be minimal and that the dispute will be settled quickly.
