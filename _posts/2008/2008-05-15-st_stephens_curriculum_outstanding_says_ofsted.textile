St Stephen's varied and interesting curriculum was highly praised by inspectors when the school underwent a recent Ofsted inspection. According to the report, "aspects of the curriculum are outstanding. There is excellent provision for health education and pupils understand very well healthy-living issues. The many opportunities for pupils to engage in creative work is a considerable strength."

bq. "We are very proud of our Ofsted report.  Overall, our school was awarded a good accreditation which is testament to the positive learning environment created at St Stephen's by our excellent staff and pupils. We have worked hard to ensure our curriculum meets the needs of all our pupils. Of paramount importance to us at St Stephen's is the happiness of our children and we are delighted that Ofsted highlighted the importance we place on pastoral care," 

explains headteacher, Liz Stubbs. Staff relationships were found to be excellent between all members of the school community, while teachers and support workers were seen as good role models.

The inspectorate found that the school's "caring ethos and Christian values underpin the pupils' excellent personal development. Consequently, pupils are prepared well for moving on to secondary school." Ofsted also found that the school is good at supporting parents to help children who have difficulties with reading.

Areas of academic excellence were highlighted, with Ofsted  recording that progress is consistently good in English and was outstanding for pupils leaving in 2007. The school's good  provision for modern languages was also highlighted. Children learn French and Spanish, with years five and six receiving taster lessons in Japanese and Russian.

The school governing body was seen as very supportive.
