AHM-Go! is running a pilot scheme for the St Margaret's / Twickenham area to promote Low Impact Cardio exercise by the Thames.  This is Community Focused and does not have a membership or weekly fee - its Free!

This is aimed at those who want to power walk or jog in a group both in rain & shine!  AHM requires at least 10 members before we start, so please visit our website for more details: [www.AHM-Go.com](http://www.AHM-Go.com/), contact: <info@AHM-Go.com> or phone Julia on 07880 713 927. 

Positive individuals are 6 times more likely to achieve their aspirations!
