    When they start handing out medals for the "Most Dynamic Community Group of the Year", at the very front of the queue will be NSMRA... the mighty 'North St Margarets Residents' Association'. Their record of community activities ranges from regular dances, quizzes and children's parties through to their signature event - GASS Day - the Great Annual Street Sale, which takes place on Saturday 6th September from 2.00pm.

When they start handing out medals for the "Most Dynamic Community Group of the Year", at the very front of the queue will be NSMRA... the mighty 'North St Margarets Residents' Association'. Their record of community activities ranges from regular dances, quizzes and children's parties through to their signature event - GASS Day - the Great Annual Street Sale, which takes place on Saturday 6th September from 2.00pm.

The idea couldn't be simpler. Take a table, stick it on the pavement outside your house, cover it with all those things that you no longer need - and sell 'em. It is like a massive car boot sale but without the car - or the boot. The array of things up for grabs at bargain basement prices is vast, from toys, books, CD's and bric-a-brac at one end to home made cakes, jams, pickles, plants and Christmas cards at the other. Gardeners from the allotments will be selling fresh fruit and vegetables; the Church is running a Caf√© and a Fair Trade stall. Even a team of neighbourhood police will be there marking bicycles. Last year GASS attracted nearly 60 stalls out onto the street which, according to one resident, were visible from aircraft flying into Heathrow!

Such is the success of GASS Day that this year the event is being opened up to people living outside the immediate NSMRA area. If you have a table and a load of junk - er, sorry, objects d'art - that you would like to sell please contact Nick Grossman on "NSMRA@btinternet.com":mailto:NSMRA@btinternet.com.  Space is limited so please do not delay. This invitation is not open to commercial organisations.

For those unhappy souls who rarely venture north to the other side of the A316, NSMRA represents the good folk living in Northcote, Haliburton, Newry, Talbot, Heron and St Margarets Roads. To find GASS, stroll up the St Margarets Road towards old Isleworth and turn left just past the Ailsa pub.  You have nothing to lose but your small change!

Put a note into your diary... GREAT ANNUAL STREET SALE  - September 6<sup>th</sup> from 2.00pm.
