The Mayor of London has recently announced the final of a competition which will result in ten London parks winning &pound;400,000 each. One of the 47 finalists is Crane Valley Park a project which the Friends of the River Crane Environment (FORCE) have been promoting, together with the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames , the London Borough of Hounslow and London Wildlife Trust.

If we were to win, this funding would enable a new park to be created, doubling the length of the existing Crane Park , and providing a continuous managed green valley park linking Twickenham Station in the east with Hounslow Heath in the west. Crane Valley Park would give local people of all ages somewhere to walk and cycle, to enjoy nature and the fresh air.


Whilst it is good news that Crane Valley Park has reached the final, we now need people to vote for it because the top ten parks will be decided by public vote.   We would therefore be very grateful if you would go on-line to vote for Crane Valley Park . Encourage all your friends, colleagues and neighbours to do the same.  Each family member has a separate vote and there is no age limit, all you need is a London postcode. Voting has already started and runs through until 30th January 2009. Simply go to "www.london.gov.uk/parksvote":http://www.london.gov.uk/parksvote , click on South West London and vote for "Crane Valley Park" or visit the FORCE website www.force.org.uk and follow the link.

Please also pass this message on - there is nothing to lose and we could gain a new and improved park for the Crane Valley and for Richmond .
