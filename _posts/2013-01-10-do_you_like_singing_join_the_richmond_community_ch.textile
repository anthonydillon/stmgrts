    If so, why not come and join Richmond Community Choir in St Margarets?
    Set up and sponsored by Richmond upon Thames College as an evening class five years ago, and now a self-managed Charity, Richmond Community Choir now has over 30 friendly and welcoming members of all ages united by their enjoyment of singing.
    
    Led by an inspiring and experienced director/composer/arranger, we build a changing repertoire of shorter pieces, democratically chosen, and covering a wide range of both secular and sacred music from the middle ages up to pop and musical classics.
    
    Membership of the Choir is open to all and is without audition, and although sheet music is provided, sight reading is not necessary. The Choir performs both as part of College events and also increasingly in other venues.
