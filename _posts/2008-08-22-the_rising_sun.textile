We are now under new ownership.

We are starting an extensive refurbishment and will reopen at the end of September 2008.

The Rising Sun is situated opposite Marble Hill Park and St Stephens church between Richmond and Twickenham, well served by public transport with buses stopping outside.

Our opening times will be from 12.00 midday to 12.00 midnight on Sundays to Thursdays and from 12.00  to 01.00 on Fridays and Saturdays.

We will be serving food lunchtimes and evenings.

The Jazz Showcase will continue on Monday evenings from September 29th. There will be other live music through the week.

If you are interested in booking the Rising Sun for a private party we can cater for groups of up to 80 people.

We are taking bookings for Christmas, please contact us through our new website.
