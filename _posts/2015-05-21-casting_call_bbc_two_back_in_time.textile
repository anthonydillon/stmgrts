_We are looking for a London-based family to take part in another Back In Time social history experiment for BBC Two, summer 2015._

Following the huge success of BBC Two's Back in Time For Dinner (please see BBC iplayer for example episodes) we are looking for a family who, just like the Robshaws, will immerse themselves this time in the leisure and entertainment habits of decades past. We are looking for families with a minimum of two children aged 10+ who are available to film over the summer holidays of July and August 2015.


The family should have thoroughly modern leisure habits - turn to modern technology for entertainment and leisure time and enjoy weekend shopping and cinema trips. In a previous series we have filmed at the family home and local businesses and amenities so it may be of interest to those who live in your area.
