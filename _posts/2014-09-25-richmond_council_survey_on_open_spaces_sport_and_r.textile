Take part in a Richmond Council survey that is part of a large scale study of Richmond borough's open spaces, sports and recreational provision. The study will look at all existing facilities and assess requirements for the future. 

They would like to hear from as many people as possible who use or have an interest in the green spaces or recreation facilities around the borough - please complete the survey by 2nd November 2014.
