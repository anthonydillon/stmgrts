Three recent planning applications have been submitted for the Brunel site which will have an impact on the area. Two are for staff accommodation to replace garages attached to five bedroom houses. 

They are:


* "Construction of two storey annexe for staff accommodation in place of single storey garage":http://www.ukplanning.com/richmond/showCaseFile.do?councilName=London+Borough+of+Richmond+upon+Thames&appNumber=05/2869/FUL
This seeks to turn what was an approved garage (as approved under application number 02/3734) into a two story, four bedroom rooming house.
* "Construction of two storey annexe for staff accommodation in place of single storey garage":http://www.ukplanning.com/richmond/showCaseFile.do?councilName=London+Borough+of+Richmond+upon+Thames&appNumber=05/2873/FUL
This seeks to turn was an approved garage (as approved under application number 02/3734) attached to a larger five bedroom house into a one bedroom, two story home with a kitchen.

Both of these will add to the number of people living on the site and reduce the amount of available parking.

The third application is:

* "Erection of side gate to rear garden from Kilmorey Road":http://www.ukplanning.com/richmond/showCaseFile.do?councilName=London+Borough+of+Richmond+upon+Thames&appNumber=05/2973/FUL
This is the second request for a gate in the historic wall around the site, probably for easier access to parking.  The previous request was rejected by the council.  The gate would provide access to a garden that already has access via another gate.
