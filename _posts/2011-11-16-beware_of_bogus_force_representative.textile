Heathfield Safer Neighbourhood Team have informed us that a man has been calling door to door in the Crane Park area,  claiming to be working on behalf of the Friends of the river Crane Environment (FORCE) and requesting bank details in order to set up direct debits to support a recovery fund for the River Crane.

We have no knowledge of this man or the scheme and it is not a method that we would ever adopt or support.    If you are approached please do not provide any personal information and inform the police by calling 101.

We are working with the Environment Agency, Thames Water and others to develop a response to the pollution incident on the River Crane and expect this to be fully funded by Thames Water.

FORCE does run a membership scheme, details of this are available on our website
