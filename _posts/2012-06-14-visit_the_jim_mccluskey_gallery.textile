    Following a successful exhibition in a gallery on Richmond Hill I decided to create a web site showing my paintings - "jimmccluskeygallery.wordpress.com":http://jimmccluskeygallery.wordpress.com/
    
    I now use my house and studio on St Margarets Road (near Richmond Bridge) as a gallery and anyone interested in my paintings are very welcome to come and have a look.
