h3. The Queens Suite

This exquisite piece of music was written by Duke Ellington after he met the young Queen Elizabeth in 1958 at a private reception to mark the Bicentenary of Leeds festival.  So inspired and moved was he by the meeting that he locked himself away to compose a piece of music for her, working also with the iconic lyricist and composer Billy Strayhorn.  Only one LP pressing was made and sent directly to  Buckingham Palace. The music is widely regarded as one of Ellington's  most beautiful and sensitive works.
Sadly it was never released during his lifetime.
