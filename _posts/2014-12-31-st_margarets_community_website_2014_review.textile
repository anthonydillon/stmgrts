h3. How people accessed the site

<a href="//stmgrts.org.uk/assets/images/2014/chart1-2.png" title="See larger version of - how people access"><img src="//stmgrts.org.uk/assets/images/2014/chart1-2_thumb.png" width="250" height="237" alt="how people access" class="photo right" /></a>

One trend we have been watching is how many people are now using the site on phones and tablets.  This is why we made the site responsive in June, to work better on smaller screens.

|Device Category|% of sessions|% change from 2013|
|tablet|16.89%|+5.96%|
|mobile|23.48%|+4.88%|
|desktop|59.63%|-10.83%|
