_Buy a Piece of Pluto The Surgical Robot for &pound;1 and help kids and babies get better quicker_

The ChildrenÂ´s Hospital Trust Fund (CHTF), based at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, has launched the Pluto website, "www.theplutoappeal.com":http://www.theplutoappeal.com, which is part of the hospital's Children's Sunshine Appeal.

A major piece of equipment the charity wishes to purchase is a robot named Pluto which will allow the hospital to perform intricate surgery on babies and children with more precision, better recovery times, shorter hospital stays and smaller scars.  The website aims to raise &pound;1.2million to buy Pluto.

The campaign is based on _The Million Dollar Homepage_, a website created by student Alex Tew in 2006, when he divided a homepage into a million pixels and sold them to advertisers.  Pluto will be divided in the same way: each pixel costs &pound;1 and, as more pixels are bought, Pluto will begin to come alive in colour.

The launch event, held at Altitude 360 Black, Millbank Tower, on Wednesday 29 June was hosted by Gadget Show presenter and technology enthusiast and St Margarets resident, Jason Bradbury.

Jason, whose son was treated in a neonatal unit, will unveil the Pluto Robot the charity wishes to buy. Other popular robots, R2D2 and Titan, will also be there to add fun to the evening.

Mr Munther Haddad, head of children's surgery at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital said: 

bq.. "Pluto will be a welcomed addition to our team of specialist surgeons and I personally love the website appeal which makes it easy for people to donate and see the campaign progress".

"Operating on small babies, sometimes weighing less than half a bag of sugar, requires great skill and Pluto allows for unparalleled precision and control and Chelsea and Westminster Hospital can provide a unique level of care to babies and children in the UK."

p. Pluto will be the first robot dedicated to paediatric surgery in the South of England and the hospital will become a beacon of this type of treatment in the South of England.
