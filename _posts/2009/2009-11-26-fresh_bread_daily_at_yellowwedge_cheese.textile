From Friday 27<sup>th</sup> November we'll be stocking bread from our award winning bakers throughout the week. There'll be the usual full range on Saturdays with a smaller selection of the best sellers on week days. You've asked us if we could provide a daily service, and now we will from Tuesday to Saturday. If you're already a fan you're in good company - our bakers also supply The Dorchester Hotel, The Fat Duck, Le Gavroche, The Savoy Grill, Virgin Atlantic First Class, Browns Hotel, Fortnum & Mason, Harvey Nichols, Selfridges, The Lanesborough Hotel, and more - but now you can enjoy their superb wares right here in St Margarets five days a week. They're likely to sell quickly, so do call early to avoid disappointment.

We have also included a range of favourites for Christmas pre-order - details in store.
