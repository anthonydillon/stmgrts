    On Sunday 19<sup>th</sup> July residents of North St Margarets, the bit past the Ailsa Tavern, will be linking up with All Souls Church and sitting down to a <a href="https://stmargarets.london/event/fair/200705142185">Big Lunch</a> together.
    
    The Big Lunch is a national event organised by the Eden Project to encourage neighbours and communities to share lunch on one day of the year. So <a href="https://stmargarets.london/directory/group/200506300538">North St Margarets Residents' Association</a> together will <a href="https://stmargarets.london/directory/church/200506080805">All Souls Church</a> thought it would be a great opportunity for a _Street Party_. One end of Northcote Road will be closed off and residents are being asked simply to bring some food and drink to share and turn up. There will be a marquee, live music, a bouncy castle, street chalk pictures and face painting and lots more - in fact, all the fun of a party!

Residents' Association committee member Judy Maciejowska said:

> "When we first heard about the Big Lunch we thought it was too good an opportunity to miss. We have a smashing community here in St Margarets, and a street party with locally produced food is another good way to meet people you may not bump into everyday. It's shaping up to be a really great event and it looks as if the rain will keep away. It's good also to be working with All Souls Church, and they've offered us use of the church if the heavens do open!"
