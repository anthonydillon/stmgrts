    Plans for the Family Fun Day are going well, Jason Bradbury and Amanda Holden have both recently agreed to attend.
    
    We do have a couple of spaces left in the St Margarets Got Talent show though. We are looking for children or adults who would like to take part in the contest.
    
    Full details and entry forms are available from Kim Hare at Nigel Hare Joinery - 32 Crown Road.
