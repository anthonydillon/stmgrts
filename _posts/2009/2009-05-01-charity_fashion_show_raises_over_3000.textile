One of the recent highlights at Parvinu was a Lingerie and Swimwear fashion show held in aid of "Lynn's Bowel Cancer Campaign":http://www.bowelcancer.tv

The show was hosted by Susana Lorena who owns and runs SL Privee, a lingerie shop on Richmond Hill. It was a packed house and we were delighted to support the event and play our part by assisting with the setting, the music, light bites and crisp cold prosecco, all of which helped the evening really go off with a bang.

The most pleasing aspect of the evening was being able to work successfully with local businesses and charities, fulfilling our desire to become a positive part of the local community.

At the time of writing the charity had raised over &pound;3,000 on the evening.
