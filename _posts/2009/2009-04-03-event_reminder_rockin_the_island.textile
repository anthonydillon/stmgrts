bq. "Have you heard the news? There's good rocking tonight!"

Since the old Eel Pie Hotel in Twickenham and its famous jazz and blues club burnt down in 1971 things have been pretty quiet on Eel Pie Island. Water gently laps, birds sweetly coo and boats bob soothingly on their moorings. All is peace and calm. Well, at least until now!
