"2x2 Opera":http://stmargarets.london/directory/music/200602010743 is a small community opera group based in St Margarets specialising in adapting and presenting opera performed by -- and for -- young people.  This year we are presenting Offenbach's comic musical theatre, Robinson Crusoe and are delighted to be performing in the new theatre at the Musical Museum in Brentford on 26, 27 and 28 March 2009.  This will be our sixth production and we will be conducted and trained by Greg Beardsell, Associate Conductor of the National Youth Choir, and Dominic Peckham, also from NYC.

We are holding open auditions on Saturday 10<sup>th</sup> January for four solo roles to support the three professional singers and there are also places available in the chorus of Pirates and Cannibals.  This is a great opportunity for young people to take part in a professionally led production and have a lot of fun at the same time.  The solo roles are suitable for teenagers aged approximately 15 years and over, although one part may be more suitable for an older mezzo soprano.  The chorus parts however, are suitable for any age and we particularly welcome men and boys with broken voices. There are also opportunities to help behind the scenes.  Just come along to St Stephens' School Hall on Saturday 10<sup>th</sup> January to find out more.
