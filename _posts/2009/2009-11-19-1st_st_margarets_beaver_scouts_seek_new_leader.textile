The 1st St Margarets Scouts' Beaver Colony faces closure unless it can find a new leader by the end of December.

Current leader Simon Bliss, who responded to an article in last year's local press is heading back to his native Australia and, with no replacement on the horizon, the Colony's 14 year history will come to an end.

Aged 6 to 8, Beaver Scouts are the youngest members of the Scout association.  They progress to Cubs and then to becoming full Scouts at age 10.

Recent activities have included a Vikings project, Safety and Emergency Aid and a visit from an Army Major talking about Army life and his role in the Army.

Outgoing Beaver Leader Simon says "I will be sad to go and really hope this 30-strong Colony can go forward with a new leader."

1st St Margarets Scout Leader James Round says "Beavers are the first step on an exciting journey to Scouts and beyond.  Being a Leader is tremendously rewarding and certainly looks good on a CV!  This role might appeal to a former Scout or Guide,  or someone who would enjoy the challenge fun of working with children of this age."

1st St Margarets Scout Group is well supported by parents and its Parent Committee and there are 30-strong Cub Scout and full Scout sections.  Current Beavers assistant organiser Monica Cruz, is also happy to stay on and work with the new leader.

The Group is also looking for adult helpers for Beavers, Cubs and Scouts.

Full training will be given for these roles, with childcare costs provided if needed.

Anyone interested in finding out more about either role should contact Jo Kitson 020 8891 2110, email "Johanna_kitson@hotmail.com":mailto:Johanna_kitson@hotmail.com
