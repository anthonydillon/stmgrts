We hope to be able to support this event on a regular basis and help showcase the many and varied talented artistes that live and work in the local area.

Parvinu will also be open as usual, serving the best coffee, light breakfast pastries and our delicious brunch menu.

h4. Wednesday Night Jazz

Please "check out our May line up for live jazz on Wednesday Nights":https://stmargarets.london/directory/restaurant/200809111151. We have quickly established ourselves as one of the best local spots to offer live jazz, specializing in bluesy, soul, bossa and lounge sounds which perfectly compliment the laid back surroundings at Parvinu. We make sure that we feature locally based performers and given the huge amount of talent living and working in the area we are never short of acts!
