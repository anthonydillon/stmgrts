This is a really unusual opportunity. 'Lilian of Stockholm' is a beautiful and lovingly restored 30m 'gentleman's motor yacht', over 90 years old, moored at Twickenham riverside, access via Duck's Walk, Twickenham, TW1 2DD. If the weather's good, you can paint views of Richmond from the deck, or of Lilian from the adjoining pontoon; if not, below decks there are the saloon, bedrooms and galley with original joinery and fittings (and the historic diesel engines.)
Maximum 20 people - so book early!

Everyone welcome - Beginners too!
