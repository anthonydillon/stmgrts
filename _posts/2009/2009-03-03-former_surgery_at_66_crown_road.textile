<em>more details following on a "previous article":http://stmargarets.london/archives/2009/02/forum_post_66_crown_road_conversion_to_8_bedsits.html</em>

Mr Richard Carter of Richmond Council Enforcement Team has been aware of the building work at 66 Crown Road without planning permission since January 09. He has visited the site and spoken to the landlord who has told him it is being changed into 8 separate bed sits without planning permission.

No planning permission has been applied for and none has been given however because they have told Mr Carter that they do intend to apply for planning permission this week the council are not currently taking any action at all.

If you wish to register your views you can "notify the enforcement team of a breach of planning permission online":http://forms.richmond.gov.uk/AF3/an/default.aspx/RenderForm/?F.Name=P-QjeQQhbg_ or you can email "envprotection@richmond.gov.uk":mailto:envprotection@richmond.gov.uk or call Mr Carter directly on 020 8891 7458.

If you do register your opinion with the council you will be automatically notified by them of any application for planning permission should one be made.
