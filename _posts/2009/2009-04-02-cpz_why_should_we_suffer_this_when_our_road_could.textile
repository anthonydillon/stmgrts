    These two photos were taken at the same time of the day (9 am); the one of Godstone Road is full of parked commuter traffic, while Winchester Road remains almost empty.  This is how effective restricted parking is at pushing more cars onto de-restricted roads like Godstone.  The only way to ensure this does not get even worse is to ensure Godstone Road is included in the CPZ.

These two photos were taken at the same time of the day (9 am); the one of Godstone Road is full of parked commuter traffic, while Winchester Road remains almost empty.  This is how effective restricted parking is at pushing more cars onto de-restricted roads like Godstone.  The only way to ensure this does not get even worse is to ensure Godstone Road is included in the CPZ.

I have just moved into this lovely area with my young son; getting him to and from my car and home several times a day is a real problem for me. I'm sure most of the residents of Godstone Road have their own troubles coping with this unwanted traffic hassle and we can put a stop to it simply be responding to the Council's enquiry.

Please take some time to complete the request to bring organisation to our road and ensure we have a quieter and more hassle free life.
