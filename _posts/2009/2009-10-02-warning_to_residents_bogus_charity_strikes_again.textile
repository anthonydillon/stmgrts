    Recently leaflets have been posted by an alleged charity collecting for third world countries.  They will be collecting tomorrow Saturday 3 October.  The name of the charity is W&W Help limited with the company number 6296698.  According to the companies house website the company was dissolved in March of this year.  I found "this article in The Northern Echo warning Darlington residents":http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/4227023.Warning_over_clothing_collection_company/.

Recently leaflets have been posted by an alleged charity collecting for third world countries.  They will be collecting tomorrow Saturday 3 October.  The name of the charity is W&W Help limited with the company number 6296698.  According to the companies house website the company was dissolved in March of this year.

If you want to know more about the impact these companies have on legitimate charities check out a previous piece I wrote for the website --  "Beware Bogus 'Charities' and Third World Appeals":https://stmargarets.london/archives/2006/11/beware_bogus_ch.html

Please please do not encourage these companies by leaving bags out for them.
