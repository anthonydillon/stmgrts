What a lovely sunny day, Crown Road closed to traffic and a great chance to walk along the street and look at the shops and stalls whilst  mingling  with friends and neighbours.

At the top of the road Parvinu were lured out of the wine bar basement to set up antique tables and chairs in the street offering prosecco and a comfy chair. Our local community police officers had changed their shifts so that they could come and join in meeting local residents and offering to mark mobile phones and bicycles. Zoran was serving his usual high class burgers and Sunshine and Ravioli were doing a great trade in hot dogs. The crowds in the street were joined by Vincent Cable our local MP.

Centre stage was the Has St Margarets got Talent Contest held on the big stage donated by a local business man Gary Flynn at London Network Scaffolding. Residents were queuing up to display their talents from Tango dancing to street dancing and Irish dancing no shortage of singers and music from local bands. Chris from Rock and Fairy the new hairdressing salon seemed to feature in quite a few of the bands!  The talent show was hosted by John Stapleton and Lynn Faulds Wood. Amanda Holden was unable to attend at the last minute and the crowd was not disappointed when Peter Davison stepped in to help out.  Local star of TV's  Gadget show Jason Bradbury and Gail Porter kept the crowd entertained and if you missed Jason's amazing break dancing demo you really missed something spectacular.

The event was intended to raise both money and awareness of bowel cancer. Crown Road is the home of Lynn's  Bowel Cancer Campaign and they said;

bq. "What an amazing day  -  great for raising awareness of the symptoms of bowel cancer and lots of money raised too - which will help us to save even more lives. A big thank you to absolutely everyone involved especially Simon, Barry. Anita and Pete too for making all of our games"

St Margarets is some times called the village by the estate agents but it certainly felt like a great place to be on Sunday 14<sup>th</sup> June.
