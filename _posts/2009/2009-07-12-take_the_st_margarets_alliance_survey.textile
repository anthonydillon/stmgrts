_St Margarets Alliance Survey takes lead in Sustainable Community Act, seeking views for its Community Action Plan_

This week the St Margarets Alliance "distributed a survey (which you can take online)":http://stmargarets.london/sma_survey as the first stage towards a Community Action Plan.  The Survey asks residents to consider which aspects of their local environment, economy, or social well-being are most important to them and to prioritise the most important and urgent.

St Margarets Alliance covers the voting ward of St Margarets and North Twickenham.  It is made up of representatives from the North St Margarets Residents' Association, Moormead Residents, Amyand Park Residents, St Margarets Traders and others.

The group is so far best known as the organisation behind St Margarets' Crown Road summer and Christmas events -- including the recent Family Fun Day on Sunday 14<sup>th</sup> June.

The group is non party-political and its purpose is to coordinate a Community Action Plan for the area. St Margarets Alliance does not have a specific agenda for the St Margarets area: the results of the Survey will form the basis for the basis of all future initiatives.  The group's guiding principle is 'residents first'.

Community Action Plans are central to the Sustainable Communities Act (SCA) of 2007, which aims to create a more local form of democracy.  The Plans are approved by the Secretary of State and funded from central government and community funds.  As such, Community Action Plans help communities to shape their economic, social and environmental well-being.

A survey is not mandatory to the creation of a Community Action Plan but the St Margarets Alliance team aim to create a template for best practice across the UK.  Chair Barry Edwards is the Sustainable Communities Act Regional Coordinator for the Environmental Law Foundation which has set up a national network of coordinators to support sustainable communities and give access to environmental justice.

A copy of the Survey is being distributed to every household in the St Margarets and North Twickenham voting ward.  The deadline for completion and return of the Survey is 17<sup>th</sup> July.  It can be "completed online on the St Margarets Community Website":http://stmargarets.london/sma_survey/   The printing of the Survey has been sponsored by local letting agent Churchill's.

The results of the Survey will be communicated to the local press and will be published both on the community website and the "St Margarets Alliance website":http://www.stmargaretsalliance.com The current Survey is the first stage of the Plan's formulation.  St Margaret's Alliance may wish to complete further research to get the views of local residents and under-represented groups when the specific topic are identified from the Survey returns. At recent Crown Road events over 150 residents have already registered to assist a Community Action Plan.  It is estimated that the formulation of St Margarets Community Action Plan will take around 3 months.  The timescale for completion of any agreed actions will be assessed once they are known.

Chair Barry Edwards, Guy Medd (25 years St Margarets resident) and Glen Cardno (a local St Margarets Trader) are considering standing as Independent candidates at the Local Authority elections scheduled for 10<sup>th</sup> May 2010, to follow what the St Margarets Alliance as a representative body wants for local residents.

Chair Barry Edwards says "This Survey represents a great opportunity for residents to prioritise what matters to them".
