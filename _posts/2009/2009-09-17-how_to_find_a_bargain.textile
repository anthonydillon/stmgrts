_Great Annual Street Sale  - September 19<sup>th</sup>_

Hard to believe but on Saturday 19<sup>th</sup> September the streets of North St. Margarets are going to be stuffed with some real bargains as the locals residents, entrepreneurs all, set out stalls for their annual street sale.

Like a car boot sale, but without the car or the boot, the streets will take on the atmosphere of an eastern bazaar with some hot deals - books, C.D's clothing, toys, bric-a-brac, fruit and vegetables, cakes, electronic goods -- you name it, they've got it! All you have to do is get there. It starts at 2.00pm and the trading streets are: Northcote Road, Haliburton Road, Newry Road, Heron Road and Talbot Road.

*Put a note into your diary... GREAT ANNUAL STREET SALE -- SEPTEMBER 19th   from 2.00pm*
