* "ADAM BLOOM":http://www.adam-bloom.com/ (our very own - born in these parts) will bamboozle your mind with his fast-talking logical funnies.
* "OTIZ CANNELLONI":http://www.myspace.com/otizcannelloni - (almost our very own!) Reluctant Messiah - man of the people - O level Woodwork!
* "DAVID HADINGHAM":http://www.comedycv.co.uk/davidhadingham/index.htm - to say some of David's material is Dark is an insult to Black! Very Dangerous - very Funny
* "ANDI OSHO":http://www.andiosho.co.uk/ captivated the Bearcat last season with her assured and dynamic comedy. Multi-talented and destined for Stardom
