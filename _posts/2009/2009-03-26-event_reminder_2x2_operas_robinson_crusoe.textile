This is our sixth production and involves a staggering 62 strong chorus of children and young people from the local schools in St Margarets, Twickenham and further afield, and local residents.  We are thrilled to have Greg Beardsell, Associate Conductor of the National Youth Choirs of Great Britain to conduct, assisted by Dominic Peckham, also from the NYC.  We are joined by professional singers Michael Davis who some may remember as the Father in last year's Hansel and Gretel, Sarah Jane Dale, and Harry Bagnall.

Local resident and TV producer Keith Cheetham directs this new adaptation.
