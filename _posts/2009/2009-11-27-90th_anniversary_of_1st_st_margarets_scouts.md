This week was the actual anniversary of 1<sup>st</sup> St Margarets.

Congratulations!

> In the summer of 1919 a local man, Mr Laurence, came to the conclusion that the only thing St Margarets needed to turn it into an earthly paradise- all the other necessary attributes being in place - was a Scout Troop, so on November 24th he started one. He cunningly called it the "1<sup>st</sup> St Margarets" and himself, being the leader, "Skipper". The story has it that the first meetings were held under a gaslight on a street corner. True or not the fledgling troop soon found themselves settled in a room over Shipman's Garage behind St Margarets Hotel.

And don't forget, they are still looking for a [Beaver Leader.](https://stmargarets.london/archives/2009/11/1st_st_margarets_beaver_scouts_seek_new_leader.html)
