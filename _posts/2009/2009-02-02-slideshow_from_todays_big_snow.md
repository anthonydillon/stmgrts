*editorial note:* I would like to say to the 'gentleman' who decided to knock my children's snowman down to re-use it for his daughters, within minutes of them finishing it, you are the lowest form of pond-life and a reflection of all that is wrong in the world! On a day like yesterday, with the snow that was around, you are mean and lazy and deeply hurt my children's feelings.
