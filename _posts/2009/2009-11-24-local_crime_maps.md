Residents may not be aware that the Metropolitan Police introduced a crime mapping system some months ago. By simply entering your post code and searching, you can find the the latest crime figures for your area and links to your local Safer Neighbourhood Team will then be displayed.

The website is located at [maps.met.police.uk](http://maps.met.police.uk/)

By clicking on "Crime Types" you can narrow your enquiry. Crime prevention advice for each crime type displayed can be obtained from a panel on the right of the screen.
