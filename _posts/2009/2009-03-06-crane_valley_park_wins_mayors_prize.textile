    FORCE ( "Friends of the River Crane Environment":http://www.force.org.uk/ ) are delighted to announce that Crane Valley Park is one of the winners of the Mayor's Priority Parks programme. We are very grateful to everyone who voted for Crane Valley Park - the response from local people, and particularly local schoolchildren, has been terrific. In fact we polled 6,677 votes which was the highest score for any of the parks across the whole of London. So a huge thank you goes out to all our members and their friends and families.

The award was formally announced to the press, radio and television by Boris Johnson himself in Crane Park this morning. The full results can be "viewed online":http://www.london.gov.uk/parksvote/results/

The work now begins in earnest to use the award of &pound;400,000 to create a bigger and better park for all to enjoy.
