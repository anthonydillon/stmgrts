> The old surgery at 66 Crown road is currently being converted into 8 bed-sits. There is no planning application for this, no change of use has been granted and the builders are working as I type.
> 
>  A previous planning application in respect of 66 Crown Road was refused last year. Richmond council have opened an enforcement case 09/0013EN.
> 
>  If, like me, you have concerns regarding this development please email <planningenforcement@richmond.gov.uk> quoting the case number above.
