AHM provides Community Focused 'Low Impact Cardio' exercise by the River Thames on Saturdays at 10am, Orleans Gardens by the Cafe / playground (back of Marble Hill Park).  You need to be able to walk 45-minutes at ease, motivated and weather hardy as you are in the elements. Its FREE, its FUN, and its aimed at  YOU!

We start with a warm up for 10 minutes both in the Gardens and along the tow path and stretch at the lay-by (where there are 6 or so benches), into gentle CV to Richmond Bridge, a bit more stretching, then back to the Gardens via the lay-by again with more stretching (dips & press-ups are optional).  Even if you just want to walk, that is fine -- let the group know, as they will work around you.  Age group?  16's up to the 70's (the eldest in S'Wark is 78 and Type 2 diabetic), we also promote parents bringing their children 8 years old and above.

Email AHM for a health form and away you go!  Exercising in numbers is motivating, safer and inspiring!

What to wear: black tracksuit bottoms, trainers and a black, purple or blue top (Purple is AHM's colour).
