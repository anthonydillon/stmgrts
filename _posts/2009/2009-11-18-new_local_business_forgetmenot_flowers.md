An exciting new flower delivery service, [Forgetmenot Flowers](/directory/gifts/200911191056), has just been launched in St Maragrets. Sign up for one of Forgetmenot Flowers' bespoke packages and there will be no excuse to forget a birthday or anniversary ever again.

Each package will be tailored to your individual requirements so that beautifully hand crafted flowers will be personally delivered to your loved ones on selected days throughout the year. Whether it is a birthday, wedding anniversary, Mother's Day or Valentine's Day, allow Forgetmenot Flowers' creative team to set your mind at rest and make every special day truly memorable. Twelve months' peace of mind costs from £295 per year for twelve beautiful bouquets.

Alternatively treat yourself or a loved one to a weekly treat of seasonal blooms with Forgetmenot's Friday Flowers, a great way to kick start the weekend. Fresh, beautiful flowers will hand delivered directly to your door for £12.50 per week.

Roisin Morris and Elle Goulden-White of Forgetmenot Flowers commented,

> "We realised there was a gap in the market for a florist which catered specifically to a client's needs throughout the year. Each bouquet is hand wrapped and tied with a label describing each flower and how best to maintain your flowers in perfect condition. If you prefer, Forgetmenot Flowers can deliver the bouquets to different addresses within the delivery area, so you can please your wife, and the mother-in-law all in one go; no challenge is too great for Forgetmenot Flowers!"
