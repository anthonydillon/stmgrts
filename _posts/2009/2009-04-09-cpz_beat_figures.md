Richmond Borough Council conducted a 'Beat' survey as a guide to determine what if any parking problems exist in an area. This is done by comparing car registration plates at different times of the day. The 4.30am figure would indicate the total number of residents parked, whilst the day time figures would represent a mix of residents and visitors.

*Survey conducted Tuesday Nov 2007*

|                    |          |        |          |
|--------------------|----------|--------|----------|
| Street             | 4.30a.m. | 10a.m. | 4.30p.m. |
| Sidney Rd          | 67       | 56     | 60       |
| Winchester         | 104      | 86     | 83       |
| Bridge Rd          | 30       | 28     | 27       |
| South Western      | 72       | 53     | 55       |
| Godstone Rd        | 71       | 68     | 66       |
| Kenley Rd          | 74       | 66     | 66       |
| Hill View Rd       | 41       | 48     | 31       |
| Moor Mead Rd       | 70       | 61     | 64       |
| Chertsey Rd        | 29       | 31     | 30       |
| Brook Rd           | 30       | 25     | 26       |
| St Margarets Grove | 91       | 81     | 81       |
| (Broadway Av)      | 47       | 28     | 32       |
| Total:             | 726      | 631    | 621      |

From the *Beat survey* you can see that there are approximately 100 fewer cars parked during the day than at night
