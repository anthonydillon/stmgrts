This pub has reopened as the "Rising Sun/Marble Hill":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/directory/pub/200611051507 a 'food led pub' under new management which is 'open all day offering freshly cooked food, great ales/beers and specially selected wines'. The new tenant is Jamie McCarthy of Marble Hill [UK] Ltd, which is said to be backed by Chinese restaurateurs. I have a report of a friendly welcome the other day but have not yet been in myself. The website has not yet been updated. The pub has lost its entertainments licence so it is no longer a music venue.

Residents, including children, are invited to a drinks evening at 6 pm on Sunday July 26. RSVP to: "marblehillpub@yahoo.co.uk":mailto:marblehillpub@yahoo.co.uk or just turn up. They say that 'this drinks evening will be a great opportunity to voice any previous concerns and how can work closely together into the future'.
