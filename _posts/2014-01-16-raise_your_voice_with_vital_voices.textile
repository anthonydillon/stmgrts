    _A New Way of using your Voice_
    
    Vital Voices is  a new way of learning to sing, taking your voice in a new musical direction- it's not something you may have experienced before, or seen on TV -it's not Glee, nor a Church Choir or a community sing-song but  a  way to give Voice to the music inside you, and share it with others in a relaxed setting.

_A New Way of using your Voice_

Vital Voices is  a new way of learning to sing, taking your voice in a new musical direction- it's not something you may have experienced before, or seen on TV -it's not Glee, nor a Church Choir or a community sing-song but  a  way to give Voice to the music inside you, and share it with others in a relaxed setting.

We not only sing part songs but work on developing range and tone, learn to improvise and harmonise by ear, exploring, pushing the boundaries, playing with and learning how to care for our voice as well as using breathing techniques. There are so many benefits to singing, especially in groups and there have been many articles in the media recently about some of these.

We have a lovely sense of community in our group and often do fundraising and charity events, although no-one has to perform if they don't want to do so.
