The "St Margarets' Community Fair":http://stmgrts.org.uk/event/fair/200705141669 takes place in Crown Road on Saturday 29th September. Jamie Parker the event organiser, has done a tremendous job in putting together this event. Jamie has arranged lots of family entertainment including several live bands, circus acts, fun fair (with _free_ rides) street performers there is even a fire engine and a police car for the kids to check out.

The event is aimed at promoting local schools, charities, clubs and organisations but there _is still space to fill_ and Jamie is looking for more clubs, groups, charities etc... to take *FREE* stalls.

If you run or are part of an after school club or group, a Saturday morning club, allotment appreciation group, knitting circle, a member of 'nuclear physics for fun' group, poker school, surfing for beginners groups -- in fact all the associations you and your kids belong to and ask them to take part... its FREE.
 
For stall information please contact Jamie Parker  at "jamietparker@hotmail.com":mailto:jamietparker@hotmail.com or call 07837 762 866.
