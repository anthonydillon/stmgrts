Recently the current Councillors for St Margarets, have circulated a questionnaire to residents of; Bridge Road, Kenley Road, South Western Road, Brook Rood, Moormead Road, St Margarets Grove, Godstone Road, Sidney Road and Winchester Road asking their opinion as to whether they should push for a Controlled Parking Zone or CPZ in the area.

The _St Margarets Community Website_ has been told that by residents of Sidney Road that many people did not receive the forms at all and asked if we could help.  To that end, we have created an "online form":/forms/cpz_form.php that allows residents of these streets to pass their comments directly onto the Councillors.

* "Go to the form.":/forms/cpz_form.php
