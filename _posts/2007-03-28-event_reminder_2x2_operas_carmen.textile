2x2 Opera returns with its fourth production later this month with Keith Cheetham's 70 minute adaptation of Bizet's _Carmen_.  Once again, the production draws on the talents of children and young people from local schools both on and off stage. Schools taking part this year include St Stephen's, Orleans Park, Waldegrave, Hampton, Putney High, and Esher College.  We are delighted to welcome back Chris Colley (who appeared in _The Little Sweep_ and _A Very Magical Flute_ ) in the role of Escamillio this year, together with Kimberly Robinson ( _A Very Magical Flute_ ) as Carmen.  New to the ranks are Robert Tuohy, a recent graduate of the Royal Academy of Music, as conductor, together with Jonathan Stoughton as Don Jos&eacute;.
