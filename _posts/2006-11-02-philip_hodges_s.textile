Haweli of St Margarets, an Indian takeaway restaurant at 122 St Margarets Road has applied for planning approval to replace their existing timber shop front with a matte black aluminium one. 

To review and comment on the application, you can look on the council website "here":http://www.ukplanning.com/richmond/findCaseFile.do?appType=planning+folder&appNumber=06%2F3201%2FFUL&action=Search.

Some of the concerns raised by local residents already have been:

* An aluminium shopfront is entirely out of character and not suitable in a conservation area where wooden shop fronts should be retained. 
* If replacement is necessary, which is unlikely, the opportunity to put in something which maintains or improves the conservation area should be used.
