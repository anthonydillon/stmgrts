Oisin Rogers, the manager of the  "The St Margarets Tavern":/cgi-bin/directory.cgi?key=200505231529&action=getlisting is leaving after three years that have seen a massive turn-around for the pub.  Since the pub reopened its does after remodelling and the dinning room extension, the pub has become hugely popular every night of the week and with the Rugby crowds.  Oisin has also been a big supporter of the local community, always ready to help with sponsoring local events and often hiring many of the bands that play at the street fairs.

bq. "I will be very sad to leave _The St Margarets Tavern_ after three brilliant years. I was offered the opportunity to to run two fabulous businesses (one is the Boathouse in Putney). I have decided to oversee both of them and will be employed by Youngs Brewery. I do however hope to keep _The St Margarets Tavern_ as my local."

-- Oisin Rogers
