    Whether you want to develop and learn new skills in animation, costume design or textiles- there is a lot going on! Our workshops are based on two of our exciting exhibitions 'A Guest in Turner's House' (in the Stables Gallery) and 'Metamorphosis Open' (Riverside Gallery) and we can't wait to see how young people respond to these creative themes.

h4. Animating Metamorphosis: For 14-17 year olds

_Tuesday 31 March from 10am to 3pm at Stables Gallery._

Taking inspiration from the theme of metamorphosis, work with artist Kate Kennedy to learn and develop stop-frame animation skills. Create bold imagery and paper puppets to be used in your own short film and unique flipbooks.

h4. Turner- Your Way: For 14-17 year olds

_Wednesday 1 April from 10am to 3pm at Stables Gallery, with a visit to Turner's House._

Have the opportunity to visit the house of artist J.M.W Turner (currently under restoration) and find out about his life in Twickenham. Draw, photograph and paint your response to the building and use these marks to create a piece of textile art back at the gallery.

h4. Tactile Transformations: For 14-17 year olds

_Thursday 2 April from 10am to 3pm at Stables Gallery._

Work with artist Ashley Howell to learn and develop costume design skills. Experiment with wire, wood, fabric, paper and plastic to create a unique metamorphosis inspired costume.
