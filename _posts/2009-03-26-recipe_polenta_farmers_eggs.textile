<div class="recipe">

h3. Polenta Farmer's Eggs (Huevos Rancheros)

|3/4 cup (125 grams)|polenta|
|1.5 cups (375 ml)|water|
|1/4 tsp|salt|
|1/4 tsp|cumin seeds|
|1/4 tsp|coriander seeds|
|1 tsp|olive oil|
|1|green pepper diced|
|1|onion diced|
|1 can|diced tomatoes (drained)|
|6|eggs|

h4. Instructions

# Combine the polenta, salt and water in a pot and bring to a rolling boil. As soon as it boils, turn the heat off and let the polenta cool slightly and absorb all the water.
# Spread the polenta on the bottom of a greased 9x12 baking tray.
# Crush the coriander and cumin seeds in either a blender or a mortar and pestle (you can substitute powdered spices but the flavor will be milder)
# Saute the onions and peppers in the olive oil for about 5 minutes.
# Add the spices and drained tomatoes and cook another 2-3 minutes.
# Spoon the mixture on top of the polenta. Using a spoon make 6 indents in the vegetables where the eggs will go.
# Crack the eggs into the indentations.
# Cover the dish and cook at 180 degrees until the eggs have set. Approximately 20-25 minutes.

_This recipe can be partially made the night before. Simply put the dish in the refrigerator after step 6 and finish in the morning._
