Richmond Safer Transport Team and the Local Police Team are working in partnership to conduct a cycle marking operation commencing next week. This activity is part of Op SPOKE and will take place over 14 week days at 14 different train stations to give commuters across the borough a chance to have their cycles marked for free as a crime prevention initiative.
 
There will be officers at St Margarets station for two consecutive days. On the 29 April, Police Community Officers will hand out registration forms for you to complete these and bring back the following day, with your bike to hand to the Safer Transport Team officers who will then mark their bikes -- on 30 April 2014.
 
All you have to do is hand in the completed form and their cycle will be marked. This will give commuters a chance to have their cycles marked with minimal effort outside rush hour. You can also just turn up on the day, but there might be more of a wait.
