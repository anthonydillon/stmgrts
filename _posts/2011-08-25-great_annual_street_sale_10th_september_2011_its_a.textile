    There are times when the stuff that we accumulate around ourselves threatens to take over our lives. Bookshelves groan under the weight of unread books and CD racks creak with forgotten records. Cupboards are stuffed with things that we don't even know we had and wardrobes are hung with clothes that went out of fashion when David Bowie abandoned the 3 inch stack heel for lounge suits. What can we do? There are 3 possible solutions:-
    
    # Do nothing until the neighbours wonder, "Whatever happened to old so-and-so?" and our bodies are found buried under a mountain of David Cassidy albums, Dan Brown books and rusting Swiss Fondue sets.
    # Go out at midnight and stick it all into a neighbour's skip.
    # Take it all to GASS and sell it.

h3. What is GASS?

Somebody once said that the best ideas are the simplest ideas - and so it is with GASS - the Great Annual Street Sale which takes place on Saturday 10<sup>th</sup> September from 12.00 midday, in North St Margarets. For those who like to know these things GASS is organised by "NSMRA - the North St Margarets Residents Association":http://www.nsmra.co.uk/.

The idea is simplicity itself. Take a table, stick it out on the pavement, cover it with all those things that you no longer need - and then sell 'em. It is like a massive car boot sale but without the car - or the boot. The array of things up for grabs at bargain basement prices is vast, from toys, books, CD's, designer clothes and bric-a-brac at one end to home made cakes, jams, pickles, plants and Christmas cards at the other. Allotment owners will be selling fresh fruit and vegetables and All Souls Church is running a Caf&#233; with free refreshments. Even the local neighbourhood police team will be there marking bicycles. Last year GASS attracted so many stalls out onto the street they were, according to one resident, visible from aircraft flying into Heathrow!

Such is the success of GASS that this year the event is being opened up to people living outside the immediate NSMRA area. If you have a table and a load of junk - er, sorry, objects d'art - that you would like to sell please contact Laurence Mann at "laurence@alhughes.co.uk":mailto:laurence@alhughes.co.uk  Space is limited so please do not delay. This invitation to GASS is not open to commercial organisations of any size.

For those unhappy souls who rarely venture north to the other side of the A316, NSMRA represents the good folk living in Northcote, Haliburton, Newry, Talbot, Heron and St Margarets Roads. To find GASS, stroll up the St Margarets Road, the A3004, towards old Isleworth and turn left just past the Ailsa pub.  You have nothing to lose but your small change!
