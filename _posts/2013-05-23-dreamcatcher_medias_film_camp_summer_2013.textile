_Make a 5 minute film in 5 Days and take a copy home on DVD!_

Here at Dreamcatcher Media, the films made on our Summer Film Camps feature great heroes and anti-heroes, goodies and baddies, exciting chases and dramatic scenes - all scripted, filmed and directed by young people aged 8 - 16.

Our next 5 day Film Camp starts on 8<sup>th</sup> July. Children come up with their own idea for a film, then set about shooting, directing and editing it over the five days under expert tuition from industry professionals. It's all great fun but good learning too and young wannabee filmmakers finish the course equipped to make their own movies.

Sponsored by the Alpha Plus Group, the Camp takes place at Falcons Boys Prep School in Richmond and runs weekly from July 8<sup>th</sup> until August 30<sup>th</sup> starting at 9am. See website "www.dreamcatchermedia.co.uk":http://www.dreamcatchermedia.co.uk for other locations.

To Book, Call -  0208 8916414 or email "info@dreamcatchermedia.co.uk":mailto:info@dreamcatchermedia.co.uk.
