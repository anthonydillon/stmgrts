Hello there

I'm wondering if the community there could help me.

I'm trying to trace family of a Royal Navy pilot, James Graham Irvine who lost his life on September 7th 1944. He is listed as Son of James D. Irvine and Dorothy Irvine, of St Margarets, Middlesex. He was killed I understand while flying with a training unit in Scotland andwas buried in Arbroath, Scotland.

My interest is that I believe he served with 810 Squadron before his death and during this time was pilot of an aircraft which made an emergency landing in Ireland. A photo of him and his fellow crew men exists in a museum in the local area and I'd love to identify who everyone is in the picture.

I see that there are three Irvines listed in the phone book. I don't know what size the town is but would there be a historian or some one who might be able to help.

With best regards,
