For the past year Sussex artist, Katie Sollohub, has been a guest in JMW Turner's House, as artist in residence supported by Arts Council England.

Now she is to celebrate her many days working at Sandycombe Lodge and garden, with an exhibition of new drawings and paintings. With the title 'A Guest in Turner's House' the exhibition runs from 26<sup>th</sup> March to 25<sup>th</sup> May 2015 at The Stables Gallery, Orleans House Gallery, Twickenham TW1 3DJ. Entry is free.



Wrapped in the aura of England's great landscape painter, Katie has been inspired by the very close 'atmosphere of Turner' as she worked in the house's pre-restored state, focusing on the architectural character of Turner's design. The exhibition includes a series of impressive, bold 9ft paintings among some 40 exhibits. She has used oil paint and charcoal, and has prepared some of her surfaces with soil from Turner's garden, adding an authentic touch.

Katie's work is bold and painterly, and large-scale charcoal drawings are an important part of her practice. An experienced tutor of all ages, she has exhibited widely across the South of England. Last year two of her drawings were shortlisted for the prestigious Jerwood Drawing Prize and this year one of her Sandycombe Lodge paintings has been shortlisted for the Lynn Painter Stainers Prize.

"Turner would no doubt be delighted that his former home today inspires high-calibre artists such as Katie," said Catherine Parry-Wingfield, chair of Turner's House Trust.

Opening times for the Orleans House Gallery exhibition are from Tuesday to Sunday 10am to 5pm. For more information visit "www.richmond.gov.uk/home/services/arts/the_stables_gallery":http://www.richmond.gov.uk/home/services/arts/the_stables_gallery
