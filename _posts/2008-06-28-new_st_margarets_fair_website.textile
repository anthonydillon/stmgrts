From this week and throughout the year you can now find the St Margarets Fair at "www.stmargaretsfair.org":http://www.stmargaretsfair.org/.  On Saturday the 12<sup>th</sup> of July at 12pm the 30<sup>th</sup> Fair opens on its usual Moormead site.  It still continues to be the largest community and charity event in the area with over &pound;15000 shared between local schools and the charities last year.

To celebrate 30 years on Moormead, and in response to the feedback we had via last year's website survey, there will be two major differences.  We've negotiated with all the providers of the children's fairground rides to reduce their cost to 50% of last year's prices. Just as importantly we have a new provider of 'loos'.  This year there will be 28 individual unisex units, plus a disabled/baby change unit.  These will all be situated near the tennis courts just behind the cricket pavilion and will have an attendant looking after them all day.

We've always been very proud of the way we cope with litter during and after the event.  Over the past 3 years in conjunction with the LBRUT we've made extra special efforts to make the event as recycle friendly as possible.  This year we're putting even more effort in that direction, and as always we really do appreciate your on the day contribution to make the Fair as green an event as possible.

An added attraction this year comes from Twickenham Rowing Club with their dry land rowing machines and expertise.  You'll be able to try out your own rowing ability and then watch the finals of their local competition.

Any finally to really celebrate 30 years of the Fair we've had some limited edition high quality T-shirts especially produced.  There's just 200 of them and they will be available 'on the day' at the Information Tent for &pound;7 each for all sizes.  You can also buy them from the 1st of July at Cutters 28 Crown Road and Real Ale Limited 371 Richmond Road. All profits as usual go to the supported schools and charities.

For all the other Fair information and news you'll just need to follow this link "www.stmargaretsfair.org":http://www.stmargaretsfair.org/  Starting next year you'll also be able to book your stall online as well as over the phone.
