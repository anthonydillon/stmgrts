To date, with 160 people voting in our "informal CPZ poll":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/poll/CPZ/results, ~57% of you have said 'NO' to a CPZ in the Moormead and north of the A316 area (only ~37% said 'YES').  We also know of two non-web groups walking various streets collecting names of people who are against the CPZ, which we have not seen since the last Council elections.

While some might have predicted this, we did not.  We assumed that most people  would be for _anything_ that _might_ relieve some of the parking pressure (right or wrong).  It will be interesting to see what the actual survey results are.

Where you surprised?
