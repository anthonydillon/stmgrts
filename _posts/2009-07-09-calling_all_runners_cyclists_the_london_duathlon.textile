    Thank you to all those who have supported the St Margarets for "FRODO":http://www.frodokids.org campaign, from buying the cakes and the clothes to taking part in the London Duathlon.  We are well on the way to raising the &pound;25,000 to send a team of doctors from Gt Ormond St to Romania to treat 50 plus disabled and orphaned children.  Last year a team from St Margarets took part in the London Duathlon, raising over &pound;5,000.

Thank you to all those who have supported the St Margarets for "FRODO":http://www.frodokids.org campaign, from buying the cakes and the clothes to taking part in the London Duathlon.  We are well on the way to raising the &pound;25,000 to send a team of doctors from Gt Ormond St to Romania to treat 50 plus disabled and orphaned children.  Last year a team from St Margarets took part in the London Duathlon, raising over &pound;5,000.

This year we want to get the largest charity team together to see if we can double it.  We would love anyone who can run 5k, or cycle to come and join us.  It is also a great day out for the family.

To join or find out more please call Claire Wilson on 020 8744 0700.
