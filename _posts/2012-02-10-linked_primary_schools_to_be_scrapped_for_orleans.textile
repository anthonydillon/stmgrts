As expected, the February 6 meeting of the Richmond Upon Thames Admissions Forum decided (9 to 2, 4 abstentions) to recommend "that Cabinet should approve the proposal to remove the links" for September 2013 admissions and beyond, affecting current year five and below. 

This will make places at Orleans Park available to the East Twickenham children who attend the Vineyard school and Catholic schools. No-one can say how far the catchment area will extend northwards into north St Margaret's; one forecast is "Pupils who were at one of the former link schools but live more than about 1.5 km away [will] definitely not get into OPS"
