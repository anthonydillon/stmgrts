The fight against alcohol and drugs misuse will be highlighted at a "seminar in York House":http://stmgrts.org.uk/event/Meeting/200611290308 on 12 December. 

The event is being organised by the Richmond upon Thames Community Safety Partnership, a crime fighting alliance comprising Richmond Council, the police and numerous other agencies.



It follows hot on the heels of a similar event, organised by the CSP, to discuss anti-social behaviour.

The Council's Cabinet Member for Communities, Sir David Williams,
said:

"The event will discuss issues around alcohol and drugs in the borough, what the partnership is doing to counter them, and come up with fresh ideas aimed at further reducing the problems.

"The scourge of alcohol and drugs misuse is one we are determined to combat in partnership with other agencies and we are keen to hear the views of residents, community groups and other interested parties on this important issue."

Speakers at the event will include David MacIntosh, policy adviser at the London Drug Policy Forum, who will chair the morning session. Other experts in the field will give presentations on the local and national picture concering drugs and alcohol misuse. Information about the different types of illegal drugs and the harm they cause will also be given.

In the afternoon subjects covered will include Young People and Substance Misuse, The Licensing Act One Year On, and Policing Drugs and Alcohol.

The event is open to all professionals and frontline staff from any agency or voluntary group as well as community groups and individual local residents. 

Anyone wishing to attend should book a place in advance by calling the Community Safety Partnership on 020 8891 7777 or email "community.safety@richmond.gov.uk":mailto:community.safety@richmond.gov.uk
