Sometime in the next month, double yellow lines will be added to the junctions of Winchester Road near St Stephen's CE Junior School.  Hopefully this will remove many of the dangerously parked cars which make it difficult for children to safely cross the street.

There will also be a consultation about pedestrianizing Winchester Road from the Turks Head to the end of Winchester, near the A316.

Additionaly, the school is appealing to parents to stop parking on the yellow zig-zag lines outside the school, these are in place to enhance children's safty, not for parents to pick up and drop off..  This is illegal and the school as arranged for the police and traffic wardens to help fine cars who do stop.
