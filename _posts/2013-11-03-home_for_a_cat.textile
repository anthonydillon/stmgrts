For our very pretty 10 year old female tabby cat.

Maddy is a timid cat and would best suit an experienced cat owner. She would really prefer not to have to share her owners with other cats, dogs or young children. She would love a garden to sunbathe in. Maddy loves to have the company of her owners and be stroked and be made a fuss off. She is fully house trained and is very good in the house and has never done anything naughty in the home. Maddy has never been ill and is fighting fit. She has recently had all her inoculations and neutered.

Maddy is only looking for a new home due to her owners personal situation.

If you could give Maddy a home please call Kate - 07769974428

Based in St Margarets
