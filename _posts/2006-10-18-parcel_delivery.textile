A card is posted through your door from a company called PDS (Parcel Delivery Service) suggesting that they were unable to deliver a parcel and that you need to contact them on 0906 6611911 (a premium rate number). DO NOT call this number as this is a mail scam originating from Belize.

If you call this number and you start to hear a recorded message you will already have been billed Â£15 for the phone call.

If you do receive a card with these details, then please contact Royal Mail Fraud on 0207 239 6655 or ICTIS (the premium rate service regulator) at "www.icstis.org.uk":http://www.icstis.org.uk or your local trading standards office.

*This is a genuine scam.*

This service is under investigation by ICSTIS. Please be aware of this scam and forward this information to as many as possible.
