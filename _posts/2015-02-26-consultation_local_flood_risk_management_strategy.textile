Under the Flood and Water Management Act 2010 the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames was designated as a Lead Local Flood Authority (LLFA) with responsibilities for managing local flood risk across the borough. The primary duties of a LLFA are to ensure that flood risks from surface water runoff, groundwater and ordinary watercourses are identified and managed appropriately.

To meet this requirement a Local Flood Risk Management Strategy (LFRMS) has been produced to ensure that flood risks across the borough are managed in a coordinated way, balancing the needs of communities, the economy and the environment. The LFRMS has been informed by the results of a community engagement survey undertaken in early 2014; residents' responses about their understanding and experiences of flooding across the borough have been taken into account in the production of the LFRMS.



The key objectives of the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames's 5-year LFRMS are to:

* Encourage direct involvement in decision making through the establishment of and maintaining partnerships with key organisations, including the Environment Agency and Thames Water
* Improve our knowledge and understanding of the interactions between different sources of flooding in Richmond Borough
* Encourage residents, businesses and local landowners to take action and contribute to the management and reduction of flood risk
* Target resources where they have the greatest effect by adopting a risk-based approach
* Contribute to wider social, economic and environmental outcomes by encouraging sustainable multi-benefit solutions for the management of local flood risk

We are now seeking the views of residents, groups and businesses on our draft Local Flood Risk Management Strategy (LFRMS). The responses provided from this consultation will help shape the final Strategy document, which will be implemented to manage flood risk across the borough.

_The closing date for the consultation is Friday 6<sup>th</sup> March 2015._
