I should be most grateful if you could publicize the fact that the Richmond Furniture Scheme a charity (1133019) based in 1a Fortescue Avenue, Twickenham TW2 5LS has extended its opening times and is now open from Mondays to Fridays 10.00 - 1500 and on the first Saturday of every month from 1000 to 1200. We sell reused furniture.

We are part of the newly launched Re-Ward Scheme that gives members rewards when they have items repaired, hire a household item, shop in a charity shop, buy second-hand or buy recycled products. Anything, in fact, that gives a new lease of life to something they already own or that someone else has owned and loved. If people join up they can start earning tokens toward their &pound;5 voucher which they can spend with any of the Re-ward Club partners! If anyone is interested they can go "www.re-ward.me":http://www.re-ward.me/
