At HANDS (Help a neighbour in distress) we are planning to hold a _Baby & Child clothing sale_. We are therefore looking for donations of Pre-loved, good quality child & baby clothing.

Donations can be dropped to HANDS, Bath House, Twickenham, TW1 3DX between 9.30 and 12.30 or to Petit Bateau, 56 High Street, Richmond-upon-Thames, TW9 1TW (To discuss the possibility of a local collection please phone Maxine - 07719938889).

All money raised will go towards running costs of the Help a Neighbour in Distress Scheme. 'HANDS' aims to improve the quality of life for people living in the areas of Twickenham & St Margarets by giving friendly, practical help to those in need (Charity No. 1033694).
