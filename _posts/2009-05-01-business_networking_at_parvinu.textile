We are delighted to say that we have become a popular destination for Business Networking communities. We have hosted several evenings that have proved very popular and attended by representatives from companies small and large, all benefitting from the easy and informal atmosphere that Parvinu provides.

The most successful event was held by "The Best of Richmond":http://www.thebestof.co.uk/local/richmond -- the largest and best-supported organisation supporting businesses in the Borough of Richmond.

We were pleased to support another St Margarets business on the evening, "The Yellow Wedge Cheese Shop":http://www.yellowwedge.com They put on a great display of their delicious artisan cheeses for guests to sample and we helped things along by providing a selection of wines to taste which our wine expert chose to match the stunning fare offered by the guys at Yellow Wedge.

They are coming back soon to hold their own evening at Parvinu, so we suggest you visit their Crown Road shop and find out more.
