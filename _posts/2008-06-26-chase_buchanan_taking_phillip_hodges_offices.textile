Chase Buchanan are delighted to announce that we've secured larger premises in St Margarets Village, for our expanding Sales and Lettings office. 

Our fellow Estate Agents at Phillip Hodges are relocating, and no longer require their premises at 124 St Margarets Road.  This has created an opportunity for us to move across the road, with minimal upheaval.  We have been keen to find a larger office in St Margarets for some time and this prominent site, opposite St Margarets station, is ideal. We are sure this will enable us to continue to work effectively in a comfortable environment.     

We will commence refurbishing our new sales and lettings office very soon, with the aim of opening in early September.

If you have any queries please contact Michael Peacock on 020 8744 2434 or e-mail to "m.peacock@chasebuchanan.co.uk":mailto:m.peacock@chasebuchanan.co.uk.
