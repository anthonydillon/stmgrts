If anyone has had problems getting a school space in recent years and would like to interviewed, a journalist from ITV has contacted me asking references for "a story tonight on the pressure on primary school places in South West London".

Email me at "peter@stmgrts.org.uk":mailto:peter@stmgrts.org.uk and I will put you in touch.
