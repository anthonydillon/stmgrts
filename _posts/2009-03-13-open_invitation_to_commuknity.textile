Commuknity is a group of knitters and crocheters, beginners and old hands, who have decided to get together over a glass or two of wine for a knit and a natter.  We meet in the St Margarets on the first and third Mondays of the month.  The next session is on Monday 16<sup>th</sup> March from 8pm.

Anybody is welcome, we'd love to see you there.  For more info, email "commuknity@hotmail.co.uk":mailto:commuknity@hotmail.co.uk
