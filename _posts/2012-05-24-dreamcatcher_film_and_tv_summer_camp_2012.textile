Students who enroll for our one week course will receive all the fundamental instruction they need to get to grips with completing a short film. We take students aged 7 to 17 and children are put in age appropriate groups. We have a young, middle and older group. Classes run from 9am to 2pm each day.

Each week students will complete a number of practical projects to test the new skills they have acquired. These skills include

* Production planning
* Storyboarding
* Directing
* Presenting
* Lighting
* Sound
* Script writing
* Set/props/special effects

Students shoot on digital video cameras and play each of the working roles on a short TV film production.

Every year we also work with our colleagues and contacts in the industry and each week try to set up a trip to places like ITV London Studios, SKY, Pinewood and other locations.  Similarily with guest speakers who have achieved enormous success in the film and television industries, we will endeavour to set up some talks at the Camp and students will have the opportunity to learn from their achievements.
