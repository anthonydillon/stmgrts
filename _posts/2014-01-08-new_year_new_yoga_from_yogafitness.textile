Why not give your New Year's resolutions a yoga focus this year with either, the brand new, 'IMPROVING BEGINNERS' - a five week course, designed specifically for the beginner who has some previous experience, already knows some of the basics and wants to deepen their knowledge and practice further or 'COMPLETE BEGINNERS' - a set of five week courses, designed for those with no previous experience and who want an introduction into the world of Yoga. The main emphasis will be on learning key Yoga poses and sequences, as well as looking at basic breathing and relaxation techniques.



IMPROVING BEGINNERS meets on Tuesday nights 7:15pm - 8:30pm, 14<sup>th</sup> Jan - 11<sup>th</sup> Feb at great new venue, Gymboree, St Margarets and COMPLETE BEGINNERS meets throughout 2014, starting January 12<sup>th</sup>, Sunday evenings at ETNA Community Centre.

If that's not enough to get you on the yoga mat to kick start 2014, perhaps the weekly, 'DYNAMIC YOGA CLASS' will. For experienced beginners/intermediates, on Sunday evenings from 6:45pm - 8pm at ETNA Community Centre, East Twickenham.

Here's what some previous students think:

bq. 'Sammie makes you feel as though you are getting one to one tuition even in a full class. The Complete Beginners Course is a great introduction to yoga and you can take it at your own pace. Highly recommended'

??BERNADETTE FULLER, DECEMBER 2013??

bq. 'Learning yoga from Yoga-Fitness has been wonderful. Sammie's clear and helpful instruction makes the class enjoyable and relaxing. Her watchful yet warm teaching style is reassuring - especially as a beginner when learning the positions.'

??AS, ST MARGARETS, NOV 2012??

bq. 'I always look forward to Sunday night Yoga-Fitness, Sammie is a fabulous teacher and the classes are not only great for body toning and strengthening but also informative and very relaxing! I leave each week feeling refreshed and ready for the week ahead! I would recommend Yoga-Fitness to anyone who wants to learn yoga in a fun and friendly environment!'
