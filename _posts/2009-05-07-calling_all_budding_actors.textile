Local actor/film director Alister Cameron is making a short film this week and needs *EXTRAS*.

If you're interested in appearing in the film please turn up at the car park at York House at 2pm on Thursday 14<sup>th</sup> May. There's no fee but you will get to hear some music and watch some dancing and be part of a local film. 

Thanks - see you there.
