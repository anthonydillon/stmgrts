Residents concerned about the state of roads and footpaths in their local area can now nominate them for repair.

As part of the Council's drive to improve the environment of the borough and after listening to comments from its 'All in One' consultation, an annual community road and pavement funding pot of &pound;35,000 has been made available for highway maintenance in each of the fourteen village areas in the borough. This sum (in total &pound;490,000) is in addition to the maintenance work being carried out by the Council, and each year local residents will be invited to suggest how the money should be spent in their area.
