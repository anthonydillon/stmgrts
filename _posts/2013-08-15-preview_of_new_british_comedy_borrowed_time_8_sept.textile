_open-air cinema in the grounds of Strawberry Hill House_

Jules Bishop's feature debut is a precious rarity: an independent, low-budget British take on urban youth devoid of clich&#233; or cynicism. It's a nuanced character study centred on the unlikely relationship between hapless young burglar Kevin (a remarkable Theo Barklem-Biggs) and his eccentric old curmudgeon of a victim Philip (Phil Davis). Bishop proves a deft judge of tone, striking a balance of wit and whimsy that only tips slightly into parody with Kevin's cartoonish tormenter, the drug-dealing Ninja Nigel (Warren Brown). Still, first time out, the writer/director looks a very exciting prospect.

There is a chance to meet the actors, director and producers on the night and Strawberry Hill House will be open until 7.00 for tours as an added attraction.
