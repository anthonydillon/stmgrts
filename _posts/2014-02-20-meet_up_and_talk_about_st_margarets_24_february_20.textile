Readers who are interested in what goes on in St Margarets are invited to join an informal, but structured gathering at St Margarets Tavern on Monday, from 6.30 to 8pm.

A few locals have shown an interest in putting ideas forward for improving the local area. They want to hear from more local residents that want to be part of the conversation.

In the future the group can look at different things, from organising events in the area, to informing local village plans. If you have an idea for improving the area, take it along.

Details and the chance to register interest can be found here: http://meetu.ps/2bNQbK
