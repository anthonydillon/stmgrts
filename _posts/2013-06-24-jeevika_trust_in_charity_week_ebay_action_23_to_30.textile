_Local charity Jeevika Trust takes part in national auction with Bollywood gifts_

A Surrey charity is staging an auction to help India's rural poor - with a little help from Bollywood and from one of Britain's best gardeners.

Jeevika Trust, which is based in Hampton Wick, is participating in the annual Small Charity Week eBay auction from 20 to 30 June to help raise vital funds.

A leading Bollywood production company, Eros International - which distributes Bollywood films to over 50 countries worldwide - has kindly donated to us an exciting package for you to bid for. The package includes a boxset of Bollywood hits and a one year subscription to the company's films online worth &pound;72 - as well as a poster of YEH JEEVANI HAI DEEWANI autographed by its leading star, Deepika Padukone.  We are proud to be supported by a woman famous for her roles depicting independent women in films including 'Cocktail' which was a smash hit commercially and with critics alike.

Leading UK gardener Cleve West, winner of seven medals at the RHS Chelsea Flower Show and a long term Jeevika Trust supporter, has also made a donation. Auction participants can bid for a hardback signed copy of his bestselling book Our Plot, which also features Cleve's beautiful illustrations. A limited edition pen and ink glicee print of one of his 'Mutant Roots' - Cleve's beautiful fantasy illustrations of strange and magical vegetables - is also up for grabs.

The Small Charity Week eBay auction is a national event raising funds for numerous small charities across the UK.

Becky Buchanan of Jeevika Trust, said: "We are a small charity that makes a big difference in the communities that we support in rural India. The media focuses on India the superpower. But rural India remains the world's biggest poverty trap.  For every &pound;1 we make, &pound;3 is generated for the villages we work with. That's why this Small Charity Week auction is such a great opportunity. Thanks so much to Eros International, and to one of Britain's favourite gardeners, Cleve West, for their continued support."
