TALES of cuckolded molecatchers, a lone oak tree that grows at Gallipoli, care in the community and medieval pilgrims - there's clearly going to be no shortage of talking points at a show in Twickenham this week!

One of Britain's most respected folk and acoustic music clubs, Twickfolk has been bringing great live sounds to the South West of London for more than 30 years. However, the arrival of folk experimentalists and multi-instrumentalists Harp and a Monkey will be a first for both parties.

Regulars on the festival circuit and counting the likes of Radio 2's Mark Radcliffe and Steve Lamacq among their flag bearers, the trio from Lancashire have been gaining a reputation as one of the UK's leading purveyors of accessible left-field folk. Despite this, they have never played a solo show in London before.

Martin Purdy, the band's front-man and a historian and author whose titles have included offerings for the BBC's Who Do You Think You Are? franchise, explained: 


bq.. "We perform a mixture of traditional and original material that often takes the form of short stories set to song. That is how we come to be singing about such varied things as the Spanish Civil War, cheated brides, Rosa Parks and Joan of Arc.

"It is really exciting to finally be playing a solo show in London and we promise those who come some great melodies, poignancy and laughter."


p. Formed in 2008, Harp and a Monkey have released two critically acclaimed albums, with their latest, All Life Is Here, among the folk albums of the year of such luminaries as Mike Harding, FolkRadioUK and The Daily Telegraph. They also pride themselves on never having played anywhere and not having been invited back.

The performance at Twickfolk, @ The Cabbage Patch Pub, 67 London Road, Twickenham TW1 3SZ, is on Sunday, April 19, and entry is &pound;8 in advance or &pound;10 on the door. Doors open at 7.45pm.
