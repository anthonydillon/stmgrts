I have very recently moved to the lovely St Margarets and have been setting up a new business over 2008. 

I am a makup artist and work in fashion, tv and music. My business partner and I have set up a business called SLAP! We our on a mission to educate women on how to look amazing by teaching them how we as artists work. We are promoting our business and have started to build it up.

_For anyone that hears about us through the letter will receive 25% off any booking._

We teach from home or go to peoples houses. We do everything from one to ones to parties for teenagers, _yummy mummys_, _done and divorced_ ... the list is endless. 

We have worked with A-list celebrities such as Sienna Miller, David Beckham, Nigella Lawson to name a few.  Please see below for more information on us and what we do...
