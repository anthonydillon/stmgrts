Corks will be popping at one of South London's fastest growing independent wine merchants when "The Good Wine Shop":http://stmgrts.org.uk/directory/wine_aNd_spirits/200511281416 in St Margarets hosts a special "Spring wine tasting event":http://stmgrts.org.uk/event/Exhibition/200704050632.

A selection of up to 50 Spring and Summer wines will be on offer for guests to sample during the event which takes place at Winchester Hall in St Margarets on Saturday 28th April, 12.00pm to 4.00pm.



Owner Mark Wrigglesworth will be on hand to help guests decipher their Rioja from their Riesling and offer expert tips and advice on choosing the best wines for all occasions. Guests will also be able to enjoy a range of carefully selected breads and cheeses to compliment the wines.

Mark said: "We believe wine is all about enjoyment. There can be a certain snobbery surrounding wines but at The Good Wine Shop we aim to break down those barriers, offering the finest vintages from the world's best small producers, which wouldn't normally be found on the high street."

The Good Wine Shop was established six years ago and since Mark took over in 2004, the emphasis has been as much on personal service as on selling excellent wines.

"We are looking to offer quality, original wines that are value for money. But individual tastes differ vastly and a wine that is enjoyed by one person may not be to the taste of another. By getting to know our customers personally we can actively seek out wines to suit their particular palate." added Mark.

Special "double" discounts on mixed cases will be available at the event. Tickets can be purchased from The Good Wine Shop in advance at a cost of &pound;7.50 per person or &pound;10.00 on the door.
