Every Sunday 5:30-6:45pm at Quest Fitness with Cassie. Join me for yoga in this new private gym, 11 Campbell Road, TW2 for small group yoga classes - all levels welcome. Yoga is great for building strength and flexibility in the body whilst releasing stress and calming the mind.

I have been practising yoga for 7 years, and am a certified British Wheel of Yoga teacher - I teach safe alignment and integrate all aspects of yoga for well-rounded, physically energising, mentally relaxing and enjoyable classes

If you'd like to book to come to a class or find out more please contact me on "info@quest-fitness.co.uk":mailto:info@quest-fitness.co.uk or "cassieisherwood@hotmail.com":mailto:cassieisherwood@hotmail.com
Summer Offer for July & August is &pound;9 per class or 4 classes for &pound;32.
