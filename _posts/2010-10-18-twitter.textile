    Starting today, we are starting a _St Margarets Community Website_ twitter account at "@stmgrts":http://twitter.com/#!/stmgrts.  We will be attempting to publish a tweet or two most days, nothing too onerous, about news and events in St Margarets.
    
    If you are interested, please follow us and perhaps we can even retweet your stuff.
