Unless it's an emergency, call the Metropolitan Police Service on 0300 123 1212.

You now only need to know two numbers to contact the Metropolitan Police:

In an emergency always call 999.

An emergency is when a crime is happening, someone suspected of a crime is nearby, someone is injured, being threatened or in danger.

For example:

* If your house is being burgled (or the suspect is nearby) call 999
* If your car is being stolen (or the suspect is nearby) call 999

Call 0300 123 1212 when you need to report crime that is not an emergency.

For example:

* If your house has been burgled call 0300 123 1212
* If your car has been stolen call 0300 123 1212

This number has been introduced to make it simpler for you to contact us and to help reduce the amount of inappropriate 999 calls. You can call it any time, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Local call charges apply from BT lines in London. Mobiles and other networks may vary.

You can also call 0300 123 1212 when you need to speak to your local police, seek advice on police matters or comment on the service you have received from the Metropolitan Police. If you are deaf or have speech impairment you can use a textphone to call us. Dial 18000 in an emergency, or 18001 if your call is not an emergency.

Our operators have access to professional interpreters so they can quickly translate your call if you cannot, or have difficulty, speaking English.
