"We Can Do It!":https://stmargarets.london/event/auction/200705144364 This is an original musical theatre production about life in Isleworth and the surrounding areas of Twickenham and Richmond during the 2<sup>nd</sup> World War and how people coped. It features a cast of over 60 actors, singers and dancers drawn from the community, spanning in age from 6 to 79.

The play traces the lives of 5 local people, some still living in the community and we include Barnes Wallace, Amy Gentry, champion rower, and Brendan Finucane, ace Spitfire Pilot.

Much of our focus is on how single mothers coped with raising their families and taking on the jobs of men who were drafted away, hence the title.
