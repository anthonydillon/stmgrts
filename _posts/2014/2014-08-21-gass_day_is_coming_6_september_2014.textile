    There are times when the stuff that we accumulate around ourselves threatens to take over our lives. Shelves groan under the weight of unread books and record racks creak with unplayed CDs. Cupboards are stuffed with things that we don't even know we had and wardrobes are hung with clothes that went out of fashion when David Bowie abandoned the 3 inch stack heel for lounge suits. What can we do about it all?

There are times when the stuff that we accumulate around ourselves threatens to take over our lives. Shelves groan under the weight of unread books and record racks creak with unplayed CDs. Cupboards are stuffed with things that we don't even know we had and wardrobes are hung with clothes that went out of fashion when David Bowie abandoned the 3 inch stack heel for lounge suits. What can we do about it all? There are 3 possible solutions:

# Do nothing until the neighbours wonder, "Whatever happened to old so-and-so?" and our bodies are found buried under a mountain of David Cassidy albums, Dan Brown books and rusting Swiss Fondue sets.
# Take everything to your local charity shop
# Take it all to GASS and sell it.




h4. What Is GASS?

Somebody once said that the best ideas are the simplest ideas - and so it is with GASS - the Great Annual Street Sale which takes place in North St Margarets on Saturday 6<sup>th</sup> September from 12.00 noon - 3.00pm.

The idea is what some people like to call a "no-brainer". Take a table, stick it out on the pavement, cover it with all those things that you no longer need - and then sell them. It is like a massive car boot sale but without the car - or the boot. The array of things up for grabs at bargain basement prices is vast, from toys, books, CD's, designer clothes and bric-a-brac at one end to home-made cakes, jams, pickles, plants and Christmas cards at the other. Allotment owners will be selling fresh fruit and vegetables; All Souls Church is running a Cafe and Fair Trade stall and there will also be a Hamburger joint cum Indian food stall for hungry shoppers. Last year GASS attracted so many stalls out onto the street they were, according to one resident, visible from aircraft flying into Heathrow!

Such is the success of GASS that the event is now open to people living outside the immediate area. If you have a table and a load of junk - er, sorry, objects d'art - that you would like to sell please contact Laurence Mann at "laurence@alhughes.co.uk":mailto:laurence@alhughes.co.uk or Martyn on 0208 892 5211. Space is limited so please do not delay. The cost per stall is &pound;2 for residents and &pound;5 for others. This invitation to GASS is not open to commercial organisations of any size.

For those who like to know these things GASS is organised by NSMRA - the North St Margarets Residents Association. For those unhappy souls who rarely venture north to the other side of the A316, NSMRA represents the good folk living in Northcote, Haliburton, Newry, Talbot, Heron and St Margarets Roads. To find GASS, stroll up the St Margarets Road, the A3004, towards old Isleworth and turn left just past the Ailsa pub.
