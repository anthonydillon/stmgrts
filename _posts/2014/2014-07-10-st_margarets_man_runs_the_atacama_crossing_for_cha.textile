Paul Smith, of London, and Ross Jackson, of St Margarets, both 35 years old, are competing in the Atacama Crossing in Chile for Prostate Cancer UK.

Paul and Ross are hoping to raise over &pound;25,000 by running the Atacama Crossing (6 marathons in 6 days, self-supported, across the Atacama Desert in Chile) in October this year to help the charity to continue supporting the 250,000 men living with prostate cancer in the UK.


Paul and Ross were inspired to take on the challenge for Prostate Cancer UK after Ross's father sadly passed away last year from the disease. They said: "We've always wanted to take part in the Atacama Crossing and after Ross's father, Gordon, passed away last year we wanted to take the opportunity to support Prostate Cancer UK"


bq. "We are really looking forward to the challenge - 6 marathons in 6 days, carrying all our own kit, across the world's driest and highest desert.  It's going to be incredibly tough but we're aiming to finish in the top 10.  We are delighted to be raising awareness and much needed money to help the fight against prostate cancer."


Mark Bishop, Director of Fundraising at Prostate Cancer UK, said: 

bq.. "We're thrilled that Paul and Ross have decided to take on this challenge to raise funds for Prostate Cancer UK. It is with support like this that we can help provide dedicated support and information to men and their families affected by prostate cancer and fund research to help fight the disease.

"With over 40,000 men diagnosed with prostate cancer each year in the UK and one man dying every hour, it is our aim to help more men survive the disease and enjoy a better quality of life. We wish Paul and Ross every success with their challenge."


p. Prostate Cancer UK is currently engaged in its high profile 'Men United v Prostate Cancer' campaign, which aims to build a united front of men against the disease.  Homeland star Damian Lewis, Game of Thrones hard man Charles Dance, Sir Michael Parkinson and rugby legend Will Carling - some of Britain's most iconic figures - have already signed for Men United, a unique team 'managed' by comedian Bill Bailey.
