[The Big Dance Bus is back to get everyone dancing at Twickenham Green this summer!](/event/event/200705144500)

Last seen in the borough in 2012, this quirky double-decker bus pulls up with its own dance-floor, pumping sound system, compere, DJ and professional touring dance company, turning into a pop-up ballroom and ready made rave.

The Big Dance Bus hosts its own resident dance company, who will present a show stopping number filled with a number of styles including street, swing, tango, dancehall, breaking, folk and bollywood. Come and experience spectacular performances by the professional dancers, as well as by local dance groups from across the borough.

The Big Dance Bus is taking dance back to the streets. There will be plenty of opportunity for everyone to take part with free workshops in street dance, lindy hop and hula, with a social jam at the end for everyone to throw down some moves and shapes.

The Big Dance Bus is a free outdoor party suitable for all the family.

Come and join the ultimate celebration of dance!
