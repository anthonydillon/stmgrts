Horace Walpole's castle in Twickenham, Middlesex will be the scene for a week of seriously spooky Halloween activities for children and adults from 25 October to 31 October 2014.

The villa is the perfect setting for a week of Halloween activities with its Gothic revival architecture and history and the exciting programme is supported by Twickenham based, Milestone & Collis.

Mysterious and spooky workshops will be held for children including last year's sell-out Confusing Concoctions Workshop on 29 and 31 October from 1pm. Colourful liquids and a spell book will be just two of the tools on hand to help the children create their own magic potion and befuddle their friends.



Young wizards and witches who are under 5 years can take part in the special Pointy Hats workshop on 29 and 31 October from 11am.

On 30 and 31 October, children will have a chance to make their own scary Halloween masks in the Monstrous Masks workshop before embarking on a spooky tour of the house led by popular local drama group, Dragon Drama.

For parents and adults, a traditional Agatha Christie style murder set in the 1930s will be held at Strawberry Hill on 25 October from 7pm.  Guests will have a chance to interview suspects in the gothic surroundings of Strawberry Hill House and test their detective skills over a three course meal in the Waldegrave Suite at St Mary' University College.  This is the first time this event has been staged by Strawberry Hill and guests are invited to dress in 1920/30s costumes to enjoy this exclusive event.

Nick Smith, Director at Strawberry Hill said, "This is the second time Milestone & Collis has supported Strawberry Hill and we appreciate their support as it has enabled us to stage a very special week of Halloween activities for children and adults.  Make sure you do not miss out on the fun at Strawberry Hill in October."

"We are really pleased to lend our support to Strawberry Hill for the exciting Halloween week which includes the fantastic Murder Mystery evening.  There really is something for all both children and adults and it is certainly one week to make a date of in the diary!", said Antony Robson, Managing Director of Milestone & Collis, Twickenham.
