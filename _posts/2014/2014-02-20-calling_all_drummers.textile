_St Margarets' Elastic Band needs a drummer, percussionist/timpanist_

They need to have good reading skills and a set of drums/percussion and access to timpani would be useful too!

The band has a busy schedule of events this year  including a charity fund raising concert on April 15 (for the St Margarets' Fair), the Richmond May Fair, St Margarets' Fair in July and Remembrance Sunday in November and will be going to Fontainebleau again next year as part of the twinning/jumelage programme.



There must be someone out there!

If you are interested, please contact Geoff Varrall on:
