excerpt: |
    Please help look for Alice Gross, age 14, from Hanwell. She was last heard from at 3.00pm 28 August 2014, and doesn't have her Oyster card, keys or card. Her phone is off and she hasn't been with her friends that we are aware of. She is very vulnerable and we are all really worried about her. She's wearing blue jeans and a dark green knitted cardigan.
