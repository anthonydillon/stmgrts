    As a part of our Borough wide programme to improve roads and pavements we will be carrying out footway maintenance works in Hill View Road, Twickenham. The works will generally consist of re-laying defective kerbs and footway surface repairs. 
    
    We also intend to widen the pavement on the southside of the road from the bridge to the junction of Moor Mead Road to allow for easier pedestrian access due to the tree roots which have caused the pavement to become uneven.

As a part of our Borough wide programme to improve roads and pavements we will be carrying out footway maintenance works in Hill View Road, Twickenham. The works will generally consist of re-laying defective kerbs and footway surface repairs.

We also intend to widen the pavement on the southside of the road from the bridge to the junction of Moor Mead Road to allow for easier pedestrian access due to the tree roots which have caused the pavement to become uneven. These works will be carried out by our appointed contractor, F M Conway Ltd.

The works will start week commencing 15th September 2014, between 8am and 5pm and are expected to be completed within 11 weeks.

In order to facilitate the above works it will be necessary to impose some temporary parking restrictions in the road. The restricted length will be adequately marked with high visibility cones. Please do not park in 'No Waiting' coned area as parked vehicles can delay the progress and incur additional costs to the Council.
