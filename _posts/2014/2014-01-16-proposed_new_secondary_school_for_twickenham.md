Over the past two years Richmond Council has been working with Richmond upon Thames College on a project to create a new purpose built college, new special school and brand new secondary school for the borough at the Egerton Road site in Twickenham.

Recently this prospect has developed into an exciting proposal to create a brand new campus of Education and Enterprise, working in partnership with The Haymarket Media Group to create their new headquarters on the site. All the partners will also work together to help shape the curriculum and educational opportunities for the secondary school. Harlequins Rugby Club, a neighbour of the current College, has committed to support this proposal, along with Waldegrave School.

This unique proposition will bring together the education of our young people, both at the college and the new schools, with those who are leading the way nationally in media, technology and sport, assisting their future in education and employment.

Many people might query why and if we need a new secondary school in the borough. Secondary schools in Richmond upon Thames have never been better. Eighty five per cent of pupils are achieving five or more A\*-C grades and the English Baccalaureate results are the second highest in the country. As a result of these high standards, local schools are becoming more popular. The Council has always acknowledged this and knows that in 2017 there will be a need for more secondary school places.

This new secondary school would be for 11 to 16 year-olds, with the Sixth Form being provided at the College. The school would be co-educational, non-selective and non-faith and would admit five forms of entry (150 children) per year.

In order to realise the secondary school aspect of this project the lead partners have begun work on the preparation of an application to open a Free School from September 2017.

The proposal is at a very early stage, and we are inviting people to find out more about the project and if they think it is a good idea, to register their support.
