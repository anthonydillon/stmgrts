A free Wi-Fi service was introduced in Richmond borough libraries early in 2014.

Richmond Council is conducting a survey, designed to gather feedback from library users, gauge satisfaction with the Wi-Fi service and alert them to any issues they need to address for the future.

If you use Richmond upon Thames libraries please "complete the short survey before 7 December 2014":https://consultation.richmond.gov.uk/libraries/wifi/consult_view.
