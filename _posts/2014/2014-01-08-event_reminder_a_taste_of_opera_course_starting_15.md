Glyn Paul will take you on a lighthearted, guided tour through the development of opera, illustrated with a variety of recent and historic audio and video recordings. The 10 week course is a discussion group so you don't need to have a wide knowledge of opera to take part, just an interest in learning more.

The next 10 week course starts on Wednesday, 15<sup>th</sup> January 2014 and costs Â£80 for the 10 weeks.
