    bq. I will be setting off around the east and south coasts of England in Spring 2015  to paint at the locations chosen by Turner for his Ports and Harbours of England series. This will take me from Yorkshire to Cornwall in 15 steps, stopping at the some of the most famous towns in English maritime history.

bq.. I will be setting off around the east and south coasts of England in Spring 2015  to paint at the locations chosen by Turner for his Ports and Harbours of England series. This will take me from Yorkshire to Cornwall in 15 steps, stopping at the some of the most famous towns in English maritime history.

As well as the travel between locations, around 1000 miles by road on the motorbike, staying at each spot for  a week to get the pictures under way, for which I hope to get out onto the water to paint some of these views, I need to book accommodation, arrange promotion and book the venue for the final show after it is all over. So this where I need your support...

"My Indiegogo site":https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/in-the-footsteps-of-turner/x/8942803 allows you to see the video that I've posted about the trip, the background information about me and my work and also lists the perks that will be yours, if you are able to help me out financially - like the rest of the Indiegogo site, these perks will be updated regularly and I will let you know how things proceed over the next 6 weeks.

I've tried to set levels that will allow everyone contribute if they are interested, even with limited funds - if you have any suggestions or would like more information, please get in touch at this address.

If you can't afford it, but know someone else that might be interested please pass on the details or the links to this site - it'll all be over by Christmas, after all, so do let them know soonest!

A big thank-you in advance to everyone who has helped keep me afloat for over a decade by buying my work!

(As I set sail on this latest course, I'll try and cut out the nautical metaphors - they just stick to you like limpets when you're doing this stuff!)
