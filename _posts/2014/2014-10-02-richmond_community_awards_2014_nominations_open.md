Residents who live, work or study in the borough and work tirelessly to help improve the quality of lives for others will once again be rewarded via the Council's annual local 'honours' scheme - the Richmond Community Awards.

Any resident or local group/organisation can make a nomination online, or by picking up a form from a local library or the Civic Centre.

Once the nominations are in, a panel of Council officers, chaired by the Leader of the Council (Lord True), Cabinet Member for Environment and Business, Cllr Pamela Fleming and the Cabinet Member for Communities, Cllr Susan Chappell will review them all and produce a shortlist of winners.

-   All those shortlisted will be invited to a celebration event on Saturday 29 November 2014 at York House.
-   Winners will receive a commemorative lapel pin and certificate.
-   Nominations are open between Monday 8 September 2014 and Friday 17 October 2014.
