Over the next three years, London's Screen Archives is hitting the road for London: A Bigger Picture - a major project to introduce the capital to its cinematic heritage, and collect your home movies. First stop? Hounslow.

Come to your local theatre to see treats from Hounslow Local Studies and Archive introduced by London's Screen Archives archivist Louise Pankhurst. She is joined by Local Studies Librarian James Marshall who will explain how the films fit into Hounslow's history and reveal more about the rich shared past they represent.

Local highlights include a Fire Brigade display from 1938, Coronation Celebrations in Hounslow in 1953 and a very early film of an Annual Sports Day from 1912.

The programme doesn't just feature highlights from Hounslow archives, there are also gems from other film archives across the city - reflecting the varied cultural heritage of London's outer boroughs.

#### Bring your films

A Bigger Picture is not just about celebrating the film archives held across the capital, it is about ensuring they stay packed full of rich material. And for that we need you!

Do you have films showing life in Hounslow borough? Whether its birthday parties, days out or just sitting around watching telly we want you to bring along any films that you would like to donate to your local archive. You won't just help to enrich the collection, you'll be preserving your memories for future audiences.
