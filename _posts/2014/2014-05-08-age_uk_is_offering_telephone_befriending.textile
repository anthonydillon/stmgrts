Not having someone to talk to regularly can be lonely and isolating. A friendly chat can make all the difference and that's where we can help.

We are working in partnership with local neighbourhood care groups to offer those in need free regular friendly phone calls.

If you are over 50, live in the Borough of Richmond upon Thames and think this service could benefit you or someone you know, please call us on 0845 601 1149[1]

If you would like to volunteer as a Telephone Befriender, please get in touch.

Find out about our services at "www.ageukrichmond.org.uk":http://www.ageukrichmond.org.uk

fn1. phone lines are open from 10.00am-4.00pm, Monday-Friday.
