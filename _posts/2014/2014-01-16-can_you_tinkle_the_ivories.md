excerpt: |
    A local 1950's style rock 'n' roll group are looking for a keyboard player to enhance their sound. Their repertoire ranges from Jerry Lee Lewis rockers to smoochy teen ballads and twangy instrumentals. Age and experience are totally immaterial. The only qualification needed is Enthusiasm! For fun and some fee-paying gigs too!
    
    Please contact Billy Sincere on 0208 892 5211.
