This is co-run by Surya Cooper and the amazing Elaine Samuels of Kindred Spirit, in support of Off the Record -a local counselling service for children and young people. We'll be showing you how to tap into your inner creativity, get your thoughts on paper and craft those thoughts into beautiful works of art - whether you've already written songs or are a complete beginner this will be a fun workshop with plenty of practical exercises and a good opportunity to meet other like-minded people.

The early bird price is &pound;35 and this has been extended to 20<sup>th</sup> December (full price &pound;50 if booked after 20<sup>th</sup>)

For anyone who'd like to develop their singing and percussion skills we'd love to see you on Thursday mornings from 10am to 12noon at a private house in St Margarets. All abilities welcome, you don't have to be able to read music or be an experienced singer! We not only sing part songs but work on developing range and tone, learn to improvise and harmonise by ear, plus exploring, pushing the boundaries, playing with and learning how to care for our voice as well as some fabulous breathing techniques.
