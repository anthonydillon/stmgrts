Visitors to Orleans House Gallery in Twickenham will recognise this familiar feathered friend.

A mallard duck, named the 'Duck d'Orleans' after the former resident of Orleans House, has returned for the second year running.

He sits 30 feet up on the archway to the Stables Courtyard and quacks.

He is gaining quite a following.
