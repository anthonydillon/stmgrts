<div markdown="1" class="letter">
Dear Sir/Madam,

Thank you for providing feedback on our proposal to remove the pedestrian footbridge over the A316 at St Margaret's roundabout.

Following requests for further information regarding the proposal we are contacting you to let you know that we have updated the consultation website with additional information and have extended the consultation period for two weeks, so the consultation will now close on the 18 July 2014 instead of 4 July 2014.

Consultees will have the opportunity to resubmit their response if they feel that their view has changed.
