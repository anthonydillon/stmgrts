_Space to Be_ will be hosting a mindfulness taster session from 7:30-9:00pm on Monday, 8 December 2014 at the Emmanuel Centre, the new hall at the back of St James Catholic Church in Twickenham.  The cost of the taster is &pound;5 and booking is essential.

Mindfulness is a practice which involves deliberately bringing your awareness to the present moment with acceptance and non-judgement.  Research suggests that meditation and awareness training can boost the immune system, significantly reduce stress, improve sleep, bolster creativity, reduce the ruminative thinking that leads to anxiety and depression and improve relationships with loved ones and friends.



Could mindfulness be your path to less stress and greater wellbeing?  Come along to the taster session and find out!
