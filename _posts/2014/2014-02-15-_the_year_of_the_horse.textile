    Welcome to the Year of the Horse. Last year it was the Year of the Snake and next year it will be the Year of the Sheep....but this year it is the Year of the Horse - and so the horoscope of the East rolls around its mysterious annual cycle.
    
    Unlike the Western astrological system which divides the year into 12 monthly sections, each one named after a star constellation, the Eastern system is based on a cycle of 12 years, each with its own animal symbol.

_Jan 31, 2014 - Feb 18, 2015_

Welcome to the Year of the Horse. Last year it was the Year of the Snake and next year it will be the Year of the Sheep....but this year it is the Year of the Horse - and so the horoscope of the East rolls around its mysterious annual cycle.

Unlike the Western astrological system which divides the year into 12 monthly sections, each one named after a star constellation, the Eastern system is based on a cycle of 12 years, each with its own animal symbol.


<a href="//stmargarets.london/assets/images/2014/HORO_Chinese-New-Year.jpg" title="See larger version of - Chinese New Year"><img src="//stmargarets.london/assets/images/2014/HORO_Chinese-New-Year_thumb.jpg" width="150" height="100" alt="Chinese New Year" class="photo right" /></a>

According to an ancient story, on a New Years Day, sometime in the distant past, Buddha called together all the animals of the world. He promised that all who came to pay him honour would have a year named after them. Only 12 animals turned up ...the rat and the ox, the tiger and the rabbit, the dragon, the snake and the horse, the sheep and the monkey, the cock, the dog and the boar. True to his promise Buddha granted each animal its own year and they in turn contributed some of their own characteristics to that year, making each year distinctive.

According to eastern belief people inherit the characteristic traits of the animal representing the year in which they were born. For example people born in the Year of the Monkey, i.e 1944, 1956. 1968, 1980 or 1992 are eccentric geniuses, skilled at handling money, creative and good at solving problems. People born in the Year of the Tiger, i.e 1950, 1962, 1974, 1986 or 1998 are sensitive, short-tempered, given to deep thought and sympathetic to those they love. However they often come into conflict with older people or those in authority. Children born in the Year of the Horse, this year, are cheerful, popular and good with money. They also talk too much!

The character attributes in eastern astrology are quite detailed, particularly when it comes to relationships. It can offer good advice on what 'year type' to associate with or marry and who to avoid. A person born in a Snake year, i.e 1953, 1965, 1977 or 1989 would be wise to marry an Ox person, that's 1949, 1961, 1973, 1985 or 1997 or a Cock person, 1957, 1969, 1981 or 1993 but avoid a Tiger person, 1950, 1962, 1974 or 1986  or a Boar person, 1947, 1959, 1971 or 1983 like the plaque!

A Japanese interpretation of the eastern horoscope suggests that a Monkey person like myself  would make a happy liaison with a Horse person - and after 30+ years together we have proved it to be right.

The Horoscope is full of interesting and unexpected  information. For example:-

<a href="//stmargarets.london/assets/images/2014/HORO_japanese-new-year-2013-ice-bath.jpg" title="See larger version of - Japanese new year 2013 ice bath"><img src="//stmargarets.london/assets/images/2014/HORO_japanese-new-year-2013-ice-bath_thumb.jpg" width="150" height="99" alt="Japanese new year 2013 ice bath" class="photo right" /></a>

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
<li>A Tiger person stands as an emblem of protection against "three disasters" - fire, thieves and ghosts.</li>
<li>A Dragon person can bring the 'five blessings' of riches, harmony, virtue, longevity and long life.</li>
<li>Dog people are not noted for small talk. (Perhaps they should hang out with a Horse person!)</li>
<li>In the Japanese tradition a Sheep person (a.k.a Goat person) will never have problems with 'i-shoku-ju' -i.e having good taste in clothes, a full table and a comfortable life.</li>
<li>Horse people are a push-over when it comes to members of the opposite sex.</li>
<li>Rabbit people are lucky with money and enjoy gossip.</li>
</ol>

So what does the Year of the Horse hold for us?

For those actually born in the Year of the Horse their fortunes will go up and down and efforts should be made to keep the peace between business colleagues and associates. Because it is a 'yang wood' year Feng Shui expert, Paul Ng, says that timber and agricultural companies will do well but precious metals and metal mining companies will do badly. Chinese astrologer Lok Tin warns that 'because the fire energies are strong' there may be a lot of volcanic activity in South America and gunfire. Fook Chik of the Feng Shui Society advises Horse people to prepare for some tense situations and emotional pressure. However he suggests that the year may be a good time for some self reflection.

As for the rest of us it is apparently a very good time to travel, ideally to somewhere we have never been before. We are advised to meet strangers, mingle with the locals, try authentic foods and enjoy local customs. There will be a general rise in optimism and people will come together within their communities to work on common projects....which is nice. So...

<pre class="poem">
Let our New Year's resolution be this;
We will be there for one another as fellow members of humanity
In the finest sense of the word.
</pre>
