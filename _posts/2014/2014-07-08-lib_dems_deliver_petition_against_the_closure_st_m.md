On Tuesday 8 July 2014, St Margarets and North Twickenham Councillors, Alexander Ehmann and Ben Khosa will submit a 600+ signatory petition to Liberal Democrat, London Assembly Member, Caroline Pidgeon. The petition, which calls for the withdrawal of Transport for London's (TfL's) plans to decommission an existing footbridge over the A316 in St Margarets, Twickenham, will be passed on to Mayor Boris Johnson by Caroline Pidgeon.

Local Liberal Democrat Councillors, Alexander Ehmann, Ben Khosa and Geoff Acton (Councillors for St Margarets and North Twickenham Ward) have put their weight behind local residents and concerned parents, who have expressed dismay over TfL's recent proposal to dismantle the current footbridge crossing of the A316 at St Margarets roundabout and replace it with Toucan crossings.

The current bridge is extensively used by parents and children commuting too and from schools in the locality and the proposed changes have sparked outrage from many, who believe that the changes create unnecessary risks for young people crossing the busy dual-carriageway.

Separately, Councillors Ehmann, Khosa and Acton have written to London Mayor, Boris Johnson and Richmond Council Leader, Lord True, asking for the current consultation to be withdrawn and for a proper investigation of alternatives to be undertaken.

Commenting on the petition and its submission to Caroline Pidgeon AM, Cllr Ehmann said:

> "The people of St Margarets and North Twickenham have spoken. Over 600 local citizens have asked TfL to withdraw their inept consultation and reconsider plans to remove our community footbridge.
> 
> 
>  "TfL must not continue to act with the arrogance and disdain to local concerns that they have to date. The strength of opinion is plain to see and TfL need to accept they got this one wrong."
