<em>Song from "Frozen" heats up Holly Lodge Centre Christmas Concert at St Mary Magdalene, Richmond</em>

The Choir of Clarenden special needs school in Hampton brought its inimitable version of <em>"Do you want to build a snowman?"</em> from the Disney movie, <em>"Frozen"</em> to St Mary Magdalene Church in Richmond as one of the highlights of the Holly Lodge Centre's annual Christmas concert Tuesday evening, 2 December.

The concert also included the choir of the Sheen Mount School whose 7-11 year-olds sang three non-traditional Christmas carols with great enthusiasm - and to great appreciation of the audience of Holly Lodge Centre supporters.

Capping the musical evening, the Sheen Gate Choir led the audience in <em>"The Holly and the Ivy"</em> and <em>"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing"</em>.  The Choir is made up of amateurs who rehearse weekly under the direction of Sam Gosden, director of music at the Newland House School.

The evening included readings by Claire Tomalin from poems by Alfred Lord Tennyson and Siegfried Sassoon and by Tim McMullan from winter scenes of <em>"Wind in the Willows."</em>

Dr. Pat Ealey, Community Engagement Manager of the Holly Lodge Centre, and Stewart Perkes, a Centre trustee, spoke of developments and priorities of the Holly Lodge Centre going into 2015 and beyond.

The Clarendon School in Hampton is a day community special school for pupils aged 7-16 with moderate learning difficulties and additional complex needs including autism.  The school choir is comprised of students and staff who enjoy singing and who use MAKATON signing which helps all students feel part of the choir.

The Sheen Mount School is a primary school based in East Sheen where music and the arts have a high profile.  Children at the school enjoy singing in school assemblies, concerts and shows.

The Holly Lodge Centre was founded more than 20 years ago with the aim of providing groups of children and adults - particularly those with special physical and educational needs - a secure environment in which to benefit from the natural and historic wonders of Richmond Park.  The Centre is a charity with over 100 volunteers which benefits from a number of events including this, the Centre's eighth annual Christmas concert.
