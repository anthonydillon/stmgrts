The original date (and therefore people who could make it) has changed and now I could do with a few more people to help. We had great fun when we did this at Christmas. Come and support us, or sing/play with us, make some new friends and have fun, whilst fundraising at the same time!

We'll be doing a variety of songs from the 1920s right up to modern ones.

If you contact me I can send you the songlist, bring songsheets with chords to share etc... "info@vitalvoices.co.uk":mailto:info@vitalvoices.co.uk  or 07770 993289
