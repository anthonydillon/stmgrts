After so many years of decline, London is experiencing a resurgence of brewing, with as many as 50 commercial breweries currently operating in London. An incredible increase since 2006 when Young ºs Brewery left London and there were only eight breweries remaining.

We have long supported many of these breweries and enjoyed watching them grow and develop their beers. We thought it was time we invited just a handful of the newest breweries to come and join us and give you the opportunity to meet their brewers, try some of their beers and share in one of London's current success stories.

**Breweries confirmed - Anspach & Hobday (est 2014), Brew by Numbers (est 2012), Rocky Head (est 2012) and Weird Beard (est 2013).**
