_Easter one week only starting March 31st_

Make a 5 minute film in 5 Days and take a copy home on DVD!

Here at Dreamcatcher Media, the films made on our Summer Film Camps feature great heroes and anti-heroes, goodies and baddies, exciting chases and dramatic scenes - all scripted, filmed and directed by young people aged 8 - 18.



Our summer 5 day Film Camp starts on 14<sup>th</sup> July. Children come up with their own idea for a film, and then set about shooting, directing and editing it over the five days under expert tuition from industry professionals. It's all great fun but good learning too and young wannabee filmmakers finish the course equipped to make their own movies.

Sponsored by the Alpha Plus Group, the Camp takes place at Falcons Boys Prep School in Richmond and runs for 5 weeks from July 14<sup>th</sup> until August 22<sup>nd</sup> starting at 9am. The dates are as follows -

* July 14<sup>th</sup> To July 18<sup>th</sup>
* July 21<sup>st</sup> To July 25<sup>th</sup>
* July 28<sup>th</sup> to August 1<sup>st</sup>
* August 11<sup>th</sup> To August 15<sup>th</sup>
* August 18<sup>th</sup> To August 22<sup>nd</sup>
