The Holly Lodge Centre in Richmond Park was founded more than 20 years ago with the aim of providing groups of children and adults - particularly those with special physical and educational needs - a secure environment in which to benefit from the natural and historic wonders of Richmond Park. The Centre is a charity with over 100 volunteers which relies entirely on donations from individuals and trusts. It also benefits from a number of events each year including this Christmas concert.
