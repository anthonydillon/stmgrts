A hotel with a difference will open in Richmond in the next few weeks when a habitat for a variety of insects is unveiled.

The borough's first ever Insect Hotel will open its doors on Sunshine Terrace, Twickenham Embankment. Five insect towers with compartments have been constructed from mild steel and will be installed onto the building. Richmond Council's Parks Team will work with local schools to fill the hotel with a variety of materials over the coming weeks that will act as a habitat for small insects. The type of creatures that may use the hotel include lacewings, ladybirds, beetles, butterflies, spiders, wasps and bumblebees.

Richmond Council Cabinet Member for Environment, Cllr Pamela Fleming, said:

bq. "The Insect Hotel is part of the Council's exciting Riverside Project and will increase the biodiversity interest and activity in the area. I'm sure it will be an eye-grabbing feature for residents and visitors to admire."
