    We will be cycling from Whole Foods in Richmond to Shooting Star Chase Hospice in Hampton and delivering Christmas gifts to the children. We had a great turn out last year and are hoping to make it even bigger this year. It's 100% FREE to enter and all you need to do is be dressed in a Santa suit and buy a recommended Christmas gift for the kids at the Hospice and/or donate direct to the hospice via our justgiving page: "www.justgiving.com/NjingaSantaCharityCycle":http://www.justgiving.com/NjingaSantaCharityCycle/

On 6 December 2014, we will be cycling from Whole Foods in Richmond to Shooting Star Chase Hospice in Hampton and delivering Christmas gifts to the children. We had a great turn out last year and are hoping to make it even bigger this year. It's 100% FREE to enter and all you need to do is be dressed in a Santa suit and buy a recommended Christmas gift for the kids at the Hospice and/or donate direct to the hospice via our justgiving page: "www.justgiving.com/NjingaSantaCharityCycle":http://www.justgiving.com/NjingaSantaCharityCycle/

When we get back from the ride, we have organised for food and drinks to be provided by Wholefoods Richmond.


We'd really like to try and raise &pound;1,000 for Shooting Stars Chase Hospice in Hampton as well as arriving with a mountain of presents for the kids! We have a target of 100 riders this year! Hope you can help us and to clarify, we are not taking a penny for ourselves and are organising this event at our expense.
