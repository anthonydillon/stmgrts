Crown Road will be closed for the day so our Christmas market can fill the street and make your Christmas gift shopping a breeze!

There'll be the usual diverse mix of stalls, food vendors, children's entertainment, fairground rides and attractions, real-life reindeer (!) with a very special jolly visitor from the North Pole who'll be ready to hear your Christmas wish lists! There'll be a few special surprises too so make sure you come along and join in the fun!
