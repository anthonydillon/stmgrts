bq.. "In being given this honour I am totally thrilled that the years of commitment to fundraising in David's memory and striving to better the future outcomes for other leukaemia and cancer sufferers have been recognised. I will continue, with the help and support of a fantastic voluntary committee, to do my very best to fundraise and support the Royal Marsden Hospital in any way I can. I feel very thrilled, honoured and humbled to receive this prestigious award.

I am enormously indebted to my late parents Irene and Bertie Joel who showed me the importance of and significance of fundraising; to my very hard working voluntary committee of friends who have been so loyal throughout the years; the fund's Administrator Liz Harrison who works tirelessly for the charity; our 2,000 strong database of supporters who have so helped to realise these achievements and to my second husband Lloyd McGuire who has followed and supported my passion The David Adams Leukaemia Appeal Fund. Last but not least to my beloved children Alex and Katie Adams who are the embodiment of their late father. Through his amazing example and courage in facing the disease, I seek to try to help others who find themselves in the same devastating situation and I wish to keep his cherished memory alive."
