*Surviving the summer holidays? Need to re-energise, rejuvenate and relax?*

There are many ways in which yoga can improve your health. Providing relief from the hustle and bustle of the summer holidays is one of them!

From September, once the kids are back at school and you have a chance for some 'me time', Yoga-Fitness is starting the following courses:

#### 'Complete Beginners' Yoga Course, starting 14 September 2014

*Voted 'Netmums Favourite Adult Class in Richmond 2014'*

This 5 week course has been designed for the complete beginner. It will introduce you into the world of yoga via the key yoga poses, (asana), and sequences, basic breathing, (pranayama) and relaxation techniques. All of which you would expect to come across in any general yoga class. .

-   Sunday evenings, 8:05pm - 9:15pm at the ETNA Centre, East Twickenham

#### 'Improving Beginners' Yoga Course, starting 4 September 2014

This 5 week course has been specifically designed for the beginner who has some previous experience, knows some of the basics and wants to deepen their knowledge and practice further.

Focus will be upon some of the stronger standing postures, as well as the deeper backbends, twists and inversions. More advanced breathing and relaxation techniques will be introduced

-   Thursday evenings, 8:05pm - 9:15pm at 'The Training Works' St Margarets

Both of the above courses will help to improve body tone, strength, flexibility and posture, as well as provide that valuable time to rejuvenate and relax.
