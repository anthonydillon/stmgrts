_'Complete Beginners Yoga Course' voted favourite adult class in Richmond area._

A St Margarets 'Complete Beginners Yoga Course' has scooped one of the top awards in the 'Classes For You' competition, run by Britain's biggest parenting site Netmums.

The UK-wide competition was launched as a chance for people running adult classes to be recognised for their hard work serving and improving the local community. Over 1.7 million members were eligible to vote in the competition



The 'Complete Beginners Course' held at the ETNA Community Centre on Sunday evenings, runs throughout the year and is designed for the complete beginner with no previous experience, (or for those who are very rusty and want to re-visit the basics). The course introduces the student into the world of yoga via the key yoga poses and sequences, breathing and relaxation techniques. The physical postures help improve tone, strength, flexibility, posture and balance, whilst the breathing and relaxation techniques give a much needed opportunity to rejuvenate and relax.

Sammie Mason, director of Yoga-Fitness was delighted to be crowned a local favourite and commented;

bq. "Going to a general yoga class for the first time can be a little daunting if you have never done it before. I wanted to provide a platform for people to learn the basics in a safe and friendly environment, with people who are at exactly the same level. I try and take the time during each class to teach all of the intricacies of each pose, helping students to develop their confidence."

The next 4 week 'Complete Beginners Course' is due to start at the end of April on the following dates:

* April 27<sup>th</sup>, May 4<sup>th</sup>, 11<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup> 2014
