Recent newcomer to St Margarets, Alexander Technique teacher Bronwyn Baud is now resident and available all week in St Margarets.

Bronwyn trained at the Brighton Alexander Training Centre and since qualifying in 1997, has had practices in Surrey and in Australia.  After recently returning to the UK , she chose to live and work in St Margarets.

The Alexander Technique helps millions of people across the world to naturally overcome muscle tension and stiffness, back, neck and joint pain, poor posture, breathing and vocal problems, as well as anxiety and stress-related conditions.

The Technique works by helping you to identify and prevent the harmful postural habits that may be the cause of stress and pain. Learning to use yourself better with poised natural body alignment will help improve overall functioning and well-being.

Through gentle hands-on guidance, you can find ease and balance within yourself  in simple movements and everyday activities. By gaining increased awareness, it enables you to change long-standing habits,  thereby learning how to function more efficiently.

You can improve how you move, perform, look and feel!
