    The campaign has been working hard to increase awareness of the TFL proposal. This has been done by using social media, school networks and more visual displays such as the banner placed on the St Stephen's school fence adjacent to the footbridge and a short one minute video.

The campaign has been working hard to increase awareness of the TFL proposal. This has been done by using social media, school networks and more visual displays such as the banner placed on the St Stephen's school fence adjacent to the footbridge and a short one minute video.

Councillors in Richmond have been contacted by many people in the borough to express their concerns and requests for help to resolve the issue. They have shown support and have been proactive in assisting the campaign by contacting TFL and the Mayor of London to demand answers.



The TFL decision making team has also been contacted directly by many supporters of the campaign to voice their opinions towards the proposal to remove the footbridge and replace it with a ground level crossing.

Please help the campaign and sign the online petition.
