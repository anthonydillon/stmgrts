    Local Liberal Democrat Councillors, Alexander Ehmann, Ben Khosa and Geoff Acton (Councillors for St Margarets and North Twickenham Ward) have put their weight behind local residents and  concerned parents, who have expressed dismay over TfL's recent proposal to dismantle the  current footbridge crossing of the A316 at St Margarets roundabout and replace it with Toucan  crossings.

On Wednesday 25 June at 3:30pm, local councillors will be joined by parents and residents at a street  assembly against Transport for London's (TfL's) plans to decommission an existing footbridge over  the A316 in St Margarets, Twickenham.

Local Liberal Democrat Councillors, Alexander Ehmann, Ben Khosa and Geoff Acton (Councillors for St Margarets and North Twickenham Ward) have put their weight behind local residents and  concerned parents, who have expressed dismay over TfL's recent proposal to dismantle the  current footbridge crossing of the A316 at St Margarets roundabout and replace it with Toucan  crossings.

The current bridge is extensively used by parents and children commuting too and from schools in  the locality and the proposed changes have sparked outrage from many, who believe that the  changes create unnecessary risks for young people crossing the busy dual-carriageway.

Councillors Ehmann, Khosa and Acton have written to London Mayor, Boris Johnson and  Richmond Council Leader, Lord True, asking for the current consultation to be withdrawn and for a  proper investigation of alternatives to be undertaken.

Commenting on the proposals, Cllr Ehmann said...

bq. "The consultation is a sham. It offers no explanation of the rationale for the bridge's destruction. It  offers no options beyond the replacement of the bridge with a surface crossing and it doesn't offer  even the simplest information on the usage and capacity impacts of the proposal regarding  pedestrian safety and the free-flow of traffic on the A316  He added  "The primary focus of any change to the road crossing arrangements on the A316 should be  pedestrian safety and thereafter the free passage of road traffic. We have written to Lord True and  Mayor Boris Johnson to ask them to intervene in this botched plan and to ask them withdraw the  current consultation, until TfL are in a position to provide a more reasonable set of options to local  residents and parents."
