> Hi I wondered if I was the only one in St Margarets being kept awake in the dead of the night by trains parking up with their engines running for a couple of hours whilst engineering work goes on ? I enquired at the station but it was a waste of time. I rang South West trains they knew even less. Anyone got any suggestions?
