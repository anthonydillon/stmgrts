    Neal's Yard Galleries have set up another nomadic gallery right on Chiswick roundabout. It's open on Friday 1-4pm and Saturday 1-4pm of this week, before it reopens somewhere else.
    
    A lot of the work is going on to the Affordable Art Fair if it doesn't sell (although there were quite a few red stickers last week..). The paintings, sculpture and ceramics are by exceptional artists and very competitively priced. A wide range of artwork in a good sized space!
