Richmond Bridge Primary School is a proposed free school which plans to open in the St Margarets area of Richmond in September 2015. Initially opening with two Reception classes, the school will grow organically to its full capacity of 420 pupils.

Your support can make it happen!

We intend to apply to the Department for Education in January 2014 and in order for our submission to be successful we need to show that, among many other things, we have the support of parents and the community. If you are considering sending your child(ren) to Richmond Bridge Primary, please show your support through Register page of the school's website at "www.richmondbridgeprimary.co.uk":http://www.richmondbridgeprimary.co.uk.

We're going to be out and about in Richmond over the next few weeks talking to people about our proposed school. If you see us, please stop for a chat, take a leaflet and tell all your friends!
