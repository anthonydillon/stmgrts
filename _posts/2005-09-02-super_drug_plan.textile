On 23 August 2005, planning permission was granted by the Richmond Council to Superdrug to start renovations in the former Phelps store.  The only aspect not approved was the request to use a backlit sign.  The council noted:

bq. the proposed signage shown on the drawings needs to be the subject of an application of Advertisement Consent.  The applicant is further advised that internally illuminated signage is likely to be resisted by this Council, and that externally illuminated signage using traditional materials such as painted timber is recommended.

In fact renovations have started already and the store should be open in just a few weeks time.  The larger local concern for the traffic & parking issues, delivery times and rubbish removal issues which are likely to be made worse with both a Tesco and Superdrug sharing a single loading bay.
