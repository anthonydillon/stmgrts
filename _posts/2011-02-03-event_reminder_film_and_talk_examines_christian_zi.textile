    A film which examines the fascinating but rarely acknowledged role that Christian Zionism plays in the story of Israel and Palestine will be shown in Richmond next week.
    
    "With God On Our Side" includes contributions from internationally renowned author and Middle East expert, the Reverend Dr Stephen Sizer, vicar of Christ Church, Virginia Water, and he will be present at the film showing to give a talk and answer questions.
    
    The film looks at the theology of Christian Zionism which teaches that Jews are "God's chosen people"and therefore have a "divine right" to the land of Israel. Aspects of this belief lead the Christian Zionists to support Israeli government policies which privilege Jews at the expense of Palestinians, leading to suffering among Christian and Muslim Palestinians and threatening Israel's long term security.

A film which examines the fascinating but rarely acknowledged role that Christian Zionism plays in the story of Israel and Palestine will be shown in Richmond next week.

"With God On Our Side" includes contributions from internationally renowned author and Middle East expert, the Reverend Dr Stephen Sizer, vicar of Christ Church, Virginia Water, and he will be present at the film showing to give a talk and answer questions.

The film looks at the theology of Christian Zionism which teaches that Jews are "God's chosen people"and therefore have a "divine right" to the land of Israel. Aspects of this belief lead the Christian Zionists to support Israeli government policies which privilege Jews at the expense of Palestinians, leading to suffering among Christian and Muslim Palestinians and threatening Israel's long term security.

Dr Sizer has spent many years studying the theology, politics and history of the Middle East and is the author of "Christian Zionism - Road Map to Armageddon?" He believes Christian Zionism shapes United States foreign policy towards Israel/Palestine.

"With God On Our Side," directed by Porter Speakman, will be shown at the Richmond and Putney Unitarian Church Hall, Ormond Road, Richmond, TW10 6TH on Wednesday, February 9<sup>th</sup>, at 7.30 pm. Entry is free.
