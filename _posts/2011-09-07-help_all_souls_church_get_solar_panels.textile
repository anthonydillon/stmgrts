    Please help support All Souls Church's bid to get funding through the 'Energy share' fund to get Solar panels installed on the church roof.  If they are successful in winning the grant they will be reinvesting the money made from the 'feed-in-tariff' to support community projects with local schools and young people in the long term.
    
    They have managed to get into the final 100 successful bids across the whole of the UK but  only have until the end of September to seek as many local supporters as possible to ensure they are successful in gaining the fund and installing the panels.
    
    Please support them now, it is only and only take a minute: "www.energyshare.com/all-souls-solar":http://www.energyshare.com/all-souls-solar/
