    The actor David Walliams is swimming the 140 mile length of the Thames for Sports Relief.  He has caught the 'Thames tummy' and progress has slowed a bit, but he is expected to make it to the Twickenham/Richmond area Sunday or Monday.
    
    He has raised nearly &pound;500k so far for Sports Relief and could use your support both on the riverside and financially.  Why not come down to the Thames and cheer David on?
