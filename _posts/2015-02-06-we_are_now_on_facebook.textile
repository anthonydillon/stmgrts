After years of resisting, we finally decided to join the "facebook":https://www.facebook.com/stmgrts to make it easier for many readers to find our news.

We are posting all of our articles and upcoming events there.  So if you are on facebook, "please 'like us'":https://www.facebook.com/stmgrts.

And, don't forget we are also on twitter at "@smgrts":https://twitter.com/stmgrts
