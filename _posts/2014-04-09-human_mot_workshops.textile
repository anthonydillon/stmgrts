Spend a morning being guided through a series of questions and exercises, carefully designed to help identify what makes you tick, and clarify how to effectively most enjoy your precious time. Using a blend of life coaching, visualisation, and NLP, Sara and Rebecca run small, friendly group sessions each month, from Rosslyn Rd.

The next workshop is on Friday, 25 April 2014, from 9.30 to 1.00, Rosslyn Rd.
