    In London, only 1 in 10 of us count our neighbours as friends and so we want to film with a number of households on one street over six weeks in the summer to find out more about the people that live there. We'd then like to offer those people the opportunity to gain an insight into each other's lives and see whether this makes a difference to their relationships with each other.

In London, only 1 in 10 of us count our neighbours as friends and so we want to film with a number of households on one street over six weeks in the summer to find out more about the people that live there. We'd then like to offer those people the opportunity to gain an insight into each other's lives and see whether this makes a difference to their relationships with each other.

As a result, the series will look at life at home today on a mixed street; we will get to know the people who are filming with us and see from different perspectives all the things that unite us: family relationships, work stresses and joys, conversations over the dinner table, what makes us happy and what makes us sad.
