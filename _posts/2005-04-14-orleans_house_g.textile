The "Orleans House Gallery":http://www.richmond.gov.uk/depts/opps/eal/leisure/arts/orleanshouse/default.htm has received nearly Â£1 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund to create a new education facility in the currently unused coach house and stables.  Construction work has already begun and should be completed by December this year.

The new facility will have the latest in audio visual equipment and be ready for teaching as well as small dance and theatre performances.  These renovations will be a welcome addition to the visiting exhibitions that already are showcased in the main building and be a valuable addition to the community.
