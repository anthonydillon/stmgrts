    Would you like all Richmond children to eat freshly prepared sustainable food at school?  
    
    With a new school meals contract due to start in September 2011, Richmond Council has an ideal opportunity, and the lead-time required, to make the borough's school meal service a model of excellence for local authorities across the country.
