On 20 April 2007, Richmond Council has "refused planning permission":http://www.ukplanning.com/richmond/showCaseFile.do?councilName=London+Borough+of+Richmond+upon+Thames&appNumber=07/0599/FUL for _Your Parmacy's_ "application":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2007/03/your_pharmacy_a.html for an external ATM.

Reason for the refusal was that the plans would "visually clutter" the shop frontage, the street scene and the entire St Margarets' conservation area.
