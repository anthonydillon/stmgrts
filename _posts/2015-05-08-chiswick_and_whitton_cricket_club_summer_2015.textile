Our summer training programme has just started and we are keen for local children to come along and have fun playing cricket.

We are based at Whitton Park (190 Wills Crescent, Hounslow TW3 2JD) and training takes place every Sunday from 9.30am - 11.30am. This will continue until the end of the school term in July 2015.

Please see the attached poster for full details. School children aged 14 upwards train on Monday evenings.

Also, we have been provided with a charitable donation to cover the annual subscription for children that are entitled to free school meals and who would otherwise not consider playing cricket due to financial hardship.

We are keen to get ALL children involved in playing cricket irrespective of background and ability.

We now have 10 qualified and DBS (previously CRB) cleared coaches provided coaching to boys and girls of all school age groups.

We have u10s, u11s, u13s, u15s and u17 teams in the Middlesex Colts Association competitions and arrange friendly games for children aged under 9.
