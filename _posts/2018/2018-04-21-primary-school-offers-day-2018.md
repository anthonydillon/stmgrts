Ninety eight percent of in-borough applicants have been offered a place at one of their first three preferred primary schools.

On 16 April, Richmond Council made the initial allocation of Reception class offers for this September. This year, 2,174 pupils applied for a place - compared with 2,363 last year.

88% will be offered a place at their first preference primary school, compared to last year's figure of 84% and 2016's figure of 83%.

Currently there are no children without an offer of a primary school place, compared to last year when 34 children were without an initial offer (all were made offers within weeks).
