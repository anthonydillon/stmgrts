A new community kitchen and caf&#233; in Twickenham is a step closer with help from Richmond Council.

East Twickenham Neighbourhood Association (ETNA) has been awarded &pound;12,000 through the Council's Community Fund to help with the project.

ETNA's Community Kitchen Project will allow the Community Centre to run a community caf&#233; in partnership with The Real Junk Food Project (TRJP), whose aim is to fill bellies not bins.  Using surplus food collected from local supermarkets, bakeries and other retailers, TRJFP will help the ETNA centre to tackle social isolation through the sharing of food while simultaneously reducing landfill.

The project will also improve step-free access to the centre and provide new space for residents to meet and take part in cooking related activities, such as 'Man & A Pan' run by AGE UK.

Cllr Michael Wilson, Cabinet Member for Equality, Communities and the Voluntary Sector said:

> "This project will add a lot of value to the great work ETNA centre does in the local community. The improved facilities and cafe area will help to bring people together, build friendships and enable people to learn new skills. It will allow more people to get involved and it is great to support ETNA to bring this space to life for the wider community".


Vanessa James, Director of the East Twickenham Neighbourhood Association (ETNA) Community Centre said:

> "Sharing food is a great way of bringing people together and talking isolation.  This is at the heart of our ambition to build a Community Kitchen at the ETNA Centre.  We are delighted that so many of our users showed their support by voting for our project and this grant will provide a welcome boost to our fundraising campaign to make this a reality.


ETNA is one of eight organisations to be awarded funding in the latest round of the Community Fund.
