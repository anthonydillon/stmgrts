People are now able to have their say on a proposal to introduce a Public Space Protection Order (PSPO) around the British Pregnancy Advisory Service Clinic in Rosslyn Road, Twickenham.

The consultation on the proposed PSPO, which would address concerns raised around protests and vigils taking place outside the Clinic, opened today and will run until Monday 10<sup>th</sup> December.

A PSPO under section 59 of the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 allows the Council to prohibit specific activities, and/or require certain things to be done by people engaged in particular activities, to stop a detrimental impact on people in a defined public area

Cllr Liz Jaeger, Cabinet Member for Community Safety said:

> "People have, for several years, expressed concerns in relation to protests being held outside the BPAS Clinic in Rosslyn Road which we have been told have caused distress and intimidation.


> "We are now asking residents to have their say on the proposals to implement a Public Space Protection Order in the area surrounding the Rosslyn Road.


> "It's important to remember the proposed PSPO would not ban anyone from protesting or hosting a vigil, but would prevent such protests or vigils taking place near the clinic."


The consultation runs until Monday 10<sup>th</sup> December 2018. Visit [haveyoursay.citizenspace.com/community-safety/rosslyn-road/consult_view/](https://haveyoursay.citizenspace.com/community-safety/rosslyn-road/consult_view/ ) to have your say before the deadline
