A Twickenham school under the leadership of a local Trust has been praised by the Department for Education for their work to make improvements.

The Richmond West Schools Multi-Academy Trust (RWST) was set up 18 months ago to help support two local secondary schools that require improvement &mdash; Twickenham Academy and Hampton High.

This Trust means that the schools work together to share best practice, economies of scale, joint systems and approaches.

According to a recent report from Ofsted, Twickenham Academy has made huge strides over the past 12 months.

The report praised the very passionate leadership of Headteacher, Assal Ruse, and her enthusiastic and committed team at Twickenham Academy. Specifically highlighting that "the school is led with skill and passion. The headteacher inspires staff at all levels to do the very best for pupils." In addition, positive feedback included improvements to pupil attitude and behaviour and inadequate teaching.

Inspectors said:

> "Many pupils make good progress because they are increasingly well-taught. Pupils are highly respectful of their teachers and confident that they are supported well."


And

> "Leaders have tackled inadequate teaching decisively and improvements are extremely well-led across the school".


Inspectors did highlight areas for improvement and the school are driving for an even better report in the next inspection.

Richmond Council's Member for Children's Services and Schools, Cllr Penny Frost, said:

> "Over the past few years Twickenham Academy have worked hard, with the support of the Trust, to drive improvements. It was never going to be a quick fix. However, this report shows that things are definitely heading in the right direction.


> "There is much more to do, but this is good news for those school communities. I look forward to working with them to drive further improvement over the next few years."


Ms Ruse, Headteacher of Twickenham School, said:

> "I am so proud of our students!  I am pleased that Ofsted has recognised the significant improvements since our last inspection. We were left with an extremely challenging legacy. Leaders across the school have been instrumental in driving improvement which would not have been possible without our dedicated, committed and hardworking staff and Governors."


> "We have improved the school but we know that there is still work to be done and we look forwards to parents and staff supporting us to make Twickenham School even better."


Acting CEO for RWST, Phillipa Nunn, said:

> "I would like to congratulate Ms Ruse on her great leadership of Twickenham School.  The dramatic Improvements in all areas of that school are evident and have been recognised by Ofsted these judgements are especially impressive as it is only 18 months since the previous Trust left the school.  RWST looks forward to continuing to work with Mrs Ruse to further improve Twickenham School".
