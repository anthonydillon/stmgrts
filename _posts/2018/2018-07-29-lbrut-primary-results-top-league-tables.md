Pupils attending primary schools in Richmond upon Thames are expected to top the national league tables yet again following publication of the 2018 Key Stage 2 (SATs) results.

The results show that the borough has scored well above the national average in nearly all areas with 87% of pupils achieving the expected standard in reading, 87% in writing, 88% in mathematics, whilst 80% did so in reading, writing and mathematics combined.

The borough also had a large proportion of pupils achieving the higher standard, with 47 % of pupils in reading, 30 % in writing, 42 % in mathematics and 20 % in all three subjects combined doing so.

Cllr Penny Frost, Cabinet Member for Schools on Richmond Council, said:

> "These results show that yet again our primary schools are excelling - building on our high results last year. It demonstrates that despite difficult financial circumstances, our schools are showing both first class standards and a commitment to continue to do the best for every pupil.


> "My congratulations go to the pupils, teaching staff and governors for their achievements with improvements having been made in every area."
