To make recycling across Richmond upon Thames even easier, recycling points for unwanted electric and electronic items  are being made available at most libraries across the borough.

Earlier this year, Richmond Council trialled the scheme at Twickenham and Ham Libraries - both becoming drop off points for residents wishing to dispose of their broken or unwanted small electrical items responsibly.

The trial was so successful that it is now being extended to other libraries.

From 3<sup>rd</sup> December, everything from broken computer keyboards, toasters, radios, irons, hair straighteners and battery powered toys can be left in the new small WEEE (Waste Electronic and Electrical Equipment) bins at the below libraries:

* Castelnau
* East Sheen
* Hampton
* Hampton Hill
* Richmond Lending Library
* Teddington
* Whitton
* Twickenham
* Ham

It's estimated that one million tonnes of electrical items are thrown away in the UK each year. This type of waste is considered hazardous and is growing three times faster than any other type of waste.

Please note that if you are disposing of items which have personal data stored, it is your responsibility to delete this data before placing the item in the bin.

Cllr Martin Elengorn, Richmond Council Cabinet Member for Environment, said:

> "We want to make it as easy as possible for people to recycle. So, combining a visit to the library with an opportunity to recycle makes sense.


> "Many people store broken or unwanted electrical goods away in cupboards, garages or sheds. We want to ensure that the valuable resources they contain can be recycled."
