New members welcome! Our aim is to provide an inclusive musical experience that is friendly and fun. We also aim to challenge and inspire, leaving you refreshed and rejuvenated.

We will sing uplifting songs each week ranging from popular classics, contemporary, gospel and African chants and you'll learn basic singing techniques and improve your health and well-being.

Lots of lovey friendships have formed so it's a great way to meet new people. Upon arrival you will be welcomed by other members.
