Have a go at something new with June's 'Festival of Learning' programme

Love to learn? Have a go at something new at one of our libraries as part of the 'Festival of Learning' being held throughout June.

This year's full programme of events includes a chance to find out the history of your house, learn a new language with introductory Greek or Italian, or get to know your digital device. You can also find out how babies learn language or get a crash course in how to give your baby or child first aid.

Have a go at something new, you'll be amazed at what you can achieve! Be quick and book online as whilst events are free space is limited. Don't miss out!

Cllr John Coombs, Cabinet Member for Arts, Culture and Sport said:

> "The variety of programmes and support put on by our libraries team is truly incredible and this month's programme is a great example of that.

> "From new parents, to linguists, to historians, to everything in between there's something fun for you to learn at one of our libraries throughout June. Book now so you don't miss out!"
