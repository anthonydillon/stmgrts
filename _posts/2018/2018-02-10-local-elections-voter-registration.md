On Thursday 3 May residents in Richmond upon Thames will go to the polls to have their say on who represents them at a local level.

Local government elections select councillors, who are responsible for making decisions on running services in your local area. These include housing, education, transport, planning, parks, leisure, social care and waste management.

In order to vote in this important election, residents must be on the electoral register. The deadline to register to vote in local elections is fast approaching. Therefore, Richmond Council is urging residents who have not registered at their current address to make sure they are registered in time.

The deadline to register to vote is midnight on Tuesday 17 April. Anyone can apply online at [gov.uk/register-to-vote](http://gov.uk/register-to-vote). It takes just five minutes.

Mark Maidment, Electoral Registration Officer for Richmond Council, said:


> "Time is running out to make sure you can take part in the local elections. These elections are an opportunity to make your voice heard and have a say on who represents you on issues that directly affect day-to-day life here in Richmond upon Thames But if you're not registered by 17 April, you won't be able to vote."


Adrian Green, Electoral Commission Regional Manager for London, said:


> "If you have turned 18, or if you have moved home recently, it's particularly important that you act to ensure that you are registered. It takes just five minutes online and means that you can take part in this important election."


If you were eligible to vote in last year's general election and your details have not changed, you will still be registered to vote. If in doubt, check your details by giving us a call on 020 8891 7775.
