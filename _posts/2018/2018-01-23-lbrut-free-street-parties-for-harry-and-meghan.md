*Get ready to (street) party for Royal Wedding!*

Street parties for the Royal Wedding this spring are being encouraged by Richmond Council, which is again covering the costs of all road closures in streets where residents would like to organise celebrations.

The Council met the official costs for street parties during the previous royal wedding and Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations. Over 100 events were held.

Now, for the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, the Council has agreed to wave the cost of closing roads on the 19<sup>th</sup> 20<sup>th</sup> May and the bank holiday weekend of 26<sup>th</sup>,27<sup>th</sup> and 28<sup>th</sup> May.  This includes the cost of the statutory adverts required to make drivers aware. Neighbours and resident groups will only have to find the cost of hiring 'road closed' signage.

The deadline for applications is the 30<sup>th</sup> April 2018.

Cllr Peter Buckwell, Richmond Council Cabinet Member for Highways and Street Scene, said:

> "We saw a great outpouring of goodwill across our borough for Prince William's wedding, and I would love to see the same for his younger brother.

> "We have already had a number of requests for street parties, but we want to encourage even more people to come together, show some community spirt and celebrate this joyful day.

> "We will again do our bit for local people this year by covering the costs of closing roads, helping people mark this national occasion together."


Advice from Richmond Council is to prepare well in advance, including talking to neighbours, and applying in good time to have roads closed. The Council has a Street Party information webpage with application form. Go to: [www.richmond.gov.uk/street_parties](http://www.richmond.gov.uk/street_parties )for details.
