Cllr John Coombs, Cabinet Member for Arts, Culture and Sport said:

> "With the recent hot weather we've been having I'm sure children are keen to get into the water. If your child is looking to learn to swim or improve their skills in the water I encourage you to get in touch with Pools on the Park and Teddington Pools and find a swim course that's best for them!"


All classes must be booked and paid for in advance, and a medical form and application must be completed for each child.
