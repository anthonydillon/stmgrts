Members of the local community are joining together to launch the Old Isleworth Market on Saturday 28 April from 10am to 2pm.

Focusing on high quality food, the market will offer locals an alternative to the supermarket and a chance to purchase locally sourced, affordable produce.

Residents of Old Isleworth and the surrounding neighbourhoods will be able to buy fresh bread, fish, olives, fruit and vegetables, as well as locally produced ale, wine, and coffee beans.

Delicious cakes and pies, and beautiful fresh flowers will complete the line-up, to be found at Shrewsbury Walk, off South Street, on the first and third Saturday of every month.

With live music, a surprise from local craft group the South Street Knitters, and a stall set aside for local charities to raise awareness, the Old Isleworth Market is sure to be a huge boost to the community.

The market has been kindly sponsored by Inspiring Isleworth, the Isleworth Society, Oakhill estate agents, Sunvil travel agents and Bellway Homes.

Andy Walker, Partner at Oakhill estate agents said, "We are thrilled to support the Old Isleworth community in this wonderful project to enable people to shop locally and sustainably on our thriving high street."

Brenda Daly, owner of Daly Bread said, "This is going to be a fantastic way for our community to come together and I can't wait to bring my fresh, locally produced bread to the market, alongside my fellow stall holders."

Local food producers and voluntary groups who are interested in taking a stall, and local businesses interested in sponsoring the market, are invited to get in touch with organisers Rowan and Janine by emailing [janine@southstreet.biz](:mailto:janine@southstreet.biz), or by popping into the South Street Caf&#233;.
