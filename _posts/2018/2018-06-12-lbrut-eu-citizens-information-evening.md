EU citizens living in the borough are encouraged to attend a free Public Information Evening on the 11<sup>th</sup> July to get updates on the latest Brexit developments and find out what steps they need to take to protect their future in the UK.

The event is being delivered by Citizens Advice Richmond as part of a package of support, funded by the Council, aimed at enabling EU residents to get impartial, expert advice on nationality matters or the impact of the Government's proposals and options available for them.
