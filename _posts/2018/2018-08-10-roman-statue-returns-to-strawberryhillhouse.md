A planned exhibition at Strawberry Hill House to bring back important masterpieces will include a 1<sup>st</sup> Century Roman Imperial Eagle, on loan from Gosford House in Scotland after the Strawberry Hill Trust received a &pound;5,000 grant from the Council.

The statue is returning to the borough where it was previously kept by Horace Walpole, son of the famous Prime Minister, who bought and rebuilt Strawberry Hill House in the 18<sup>th</sup> century,

Walpole acquired the monumental Eagle in 1743, a year after it was excavated in Rome, and it was considered one of the main pieces of his collection.

Cllr Michael Wilson, Cabinet Member for Equality, Communities and the Voluntary Sector:

> "This exhibition promises to be a celebration of the illustrious past of Strawberry Hill House. I would encourage people to go along and visit the exhibition.

> "I'm delighted that the Council has been able to support this initiative to bring a fantastic piece from the borough's history back home."

Claire Barlow, Head of Development at Strawberry Hill House said:

> "We're delighted that the Civic Pride grant, together with match funding from The Daniel Katz Gallery, London, will enable us to transport and display one of the most important works or art in our forthcoming exhibition Lost Treasures of Strawberry Hill, Masterpieces from Horace Walpole's Collection.

> "The Eagle will be on display to the public, in its original position at Strawberry Hill, as part of a major loans exhibition from 20 October 2018 - 24 February 2019.

> "It will also form an integral part of our education programme, with local schools and the wider community encouraged to learn about the history of the objects and the collection."
