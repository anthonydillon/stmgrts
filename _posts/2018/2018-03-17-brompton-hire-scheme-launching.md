Commuters in Richmond upon Thames will have more options available to them following the installation of a Brompton Bicycle Rack outside one of the borough's busiest train stations.

Beginning April 2018 cyclists in Twickenham and those using the station will be able to rent Brompton folding bikes.

As part of the scheme commuters will be able to hire a bike on a daily or weekly basis. All you need to do is register your details online. You can then book a bike online or via text message.

Bicycles can be returned at any time to any Brompton docking station.

Cllr Peter Buckwell, Cabinet Member for Highways and Street Scene said:

> "The Brompton Bike Hire scheme will provide residents and visitors with even more travel options for getting around the borough.

> "They offer fantastic flexibility for combined journeys as they are portable on buses, trains, taxis and cars. Bringing these docking stations to the two busiest stations in our borough will make travelling two and from the stations stress free and encourage more environmentally friendly and healthier travel."

A further installation at Richmond Station is due later this year. Depending on take up, we propose to role the scheme out to other stations across the Borough.
