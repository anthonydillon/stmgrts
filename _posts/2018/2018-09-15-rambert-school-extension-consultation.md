Rambert School of Ballet and Contemporary Dance Weston Studio Extension Drop in consultation sessions Tuesday 18<sup>th</sup> September 4 to 5pm and 6 to 7pm.

Over the last few months we have been working with MICA Architects to explore options for creating additional dance studio space.

Our student numbers have increased in recent years and while we want to keep the School small and intimate in line with the ethos of our founder Marie Rambert, we do also want to ensure that we are providing the best possible facilities for our talented students.

At the end of June, Richmond Council provided us with a response to our pre planning enquiry which demonstrated that an extension to the Weston could be possible. We are now progressing a planning application to extend the Weston Studio next to the Violet Needham Chapel in order to accommodate our full year groups for ballet and contemporary classes.

I am writing to invite you to a drop in consultation session in the Violet Needham Chapel (Monument Studio) on Tuesday 18<sup>th</sup> September between 4-5pm or 6-7pm. Amanda Britton who is the Principal and Artistic Director of Rambert School will be available to answer any questions and James Kirk from MICA Architects will be available to explain our plans.

Please do let us know if you are unable to attend on the 18<sup>th</sup> September and would prefer an alternative date, as I'd be very happy to arrange an alternative time to explain our plans with you.
