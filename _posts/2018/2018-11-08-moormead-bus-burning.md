Council slams dangerous, senseless school bus burning

Vandals who set fire to a school bus in St Margarets overnight should face the full weight of the law for their dangerous, and senseless behaviour.

Councillors and Council officers were alerted to the burning school van overnight and have been working with the police and the vehicle's owner on the investigation and clean up.

The incident follows several acts of anti-social behaviour in the borough including damage to Park benches which have occurred over the last couple of weeks.

Cllr Gareth Roberts, Leader of Richmond Council said:

> "Mindless and criminal acts of this nature simply won't be tolerated in this borough.


> "This can't simply be written off as 'anti-social behaviour', it was an act of arson which posed a serious risk to the safety of the area and to local residents.


> "Let me be very clear, the Council will be working closely with local Police to ensure the individuals involved are caught and feel the full weight of the law. Furthermore, we will be contacting both the Mayor of London and the South West BCU Commander to demand action be taken to make sure Richmond residents are given the police protection they need."
