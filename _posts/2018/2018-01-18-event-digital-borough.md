*Join us on our journey to being a truly digital borough*

New and aspiring tech entrepreneurs are being encouraged to attend a special event to explore key tech trends and issues, showcase the borough's digital and tech pace-setters, and stimulate engagement between business and others.

It further builds on the Council's ambition to make Richmond upon Thames a truly Digital borough. Attendees will hear from industry leaders about how tech companies can meet the challenges of finance, Brexit, adaptation and using the 'Internet of Things', by connecting devices over the internet, letting them talk to us, applications, and each other, particularly at the local community or borough level via the SmartBoroÂ® approach.

Cllr Gareth Elliott, Richmond Council's Cabinet Member for Digital will speak about the Council's ambitions for creating a digital first borough. There will also be a question and answer panel focusing on infrastructure, talent, incubation and co-working space, finance, tech cluster and data.

The event will be held at Clarendon Hall, York House from 2pm to 7pm on Tuesday 27 February 2018.

Cllr Elliott said:

> "Our ambition is for Richmond upon Thames to be a leading local authority in the fast paced and changing world of digital. More of the Council's services are now online and business is increasingly being conducted in the digital space. This presents an enormous opportunity for the borough's entrepreneurs, start-ups and tech sector.

> "We want to encourage businesses to build on the foundations of an already well connected and highly skilled borough so they can take advantage of the opportunities which will become available over the next few years to make Richmond a hub for the digital economy.

> "Bringing people together to share ideas, and learn from successes and failures is a fantastic way to stimulate co-operation and growth in the borough's tech sector. I'm sure the day will be full of stimulating discussion and I look forward to seeing you all there."
