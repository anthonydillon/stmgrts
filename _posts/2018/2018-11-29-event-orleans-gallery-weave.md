An innovative exhibition exploring the concept of sound and tapestry has arrived at Orleans House Gallery.

The British Tapestry Group: Sound and Weave / Rhythm of the Weave is expected to transform woven tapestry away from a two-dimensional historical document towards an imaginative, and more multi-disciplinary approach through sounds and distorted dialogue.

The free exhibition is now on show at the Stables Gallery until Sunday 24 February 2019.

Cllr John Coombs, Richmond Council Cabinet Member for Arts, Culture and Sports, said:

> "The British Tapestry Group exhibition will be a unique and through-provoking for visitors to see the traditional craft come to life in a new sense. I encourage everyone to visit Orleans House Gallery this weekend and not miss out on this free exhibition."


[Orleans House Gallery](https://www.orleanshousegallery.org/) is open Tuesday to Sunday, 10am to 5pm. Admission to the Gallery is free.
