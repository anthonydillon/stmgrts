Richmond upon Thames College, one of London's leading colleges of general and further education, is pleased to announce that it has exchanged contracts on the sale of 4.8 acres of land on the college's existing site in Egerton Road, Twickenham to Clarion Housing. The sale of this land enables Richmond upon Thames College to progress with its ambitious redevelopment plans to build a new state of the art college campus on the site's remaining land, adjacent to the A316 opposite the world famous Twickenham Rugby Ground and less than 10 minutes walk from Twickenham Station.

Robin Ghurbhurun, Principal and CEO of Richmond upon Thames College, said:

> "I am delighted that we have exchanged on the sale of the land and I would like to congratulate Clarion on acquiring such a great site for much needed affordable housing in the area".


> "The sale of land to Clarion ensures that Richmond upon Thames College is now in a strong financial position to realise its plans and develop a state of the art new college campus as part of the Richmond Education and Enterprise Campus".


> "This innovative campus will comprise new high tech college buildings, a new secondary school (the Richmond upon Thames School), purpose-built accommodation for Clarendon School and a new 'tech hub' and digital media incubator for Haymarket Media Group. The campus will benefit people in the local and regional area by offering first class education and training along with a wide range of excellent facilities that will be available to the wider community".


> "The new campus will help establish Richmond upon Thames College as a leading college for careers, with an outstanding reputation for services to learners and employers. Alongside learners and businesses, the wider community will benefit from this development and be able to take advantage of many new facilities including a spa, wellness centre and fitness studio, theatre, art gallery, business incubation spaces and a fine dining restaurant with views over Twickenham.


> "Clarion specialises in providing affordable housing and the new homes on the Twickenham site will help contribute to London's growing demand for affordable housing.  At the end of 2019, the college will move out of its existing buildings into the new college campus at which time demolition work will begin on the old college buildings to make way for a new high quality housing development".


Philip Browne, New Business and Partnerships Director for Clarion Housing, said:

> "We are pleased to have exchanged contracts on these two sites which will enable us to deliver a total of 180 much-needed affordable homes.

> "We are working collaboratively with Richmond upon Thames College and are playing a key role in enabling the redevelopment of the college campus."
