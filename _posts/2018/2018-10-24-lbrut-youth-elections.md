h4. Your Right - Your Vote: Young people needed to shape their local area

If you think you have what it takes to represent the voices of 15,000 young people living in Richmond, then maybe you should consider registering to run in the Richmond and Kingston Youth Elections 2018.

Time is rapidly running out to register to become a candidate to stand in the Youth Council and UK Youth Parliament elections. The deadline is Monday 5 November 2018 and the elections takes place o​in March next year.

You can stand as a candidate for the Richmond or Kingston Youth Council or ​UK ​Youth Parliament if you:

* Live, work or go to school or college or youth club in either borough
* Are aged between eleven (in year 7) and 19 (or 25 if you have a disability)

The​ Youth Council is a group of young people who ensure the voices of children and young people aged between 11 and 19 years are heard and acted upon. In Richmond, the Youth Council is elected by approximately 1,200 young people each year to proactively represent the views of children and young people to those who make key decisions.

The present ​Youth Council's three goals for their term in office are:

* To improve the mental health of young people in Richmond upon Thames
* To create an awareness around substance misuse and the impact it can have on lives and society
* To create greater awareness of sex education including child exploitation, STI prevention and abusive relationships.

There is one member of the UK Youth Parliament for each borough and local authority area across the UK. They take part in workshops, debate, create and change national manifesto policy and network. Once a year they have an annual sitting in the House of Commons chaired by John Bercow MP, Speaker of the House of Commons.

Richmond Council's Cabinet Member for Schools and Youth Services, Cllr Penny Frost, said:

> "Members of Richmond Youth Council and Parliament work fervently each year to find out the views of young people in order to establish a clear picture of their issues, aspirations and concerns.


> "They represent what matters to our young people and they make their voices heard at a national and local level. Sitting as a representative on either Council is a thoroughly worthwhile activity and allows our most civic minded of young people the chance to shine at an early age."
