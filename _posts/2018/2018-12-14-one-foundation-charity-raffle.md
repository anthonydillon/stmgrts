One of the UK's leading clean water charities, The One Foundation, have today launched a new charity fundraising initiative for Christmas - London's Big Charity Christmas Raffle - which will run until 4pm on Christmas Eve.

The raffle will provide a unique opportunity to give back during the season of goodwill; 884 million people in the world still do not have access to clean, safe drinking water, and funds raised from the raffle will provide clean water and sanitation to those who need it most.

To raise awareness and important funds, The One Foundation has partnered with some of London's best restaurants, brands and experiences to offer over 40 prizes as part of the raffle draw. These include Hawksmoor, Belmond Trains, Kew Gardens, Natural History Museum, Pukka Tea & many more.

A list of the prizes up-for-grabs can be found on London's Big Charity Christmas Raffle, and include:

- A steam train fine-dining experience
- Dinner at Michelin-starred restaurant, Trishna
- A day out at Sandown Racecourse
- Afternoon tea for two

All prizes have been kindly donated to the charity from the respective brands taking part.

As well as encouraging individuals to buy raffle tickets as a way of giving back this Christmas, it's hoped that the tickets will also be bought as an alternative gift or stocking filler by those wishing to make a difference through their purchases this Christmas.

Proceeds raised from the raffle will support The One Foundation work towards its vision: a world in which every one has access to clean and safe water, forever. So far they have raised &pound;19.3 million for sustainable clean water and sanitation projects, reaching 3.5 million people worldwide by investing in programmes that deliver lasting change to global communities. Their goal is to raise &pound;20 million by 2020.
