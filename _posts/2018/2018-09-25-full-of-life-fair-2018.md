Twickenham RFU Stadium is set to be full of fun, full of dancing, full of information and full of life, as the annual Full of Life Fair returns to town on Friday 26 October.

Registration is now open for the free event (for residents over 55), which aims to promote healthy and independent living, tackle isolation and loneliness, and enhance digital skills.

The Fair offers the chance to get advice and learn about activities and opportunities available in the borough. Visitors can also try activities including bowls and dancing, as well as listen to talks and take part in a number of arts and crafts sessions, ranging from painting to making the most of digital devices like tablets and smart phones.

A free caf&#233; will be open all day for visitors, and there is also a free lunch for those that register in advance*. In the afternoon, residents can join in the Tea Dance or enjoy other music and dance performances.

You can visit over 70 stalls run by local and regional organisations, including RUILS, Richmond Ramblers and Twickenham Rotary Club, who can provide attendees with information and advice about the services available in the borough.

Registration is essential if you are attending between 10am - 12:30pm, as well as for those wanting to have lunch. Lunch spaces are limited, so get in quick!

Cllr Piers Allen, Cabinet Member for Adult Social Services and Health, said:

> "We know how popular this event is every year, and once again we've got a great range of stallholders lined up to offer advice and support to our attendees. So if you want to attend, please register by going online or calling the Council."


Full of Life takes place at Twickenham RFU Stadium, Whitton Road, TW2 7BA, Friday 26 October, 10am-4pm

A shuttle bus service will also be available between Twickenham Station and the RFU stadium all day.

* The free lunch is available for residents of the Borough of Richmond Upon Thames only. Pre-booking is essential as limited numbers are available. Tickets will be allocated on a first-come, first-serve basis.
