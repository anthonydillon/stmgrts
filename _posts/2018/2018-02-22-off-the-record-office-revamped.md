A local Twickenham charity that provides confidential support and counselling services for young people in the borough will have revamped facilities, thanks to funding from Richmond Council.

Off the Record, based in Church Street, Twickenham, provides counselling from trained volunteer councillors, and a sexual health clinic staffed by a nurse for young people aged 11-24 years.  Every year they help over 1,000 young people.

The charity has received &pound;5,000 towards the internal refurbishment of their premises including paying for the carpets, new furniture, moveable fittings and fire alarms.  Much of the current internal facilities were over 20 years old and urgently needed updating.

The Council's Civic Pride Fund is available to individuals or groups who want to organise a project or event to improve their local area and deliver more for their local communities. Grants of up to &pound;5k are available to organisations and &pound;1k for individuals.

Cllr David Linnette, Richmond Council Cabinet Member for Voluntary Services, said:

> "The mental wellbeing of children and young people is a growing issue across the country.

> "Off the Record is a vital local charity that provides key support services and sexual health advice to hundreds of young people across the borough. It is important that their facilities are fit for purpose and I am glad that we have been able to help."


Sophie Adam, Chair, from Off the Record, added:


> "We are delighted to have received this grant from Civic Pride towards the much needed refurbishment of our premises. The young people who use the service are thrilled with the new look and feel of the project"
