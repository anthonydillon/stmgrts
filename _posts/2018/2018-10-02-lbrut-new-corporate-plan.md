We must work together to make Richmond the best borough in London.

Improving local air quality, supporting the most vulnerable and safer roads are just three of the priorities for the Council over the next four years.

The new Corporate Plan sets out the Council's strategic direction, commitments and priorities, that together will deliver the new Administration's commitment to make Richmond upon Thames a greener, safer and fairer borough.

The new plan includes deliverable targets around the four main priorities - including;

* **A Greener Borough** - putting the environment at the heart of local decision making and safeguarding our beautiful borough;
* **A Safer Borough** - working with the Police to make Richmond safest borough in London;
* **A Fairer Borough** - investing in good local services that protect the most vulnerable and making the borough affordable for all
* **A Borough for Everyone** - making sure that we have a borough for everyone and all residents have a real say over issues that affect them.

At the heart of the plan is the Council's commitment to 'Stand up' for Richmond residents. With an invigorated commitment to demand a better funding deal from the Government, lobby the Government for a People's Vote over Brexit and support local EU residents, continue to fight any expansion of Heathrow airport and push for more affordable housing across the borough.

All of this will be delivered by a Council which is committed to being more open and transparent when it comes to decision making, giving people a real say over decisions that impact them and by working in partnership with communities and local organisations to deliver services.

Cllr Gareth Roberts, Leader of Richmond Council, said:

> "I have been clear that we are committed to making Richmond upon Thames a greener, safer and fairer borough. That means we need to invest in good quality local services, whilst also protecting the most vulnerable.

> "This is going to be a tough ask. Our finances continue to be squeezed. The Government has stripped our funding, with no regard to the rise in demand for some of our most important services, such as Adult Social Care and support for children with special educational needs and disabilities.

> "We want to work with residents and our partners to tackle these challenges head on. We put a premium on our relationship with local people.

> "Together we will make Richmond upon Thames the best borough in London - one that is defined by its green character, safe streets, vibrant businesses, outstanding schools. One that is affordable to all and everyone has a chance to have a high quality of life.

> "To do this we must listen, understand the needs and preferences of local communities and deliver our priorities together."
