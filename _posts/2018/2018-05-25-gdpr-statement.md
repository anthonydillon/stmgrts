The new European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) goes into effect on 25 May 2018. In fact, it has been pretty hard not to have noticed.  We have been receiving dozens of emails daily for several months.

While the St Margarets Community Website is not a company or charity, we can assure you that we are in full compliance with GDPR. In fact, we have always complied and have always collected the least amount of information possible. And to make it completely transparent as to how and what we do with the data we collect, we have published a [new data privacy page](https://stmargarets.london/privacy/) that you can find on the footer of the website.

If you want to unsubscribe to the newsletter, you may do so via any email, or [through the website](https://stmargarets.london/cgi-bin/newsletter.cgi).  If you want to remove your forum account, you will have to email us at: [admin@stmgrts.org.uk](mailto:admin@stmgrts.org.uk).

Thank you for being a St Margarets Community Website reader.
