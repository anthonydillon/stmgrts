The Cabinet Member for Children and Schools joined an East Twickenham charity and their end of term summer fun-day this week, to meet with children and young people with disabilities and additional needs.

Me too &amp; Co provides a supportive and active community for children with disabilities and additional needs. They care for the whole family, providing opportunities to join in, develop and feel empowered through events and activities that work towards removing the isolation.

Cllr Penny Frost, joined the charity and a large number of young people for an end of term musical feast to learn more about their services.

She said:

> "What a fantastic day! I was so pleased to see the large number of young people and their families. Where else could you enjoy bubbles, drumming and a massage all in one afternoon, not to mention a singalong with ukuleles.


> "Me too &amp; Co are a charity that support over 600 local families. They offer activities, therapies and training workshops, not just for children, but also their families and carers.


> "I really enjoyed spending time with them and meeting many of the young people that they help. I look forward to working with the charity in the future."


Jennifer Peters, Chair, from Me too &amp; Co, added:

> "We were delighted to share our session with Cllr Penny Frost and give her the opportunity to see first-hand the important work we do. The need for the services and support we deliver to the local community has never been higher. We welcome new families every week that really need our support. We're looking forward to a close relationship with Cllr Frost and wish her the best of luck with her role."
