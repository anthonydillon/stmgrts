The Planning Application outlining plans for the future of Twickenham Riverside, has been withdrawn, subject to a review of the proposals.

In March, a Planning Application received local approval for the redevelopment of Twickenham Riverside. However, following the local elections in May, the new administration called for a review of the proposals and requested that the application is withdrawn.

Over the coming weeks, the Council will set out a proposal to review the brief for developing this important site, and a programme of engagement with residents and businesses in the Autumn.

A new Planning Application would hopefully be submitted early 2019.

Cllr Gareth Roberts, Leader of Richmond Council, said:

> "We cannot underestimate the importance of this site, and that proposals should respond to the needs of the community as much as possible and not just the needs of the Council.


> "A lot of consultation has already been carried out. We know many local people have invested a lot in giving their feedback. But, we want to ensure that everyone's views have been heard - especially in relation to parking and the integration of any development with Diamond Jubilee Gardens.


> "Over the next few weeks we will develop our approach and anticipated consultation in the early Autumn. We have one shot to get this right. We can do better. Let's be ambitious for Twickenham, together."
