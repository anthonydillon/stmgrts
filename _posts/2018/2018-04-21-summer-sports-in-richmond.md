Sprint into summer with one of Richmond's super sports programmes

If you're looking to sprint into summer with a healthier outlook on life try out one of the sports programmes available across the borough's sports centres.

The summer programmes last up to 12 weeks and are available at each of the borough's six sports centres.

Adults and children alike are encouraged to get involved with activities ranging from judo and karate to badminton to football and cricket to roller disco and street dance.

This year's programme also includes brand new children's gymnastics courses at Teddington Sports Centre and Whitton Sports and Fitness Centre.
