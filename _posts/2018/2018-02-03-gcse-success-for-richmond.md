Richmond Council has again congratulated local schools following the publication of this year's final GCSE results. Results show an improvement in most schools, despite the new, tougher tests in English and Mathematics.

Published today, updated figures show that 76% of pupils achieved a grade four or above in English and Mathematics, which is roughly equivalent to the old C grade or above. This represents an increase of 5% points since the similar measure last year and is above the national average of 64%. 58% also secured a 'good' pass in both subjects, achieving a grade 5 or above, the fifth highest of any local authority nationally.

The English Baccalaureate, which now uses the higher grade 5 or above in English and Mathematics, is also above the national average, with 40% of pupils in Richmond and 21% of pupils nationally doing so. This leave Richmond ranked third of all local authorities nationally in this measure.

The progress 8 score, which measures the progress made by pupils from their different starting points across eight qualifications, is also above national average, standing at +0.14.

Cllr Susan Chappell, Richmond Council Cabinet Member for Schools, said:

> "This is another marker of the continued improvement in Richmond's secondary schools, their staff and, of course, their students.

> "I would like to congratulate all those receiving their results and take the opportunity to thank their families and teachers for their support in a year where we have seen new grading structures in English and Mathematics.

> "It is great, yet again to see how well our schools have performed, setting firm foundations for our students' aspiring futures."
