Join us over the October Half Term where we will be taking inspiration from The Big Draw and exploring the art of play! Take part in our Playful Portraits Project consisting of three fun workshops; People in 2D!, People in 3D! and People in Mystery!, where children will explore a range of techniques to capture characteristics and features of real and imaginary characters.

Children can take part in one, two, or all three of the workshops, though they must be booked separately.

Or join us for a half day workshop with Nature Play! to explore mark making with natural tools, and create your own cheeky character!
