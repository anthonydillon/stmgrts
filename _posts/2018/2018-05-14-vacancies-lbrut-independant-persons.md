Civic minded person sought to maintain standards of public life in Richmond and Wandsworth.

Do you care about your community? Want to make sure our elected representatives adhere to the standards we expect of them? Why not become an official 'independent person'?

Richmond Council and Wandsworth Council are looking for independent persons to assist in promoting and maintaining standards of conduct amongst our elected councillors and co-opted members.

If you are interested, and able to review information to reach evidence based conclusions, have strong personal ethics and high standards of probity you are encouraged to apply before the 21<sup>st</sup> May 2018 deadline.

Jon Evans, Assistant Chief Executive (Policy and Performance) said:

> "The independent persons will support the work of the Councils' Standards Committees in ensuring the conduct of our elected representatives remains exemplary.

> "On occasion this may also require them to consider complaints against members and to advise members and officers of appropriate action to be taken in the event of a complaint.

> "If you are keen to contribute to upholding the standards of public life in our boroughs I encourage you to apply."

Please note that current and/or former councillors, co-opted members or employees of either council, or their close relatives are not eligible for these positions.
