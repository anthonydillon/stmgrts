A second free public information evening for EU citizens living in the borough will be held at York House on 11<sup>th</sup> September 2018.

Attendees will be able to get updates on the latest Brexit developments and find out what steps they need to take to protect their future in the UK.

This is the second such event delivered by Citizens Advice Richmond as part of a package of support, funded by the Council, aimed at enabling EU residents to get impartial, expert advice on nationality matters or the impact of the Government's proposals and options available for them.

Cllr Gareth Roberts, Leader of Richmond Council said:

> "We as a Council are committed to providing our EU friends, neighbours, and family who live in the borough with as much support and information we possibly can.

> "With the sheer amount of news, and changing narratives around Brexit it can be hard to know where you stand as an EU citizen in the UK.

> "These events will update you on the most important developments, and give you impartial advice on the steps you can take to secure your future in the UK. If you weren't able to come along last time I hope you can attend this time around."

* Further advice and support for EU citizens in the borough is available on the Citizens Advice website - [www.citizensadvicerichmond.org/eu-citizens-brexit/](https://www.citizensadvicerichmond.org/eu-citizens-brexit/)
