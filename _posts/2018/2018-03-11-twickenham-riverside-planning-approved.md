Following lengthy debate last night the application to redevelop Twickenham Riverside was approved by the Planning Committee.

On Wednesday 7<sup>th</sup> March, the Committee discussed an application to redevelop 1, 1A, 1B and 1C King Street; 2-4 Water Lane; the site of the former swimming pool building at the corner of Water Lane and the Embankment; and river facing parcel of land on the Embankment in front of Diamond Jubilee Gardens, Twickenham.

The Committee heard from speakers both for and against the proposal. After considering all the representations, the Committee voted in favour of the proposal (five votes to three), subject to a number of conditions. These include submission and approval of a Construction Method Statement, an events management plan, precise materials and full details of the soft landscaping works.

The application proposes a building on King Street / Water Lane and a second building facing the Embankment and Diamond Jubilee Gardens with a wide open space facing onto the River. In addition, designs include a colonnade at King Street, convex steps leading from the Embankment to the site, a square that can be used for community activities, markets, performances and outside dining and new informally landscaped access from the Embankment up to Diamond Jubilee Gardens.

The designs were developed following two years of substantial community consultation and engagement.

However, following an objection raised by the Environment Agency, raising their concerns regarding flood defences - the application will now be considered by the National Planning Casework Unit, with an outcome expected over the next few weeks.

Cllr Pamela Fleming, Richmond Council Cabinet Member for Environment, said:

> "The pool closed in 1981 and since then the old pool buildings have blighted this beautiful stretch of the Riverside. There have been many failed schemes but the one we put forward last night to create a new heart for Twickenham was different because it had been developed with the community. I am delighted it has been approved and would like to thank all those who have contributed.

> "Over the past few years we have worked really hard to make sure the designs reflect the community vision for Twickenham. We know how passionate people are about this site and I hope we can now work together to make these proposals a reality that will benefit Twickenham for years to come.

> "I hope that the National Planning Casework Unit will review the proposals as soon as possible so we can all move forward and create a development that we can all be proud of."
