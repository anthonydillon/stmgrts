It's that time of year again as we look towards summer and the film camp. As always the setting is the Falcons Prep. The films made on our Summer Film Camps feature great heroes and anti-heroes, goodies and baddies, exciting chases and dramatic scenes - all scripted, filmed and directed by young people aged 8 - 18.

Our summer 5 day Film Camp starts on Monday 9<sup>th</sup> July.

Children come up with their own idea for a film, and then set about shooting, directing and editing it over the five days under expert tuition from industry professionals. Each child gets to play all the different roles from actor to director and editor. It's all great fun but good learning too and young wannabee filmmakers finish the course equipped to make their own movies.

Sponsored by the Alpha  Plus Group, the Camp takes place at Falcons Boys Prep School in Richmond and runs for 5 weeks from July 9<sup>th</sup> starting at 9am.

The dates are as follows:

* July 9<sup>th</sup>, 16<sup>th</sup>, 23<sup>rd</sup> and 30<sup>th</sup> and August 13th
