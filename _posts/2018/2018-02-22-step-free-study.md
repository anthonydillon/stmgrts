*Richmond Council will fund feasibility study for step-free access at St Margarets Station*

A feasibility study will be carried out looking at the possibility of introducing level step-free access from the street to the train station in St Margarets.

Currently, St Margarets is considered by National Rail as an "inaccessible station". Access to platforms is only available from St Margarets Road and then via steps. Therefore those with mobility issues, in wheel chairs or with push chairs find it difficult to use the station.

In addition, train travellers living on Amyand Park Road and in the Winchester Road area, many of which live parallel to the Twickenham bound platform, have to walk the length of the road to enter the station.

Residents and councillors have for some time been urging Network Rail to consider installing street level access from Amyand Park Road to the Twickenham bound platform.

Following a meeting with Network Rail, the Leader of the Council and Cabinet Member for Highways and Street Scene, all have agreed that the Council will fund a feasibility study investigating the costs and details of providing step-free access.

It is planned for the study to commence later this year.

Cllr Peter Buckwell, Cabinet Member for Highways and Street Scene, said:

> "St Margarets is one of the key local stations in the borough. Thousands of people use the station every day to commute into London or beyond.

> "In today's society it is unacceptable to have a train station that isn't open to all. I know that Network Rail is continuously looking at ways to improve accessibility at their stations, but they have no budget to cover St Margarets. Therefore, we have agreed to fund a feasibility study to look at the possibility of providing step-free access.

> "This would not only improve access for those with mobility issues, wheel chairs or prams, but also provide a more convenient entrance to the station for those who live so close to the Twickenham bound platform."
