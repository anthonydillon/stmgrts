New and existing users of the Council's Garden Waste Service are encouraged to sign up or renew their contract now and they will pay nothing until November.

Residents who pay the yearly subscription receive a large wheeled green bin in which to put grass cuttings, old garden or house plants, twigs and leaves, hedge trimmings and weeds. The bin will be collected every other week and the contents turned into compost.

The annual contract runs from 1 November 2018 until 31 October 2019 but all customers who apply now will receive their bin and sticker within 10 working days - paying nothing until the Autumn.

Current customers can also benefit from this offer, as if they renew their contract now they will also get free collections over the summer until November.

Residents who only occasionally need the service, are reminded that they can also take garden waste to the Townmead Road Recycling Centre, or buy garden sacks online, from borough libraries, the Civic Centre or at Townmead. No subscription for the sack collection is needed.

Cllr Martin Elengorn, Richmond Council Cabinet Member for Environment, said:

> "Thousands of residents already subscribe to this service. And last year we collected hundreds of tonnes of garden waste, which has all been turned into compost.

> "Home composting is the most sustainable option but those residents who can't do this can take their garden waste to Townmead for no charge, or use our paid for collection service."
