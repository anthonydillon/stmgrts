Residents are being invited to have their say on the Council's new Local Implementation Plan (LIP), which outlines how it intends to deliver the Mayor of London's Transport Strategy in Richmond upon Thames.

The Plan outlines how the Council will work towards making our streets cleaner, greener, safer and healthier for everyone who uses them so that more people choose to make journeys on foot, by bicycle or on public transport.

It also outlines the policies the Council will implement to assist in reaching the Mayor's aim that the vast majority of trips are made on foot, by cycle or on public transport by 2041.

Cllr Alexander Ehmann, Cabinet Member for Transport, Streetscene and Air Quality said:

> "We are committed to supporting our residents in making sustainable transport choices for the majority of their trips and aim to have 75 per cent of trips in Richmond completed on foot, by cycle or public transport by 2041.


> "This plan sets out how the borough intends to meet that target and the wider objectives set out in the Mayor's strategy. It is part of a number of measures that the administration is undertaking to make this borough greener and healthier for everyone who lives here.


> "If you would like to have your say on the plans I urge you to do so before the deadline."
