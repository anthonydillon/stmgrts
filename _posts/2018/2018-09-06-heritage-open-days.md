Heritage Open Days is England's largest festival of history and culture, bringing together over 2,500 organisations, 5,000 events and 40,000 volunteers. Every year in September, places throw open their heritage, community and history. It's your chance to see hidden places and try new experiences - and it's all free.

This year to celebrate the Gallery's restoration and refurbishment we are launching two new free tours: Extraordinary Women and a Heritage Tour of Orleans House.

#### Heritage Tour

* 8, 9, 15 & 16 September at multiple times.

The perfect tour to discover the stories that are hidden in the walls of this Grade 1 listed building, and delve into the lives of the people who made, lived in and saved this hidden Twickenham gem. With French Kings, Hanoverian Queens, Scottish Architects and even some poodles, our friendly volunteer guides will tell you all!

#### Extraordinary Women Tour

* 15 & 16 September at multiple times.

Orleans House Gallery has been influenced, shaped and saved by extraordinary women. This tour brings these influential women's stories to life for the first time. Hear tales of women-only banquets, not-so-secretive mistresses, pioneering female artists, and eccentric heroines.
