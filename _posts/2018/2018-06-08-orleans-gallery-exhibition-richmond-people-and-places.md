An exhibition celebrating the history, people and places of Richmond upon Thames through portraits and landscapes is now open.

The 'Richmond: People and Places' open exhibition is running at Orleans House Gallery until the 19<sup>th</sup> August.

When you do visit be sure to vote for your favourite artwork. The work with the most votes each week will be featured on the Gallery's Facebook page!

The exhibition features artists from the area and further afield, including well-known established artists such as Cathy Cooper, Jill Story and Nicky Browne, alongside emerging artists such as Anushka Bate who is only 10 years old but shows great talent and style!

Cllr John Coombs, Cabinet Member for Arts, Culture and Sport said:

> "There will be more than fifty contemporary works on display by local and national artists and in a variety of media forms.

> "The exhibition links in with the Study Gallery's display of the borough's Art Collection works and pays homage to the rich heritage of our borough as well as life in the borough today. I do hope you come along."
