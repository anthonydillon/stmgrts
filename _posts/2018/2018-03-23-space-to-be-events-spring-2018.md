Mindfulness is a practice which involves deliberately bringing your awareness to the present moment with acceptance and non-judgement.  Research suggests that meditation and awareness training can boost the immune system, significantly reduce stress, improve sleep, bolster creativity, reduce the ruminative thinking that leads to anxiety and depression and improve relationships with loved ones and friends.
