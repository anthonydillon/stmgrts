Green fingered residents are being encouraged to take advantage of a further compost giveaway being held later this month.

On Sunday 22 April, Richmond Council, along with West London Waste Authority and Veolia, will be hosting a 'Compost Giveaway' day from 11.00am at Holly Road car park, Twickenham.  There will be 10 tonnes of compost to give away, with residents being able to take home two bags of compost per household for free. A WEEE takeback facility will also be available for residents who want to dispose of any small electrical items they no longer need.

Ishbel Murray, Assistant Director for Environment and Community Services said:

> "This is a great opportunity for environmentally responsible minded residents to collect some free compost and bring their unwanted or broken small electrical items for recycling at the same time.

> "The Council's waste and recycling team, Veolia and West London Waste Authority, will be also on hand to provide general waste and recycling advice and information about composting. We know how much these WEEE recycling days are valued by our residents, with last January's collection being the most successful ever and we hope that this one will be just as successful."

The collection will take place at Holy Road Car Park in Twickenham from 11am until the compost is finished. We are only able to accept small WEEE items that can fit inside a 240 litre household wheelie bin.
