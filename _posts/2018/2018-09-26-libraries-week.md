Richmond's readers are encouraged to celebrate our much-loved libraries by attending one of the events being held for Libraries Week (8-13 October).

As part of the week's programme of events, and to celebrate Black History Month, Teddington Library will host a talk with family historian, Paul Crooks. On Tuesday 9<sup>th</sup> October from 7.00pm to 8.30pm, Paul will chat about tracing his own roots to the backdrop of the British Government's abolition of slavery in the 19<sup>th</sup> century.

Historian Will Bird will be taking attendees at Twickenham Library on an illustrated journey of the ancient world. From 7.00pm to 8.00pm on Wednesday 10<sup>th</sup> October we will be exploring some of the most famous libraries in history, the people who created them and the fate of their priceless collections of knowledge.

And finally, from 2.30pm to 3.30pm on Saturday 13<sup>th</sup> October, Richmond Library Annexe will be hosting a one-woman show straight from the Edinburgh fringe, 'Lucy, Lucy and Lucy Barfield'. This show, aimed at an adult audience, is an intimate look at holding onto adventure, falling through the cracks and finding your own way back as Lucy Grace examines CS Lewis' 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'.

Cllr John Coombs, Cabinet Member for Arts, Culture and Sport said:

> "Our Libraries team have put together a wonderfully diverse collection of events in this annual celebration of our much-loved libraries. If you are interested I encourage you to book now to avoid missing out."
