Local artist, Nick Bridson Baker is returning to the Riverside Gallery twenty-one years after he became the first artist to exhibit there in 1997.

This time he brings a one-man show, 'Fun and Fantasy', of over eighty monotype one-off prints, paintings and drawings.

The exhibition runs at the [Riverside Gallery, Old Town Hall, Richmond from 4<sup>th</sup> August - 27<sup>th</sup> October 2018](https://stmargarets.london/event/exhibition/200705146659).

Cllr John Coombs, Cabinet Member for Arts, Culture and Sport said:

> "It's great to have a local artist returning to a Gallery with which he shares so much history. Nick's quirky, fun work is sure to be a hit with the Gallery's visitors this autumn so why not come on down to Richmond and check it out."


Nick said:

> "I draw from memory, imagination and life. For this exhibition I have chosen a mixed selection of work that I hope is amusing, puzzling, surprising or simply fun."


The Gallery is open Monday - Friday 9.30am-6pm and Saturday 9.30am-4pm.
