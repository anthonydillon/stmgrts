    Join us at Orleans House Gallery for after school art clubs on Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursday for 5-15 year olds.

    Exciting weekly workshops offer budding young artists the opportunity to explore a broad range of artistic media and practice with our experienced gallery artists. Each term brings a varied selection of projects which are explored in group sizes of no more than sixteen, allowing participants to try more messy and adventurous media than may be possible at school.
