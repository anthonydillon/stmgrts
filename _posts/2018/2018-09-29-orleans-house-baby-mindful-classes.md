Baby Mindful is back, in the awe-inspiring beauty of our Octagon Room. Choose from the option of a 4 or 8 week course where you'll spend quiet, quality time learning Mindfulness techniques from a qualified practitioner. Especially tailored to new or expecting parents and their bumps or babies (pre-crawling) this course will enhance bonding between you and your baby, promote calm and offer the opportunity to meet other local parents. Taking inspiration from the visual and emotional impact of the gallery's artworks and surroundings, sessions will include mindful movement, creative mindfulness sessions and guided meditation practice.

The long-term health benefits of practicing Mindfulness include coping strategies, improved sleep, increased focus, deeper relaxation and feeling better equipped to deal with everyday stresses.

Sessions will follow on from our previous Baby Mindful sessions, but it doesn't matter whether you are brand new to mindfulness or well-practiced as the course will be suited to all levels.

Each session will build upon the last and you can choose to book the whole course at a discounted rate, or separate sessions.
