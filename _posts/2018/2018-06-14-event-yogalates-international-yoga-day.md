Craving a little 'me time'?

Join us as we celebrate International Yoga Day with a restorative yoga class next Thursday 21<sup>st</sup> June, 7-9pm, at the ETNA Centre in St Margarets.

Two hours of slow and gentle movement through a series of yin yoga postures will allow you to mentally and physically unwind, reconnecting the body, mind and breath.  The session will also involve mini-massages and conclude with a long and deeply soothing guided meditation. There'll even be some tasty, healthy, homemade treats for afters!
