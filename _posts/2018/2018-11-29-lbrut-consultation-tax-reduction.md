Residents can have their say on Council proposals to axe Council Tax contributions for the most hard-pressed residents.

Earlier this year, Richmond Council agreed that it would consult on proposals to reverse the previous Council policy, where the most financially disadvantaged residents must contribute a minimum of 15% towards their Council Tax.

Until 10 December, residents can have their say on proposals to remove this minimum Council Tax contribution level from next April.

It is estimated that the proposals will benefit around 2,500 residents across the borough, costing the Council &pound;400,000 a year.

Cllr Robin Brown, Richmond Council Cabinet Member for Finance and Performance, said:

> "Since May we have been clear, we will not take from our most disadvantaged residents to balance the Council's books.


> "We have always committed to reversing the previous changes to the Council Tax Reduction Scheme and we are delivering on that commitment. Putting more pressure on financially vulnerable residents who already face genuine hardship isn't fair.


> "Council finances are strained. Our Government funding has been slashed. But, whilst we continue to look after the Council's finances carefully, it will not be at the expense at those who are financially vulnerable."
