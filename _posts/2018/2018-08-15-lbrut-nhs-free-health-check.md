    As we near the end of summer, make sure you take time to check up on your health and wellbeing by booking in for a free NHS Health Check.

    When we get older we have a higher risk of developing conditions like high blood pressure, heart disease or type 2 diabetes. Your free NHS Health Check can spot early signs and help prevent these happening to you which means you'll be more likely to enjoy life for longer.

As we near the end of summer, make sure you take time to check up on your health and wellbeing by booking in for a free NHS Health Check.

When we get older we have a higher risk of developing conditions like high blood pressure, heart disease or type 2 diabetes. Your free NHS Health Check can spot early signs and help prevent these happening to you which means you'll be more likely to enjoy life for longer.

The free service is available to those residents aged between 40 and 74 who live in the borough or are registered with a GP in the borough, who have not been previously diagnosed with diabetes, kidney disease, heart disease or stroke and have not had an NHS Health Check in the last five years.

Cllr Piers Allen, Cabinet Member for Adult Social Services and Health, said:

> "The change of season is a good time for you to take stock of your overall health and wellbeing, particularly as an older resident. Even if you feel great like me, being over forty means your health risks are higher. Knowing what those risks are means you can make changes to your lifestyle to delay or avoid the onset of these diseases.


Eligible residents may receive a Health Check invitation from their GP. They can also contact their GP to find out when their Health Check is due."

Visit our website or contact your GP to find out your eligibility and when your next health check is due. Health checks are also offered at C Goode Pharmacy in King Street, Twickenham and Kanset Pharmacy in Ashburnham Road, Richmond.
