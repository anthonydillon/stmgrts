Cllr Michael Butlin has been appointed as the borough's Armed Forces Champion

The appointment comes in the year we mark the centenary of the end of World War One. Cllr Butlin is a former Army Captain whose two sons have also served in the British armed forces.

As Armed Forces Champion, Cllr Butlin will ensure the Council and the borough continue to stand-by and support the Armed Forces Covenant.

The Covenant is a voluntary statement of support between the civilian and local Armed Forces communities and is intended to complement the national Armed Forces Covenant, which outlines the moral obligation between the country, the Government and the Armed Forces, at the local level.

In his first act as Champion Cllr Butlin proposed the motion, which was adopted, that said:

> "Council supports the Royal British Legion's 'Count Them In' Campaign to have serving forces personnel, veterans and the family members of these groups formally recognised within the national census."

He encourages all residents to support The Royal British Legion in their work for the veterans and their families all year round, particularly during the Poppy Appeal

Cllr Butlin said:

> "As a former service member and someone whose sons have also served I know how valuable support offered to veterans can be.

> "I look forward to working alongside the Legion, our armed services personnel and the many people interested in our military history to celebrate the service our armed forces have given to this country, particularly as we enter the centenary commemorations for the Great War."

Cllr Butlin is a Councillor for South Twickenham Ward.
