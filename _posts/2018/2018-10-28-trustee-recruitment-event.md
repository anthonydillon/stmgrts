*Have You Got What It Takes To Be A Trustee?*

There are literally hundreds of not for profit organisations in our borough that enrich and enliven the local community and they couldn't do it without their trustees. If you would like to support and guide a particular organisation's work, volunteering as a trustee could be perfect for you.

The Richmond CVS Trustee Recruitment Event is designed to give you an insight into what being a trustee really means and offers a unique opportunity to meet and network with organisations. Put the date in your diary and see how you could get involved and contribute as part of a Board or Management Committee.

Join this free event on Thursday 15 November, 6pm to 8pm, at Richmond and Hillcroft Adult and Community College (RHACC), Parkshot, Richmond. For more information on this special event, or volunteering in general, get in touch with [carolinet@richmondcvs.org.uk](:mailto:carolinet@richmondcvs.org.uk).

This event is organised by Richmond CVS in partnership with RHACC.  On Thursday 15 November 2018, 6pm - 8pm at Richmond and Hillcroft Adult and Community College (RHACC), Parkshot, Richmond.
