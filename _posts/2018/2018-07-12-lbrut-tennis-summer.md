    As British tennis stars get their Wimbledon campaign underway this week, why not kick off your own summer of tennis at one of the borough's thirteen tennis sites.

    The Council, in partnership with the Lawn Tennis Association, is offering a family membership scheme which gives the whole family access to our tennis courts. There's also a junior membership package for under-16s, who can book and play tennis for free.

As British tennis stars get their Wimbledon campaign underway this week, why not kick off your own summer of tennis at one of the borough's thirteen tennis sites.

The Council, in partnership with the Lawn Tennis Association, is offering a family membership scheme which gives the whole family access to our tennis courts. There's also a junior membership package for under-16s, who can book and play tennis for free.

Those wanting to get into the competitive spirit can also join one of the three tennis leagues taking place in the borough. The leagues are open to anybody aged 18 and over and are available in Barnes, Hampton or Richmond.

Players are organised into groups of six to eight players and matches can be arranged at mutually convenient times. Any court that suits both players can be used.

Cllr John Coombs, Cabinet Member for Arts, Culture and Sport said:

> "We all know how much of a summer highlight Wimbledon is for people across Britain. I hope that if you are new to tennis, or if you have been thinking about getting back into playing, you'll take inspiration from the pros and pick up a racket.


> "With the good summer weather we are having it's a great opportunity to join a local league, meet new people and get active at the same time."
