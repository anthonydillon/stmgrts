Over 280 pupils moved into their exciting new school building this week, as The Richmond upon Thames School opens its' doors for a second year.

The Richmond upon Thames School is governed by The Richmond upon Thames School Trust, made up of partner organisations including Harlequins FC, Haymarket Media Group, Richmond upon Thames College, Achieving for Children and Richmond Council.

The school is part of the Richmond Education and Enterprise Campus and opened in September 2017, and whilst their new accommodation was being built they were temporarily based inside Richmond upon Thames College.

However, now the work is all complete and the new building is home to 31 classrooms, art rooms, a drama studio, music studio, food and hospitality kitchen, ICT classrooms, science labs, independent learning zone and an innovation classroom.

At the end of last term, the former Year 7 students already became familiar with their new school building, helping move in and hosting an end of year Summer Fair.

Kelly Dooley, Head Teacher, The Richmond upon Thames School, said:

> "Our new building is fantastic. Over the past year the Year 7s have been watching eagerly as their permanent school was built. They visited the site on a number of occasions and are very excited to have finally moved in.


> "It has been a momentous first twelve months. We have achieved a lot and I would like to thank my staffing colleagues, governors, supportive parents and pupils and partner organisations for helping make this all possible."


Cllr Penny Frost, Richmond Council Cabinet Member for Schools, said:

> "This is a very exciting day. Over the past year, The Richmond upon Thames School has become a valued addition to our wider school community, and it is already proving a hit with local parents.


> "Now, with a state of the art building, The Richmond upon Thames School will be able to offer a high standard of education, in an inspiring, innovative and creative environment that will benefit young people for many years to come."
