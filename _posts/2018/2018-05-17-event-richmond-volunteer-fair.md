_Find your volunteer opportunity at Richmond Volunteer Fair_

Are you looking to get more involved and give back to your local community but unsure how you can contribute?

Come along to Richmond's annual Volunteer Fair and find out what opportunities might be best suited to you!

The Fair, organised by the Richmond Council for Voluntary Service (RCVS), is free to attend and takes place from 2pm to 6pm on 7<sup>th</sup> June at Richmond and Hillcroft Adult Community College, Parkshot, Richmond.

Cllr Michael Wilson, Cabinet Member Designate for Equality, Communities and the Voluntary Sector said:

> "We live in an extremely community-minded borough with very high rates of volunteering but we know organisations are always looking for extra hands to help out.

> "People who have volunteered in the past have found it a thoroughly rewarding experience with new connections and skills gained through volunteering having positive effects on their own health and wellbeing,

> "With around fifty local charities and non-profits involved, the annual Volunteer Fair is one of the best ways people who are eager to contribute to their community can find out how they can do that."


Director of Richmond CVS, Kathryn Williamson, said:

> "The Volunteer Fair is the perfect opportunity for local people to talk directly with lots of voluntary groups about volunteering in an informal setting.  Last year's Fair was tremendously successful and we look forward to welcoming more potential volunteers to RHACC on 7<sup>th</sup> June."
