Residents are being asked to help keep the borough's newest trees healthy over the summer, by giving them a bit of water, particularly in light of the recent heat wave.

Over the last two years, the Council has planted over 600 new trees in the Borough's streets, parks and open spaces.

To help the new trees establish and flourish in the borough, the Council is implementing a cycle of maintenance and watering however with the current hot and dry weather set to continue we're asking residents to lend a helping hand.

If there's a new tree planted outside your house please do water it! A five-litre watering can every other day will help to supplement the Council's efforts and allow our trees to thrive.

Cllr Martin Elengorn, Cabinet Member for Environment, Planning and Sustainability said:

> "With a long run of warm, dry weather our new trees need plenty of water so help them establish and grow. Whilst our arboriculture team will be watering them regularly we ask residents also to do their bit by watering any newly planted trees near where they live."
