Residents are being reminded that their collection times will be subject to change over the Christmas and New Year holiday period.

For Christmas week commencing Monday 24 December, Richmond Council will carry out waste and recycling collections from domestic properties on the Monday for normal Monday collections day and two days later than usual for all other collections days.  For example, Tuesday collections will take place on Thursday and the Wednesday collections on Friday.

Collections the following week will take place on Monday 31 December as normal and will then take place a day later than normal after New Years' day. If your collection normally takes place on a Tuesday, your collection will now be on Wednesday 2 January 2019, and for those on a Wednesday the collection will be made on Thursday 3 January 2019.  Normal collection days will resume a week later on Monday 7 January 2019.

Box Deliveries and Special Collections will continue through until Friday 21 December 2018 and will recommence on Wednesday 2 January 2019.

Garden Waste collection will continue until 21 December 2018 and will recommence on Monday 7 January 2019.

Real Christmas Trees will be collected on scheduled garden waste collection days between Monday 7 January and Friday 18 January 2019. Alternatively, you can take your Christmas tree to:

- Household Waste and Recycling Centre, Townmead Road, Kew
- Barn Elms Sports Centre, SW13 0DG (opposite Barnes Rugby Centre)
- Squire's Garden Centre Car Park, Sixth Cross Road, TW2 5PA
- Old Deer Car Park, TW9 2RA
- Ham Street Car Park, TW10 7RS
- Nelson Road Car Park, TW2 7BB
- Hampton Library Car Park, TW12 2AB
- North Lane Car Park, Teddington, TW11 0HJ

Our waste and recycling teams will be working very hard to ensure Christmas and New Years' collections are completed throughout the borough but please be mindful that due to heavy workloads some collection crews may be undertaking collections later than normal.  If you do need to report a missed collection this can be done online [www.richmond.gov.uk/report_a_missed_collection](http://www.richmond.gov.uk/report_a_missed_collection)
