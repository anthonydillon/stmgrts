New and existing businesses in Richmond upon Thames will be helped to grow from strength to strength after a new support programme, commissioned by the Council, launched this week.

'Richmond Enterprise Challenge: Step Up. Start Up. Scale Up' is a new campaign, run by CPG Executive Consulting Ltd, to deliver two support programmes for new businesses in the borough.

The first programme, **'Richmond Foodies'**, will focus on food and food related businesses, which we know is a big and growing sector in the borough. Whilst the second, **'Start Up & Grow Richmond'**, will be aimed at all businesses, including those key borough sectors of technology, and professional services.

Business owners will be able to access online workshops, business growth clinics, CEO round tables, webinars and other online training. As part of the programmes they will also benefit from one to one growth sessions, mentoring and networking opportunities.

Cllr Geoff Acton, Cabinet Member Business, Economy and Employment said:

> "We are delighted to be offering further support to our new and growing businesses in the borough. Supporting entrepreneurs and new business owners to establish their business is particularly important in times of uncertainty which are riskier for start-ups.

> "I hope if you are a new business owner or are looking to start your own business you take advantage of the package of support programmes the Council offers to keep the spirit of entrepreneurship thriving in this borough."
