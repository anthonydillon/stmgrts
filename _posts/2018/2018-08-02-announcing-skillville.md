A couple in Twickenham have built an online platform that allows people within communities to connect in order to learn or teach skills. [Skillville.io](http://www.skillville.io) allows anyone to post any lesson- from gardening, to accounting, from DIY to creative writing. This local duo hopes their new website will encourage people to keep learning at all ages, whilst giving people an opportunity to share their own knowledge, earning extra income and meeting new people along the way. Do you have a skill you would like to share? Post a lesson today for free!

As Henry Ford once said "Anyone who stops learning is old, whether at twenty or eighty. Anyone who keeps learning stays young."
