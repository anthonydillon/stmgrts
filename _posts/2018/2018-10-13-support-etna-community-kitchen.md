Can you help? ETNA needs 250 people to back their community kitchen project by the 15<sup>th</sup> October, to qualify for a grant from the London Mayoral Fund.

Just a small pledge is needed; say &pound;1 or &pound;2, to show you support their crowdfund to create a space where the elderly, the young and those just wanting a chat can come for coffee and an affordable meal.
