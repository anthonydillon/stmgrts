Set your little mischief maker a summer reading challenge!

Have you got a little mischief maker in your house? Set them a Summer Reading Challenge to search for the Beantown buried treasure!

Mischief Makers, Summer Reading Challenge for 4 to 11-year olds runs from 14<sup>th</sup> July to 8<sup>th</sup> September 2018 in celebration of Beano's 80<sup>th</sup> anniversary.

Search the map of Beanotown to find the mysterious buried treasure with extra hints given for each time a child borrows a library book, reads it and returns it to the library. There are six stickers to collect.

Everyone who reads six library books before the closing date of 8 September will be rewarded in the library with a gold medal.

Cllr John Coombs, Cabinet Member for Arts, Culture and Sport said:

> "Keeping children occupied over the long summer break can be challenging, with digital devices often being an easy distraction. Luckily our libraries have got you covered. Why not try something different this summer and get your children reading in celebration of eight decades of Beano!"
