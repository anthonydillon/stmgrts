The wealth of prodigious musical and theatrical talents that exist in Richmond has been packed into an explosive programme of events that are taking place across the borough when the three-week festival comes to town starting on 1 March 2018.

Highlights include the Barnes Community Players performing Say Something Happened; Twickenham Jazz Club hosting Kelvin Christiane All Star Big Band;   Powerjam & Friends - a family friendly event of live youth pop and rock music and movement featuring the talented powerjam bands and dancers from SBA dance, Kew Dance Arts and Boundless Dance. And, Richmond Orchestra with a spring concert of Tchaikovsky, Beethoven and Brahms

The festival will launch with a special opening event on Sunday 4 March at 3pm at the borough's newest art venue - The Exchange in Twickenham. The event will be an afternoon of specially curated music, dance and dramatic excerpts from some of the borough's finest performers, including Twickenham Choral Society and Richmond Music Trust. There will be a dramatic excerpt curated by the Orange Tree Theatre, a duet from students at Rambert School and a rousing finale of musical theatre from local theatre company BROS.

Richmond Council's Cabinet Member for Arts and Culture, Cllr David Linnette, said:

> "I am delighted to raise the curtain on the fourth Richmond upon Thames Music and Drama Festival. The festival continues the tradition of presenting a diverse range of talent which exists within the borough, celebrating the performing arts in all forms. Over three weeks we will be hosting concerts and performances covering a broad spectrum of music, dance and drama.

> "We are proud to be able to showcase just some of the exceptional talent that exists within our wonderful borough and will bring you work from local arts organisations, young people, schools and the Barnes Music Festival, as well as performances from professional and international artists especially for this year's festival.

> "I'd like to encourage as many residents as possible to take full advantage of the wonderful acts and performances being showcased this year and to say a special thanks to our performers and venues for helping make this what I know will be a wonderful event."
