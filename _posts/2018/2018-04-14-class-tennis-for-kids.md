Is your child the next tennis ace? Sign up and find out

A scheme which introduces kids to tennis is back in Richmond upon Thames for another smashing summer.

Tennis for Kids is aimed at kids who have never played before, focusing on fun and combining basic hand eye coordination with basic tennis skills. Sessions are designed to teach kids how to work with a partner and become part of a team, all in a relaxed environment. Parents are also encouraged to join in for the final session which has a 'Family Time' theme.

By signing up to Tennis for Kids, your child will get six introductory coaching sessions, a bespoke racket, set of balls, and personalised T-shirt delivered directly to them for &pound;25.

David Allister, Head of Culture at Richmond Council:

> "We are delighted to have Tennis for Kids back in Richmond for another year, following its introduction in 2015. It's a great way for our youngsters to get introduced to the sport.


> "If you think your child could be the next Andy Murray or Johanna Konta, or are just looking for something fun and active to do this summer book their place and start their tennis journey today!"
