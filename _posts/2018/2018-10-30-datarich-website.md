Richmond Council has relaunched its online resource that aims to help local organisations, groups and businesses understand more about the people who live in the borough and their needs.

DataRich is a website that brings together information from a variety of sources, including; the Office for National Statistics and government departments to create a single resource of data and information to act as an evidence base to improve the decision making of the Council and external organisations.  In addition, the site provides community groups, the voluntary sector and contractors interested in working with the Council with up to date information about the borough. This will help them tailor their procurement or commissioning bids accurately and also allows residents to view trends in their areas.

Data is presented around the key themes of economy and employment, crime, population, health and social care, housing and education and skills amongst others. All areas of the borough are covered, right down to ward level, with information easily accessible in a variety of formats including tables, charts and maps. Users can even build their own reports by different themes and topics.

Cllr Michael Wilson, Cabinet Member for Communities, from Richmond Council, said:

> "Data Rich is the single most complete source of information and intelligence about Richmond upon Thames and its people. It is a great source for useful facts and figures that will help with writing reports and presentations, inform planning, prepare funding applications or support research and evaluations.


> "Data Rich can also be used by students, academics or indeed businesses looking to relocate to the borough and wanting more information about their future customer base. The possibilities are endless."
