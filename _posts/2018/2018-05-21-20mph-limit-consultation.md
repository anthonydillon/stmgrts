    Residents will soon be able to have their say on plans to introduce a borough-wide 20MPH speed limit in Richmond upon Thames.

    The new, borough-wide 20MPH speed limit would replace the existing policy under which 20MPH zones are implemented on a road by road basis following petitions from residents. The petition is then evaluated by officers before a formal consultation begins.

Residents will soon be able to have their say on plans to introduce a borough-wide 20MPH speed limit in Richmond upon Thames.

The new, borough-wide 20MPH speed limit would replace the existing policy under which 20MPH zones are implemented on a road by road basis following petitions from residents. The petition is then evaluated by officers before a formal consultation begins.

Cllr Alexander Ehmann, Cabinet Member Designate for Transport, Streetscene and Air Quality said:

> "As an administration we are committed to working with residents to deliver a 20MPH speed limit across Richmond upon Thames.  My first action as Cabinet Member was to ask Officers to draw up a consultation for a borough-wide 20MPH limit and I am pleased to announce we will be consulting on our proposal in the very near future.

> "The consultation will begin following the summer break so all residents can have a say on our 20MPH limit plans.  I would encourage everyone to have their say on these plans, which should improve road safety and reduce vehicle emissions in Richmond upon Thames!"

The consultation is planned to begin in September 2018.
