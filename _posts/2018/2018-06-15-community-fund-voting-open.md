Richmond Council have reached the public consultation stage of the Community Fund where we encourage Richmond Borough residents to give their support for up to 2 of the 10 projects across the Borough that have successfully passed the first round of validation.

The projects you can vote on are:

* Crane Park Island Nature Trail, Heathfield

* Community Kitchen, East Twickenham
* Playground for Suffolk Rd. Recreation Ground, Barnes
* Feasibility study to enhance St Richard's Square, Ham

* Creation of a youth Centre, Hampton North
* New build of Oldfields Pavilion, Hampton

The polling period is between Monday 18<sup>th</sup> June and Friday 13<sup>th</sup> July and all you need to do is follow this link [www.richmond.gov.uk/consultation_fund](http://www.richmond.gov.uk/consultation_fund), read the project descriptions and then choose up to 2 projects that appeal to you.  Your vote will go towards the final decision to be made by Councillors as to which project are awarded funding in 2018.

Your community projects will really appreciate your support and be able to offer even more opportunities to residents.
