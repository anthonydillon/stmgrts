There are two new sets of Zumba classes running at the ETNA Centre in East Twickenham.

The first is Zumba on Monday evening 6.30pm until 7.15pm no previous experience required for a good fun workout. The second is Zumba Gold for Age UK on Wednesday 1.30pm until 2.30pm no previous experience required for a good fun workout.

Wear clothing suitable for exercise and bring a bottle of water with you. I provide the smiles. Pay as you go so you do not sign up to anything.

* Contact Tara on 07974 948656 if you have any questions
* Classes held at ETNA - 13 Rosslyn Rd, Twickenham TW1 2AR
