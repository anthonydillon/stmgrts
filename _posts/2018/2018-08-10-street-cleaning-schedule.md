A new online interactive tool has been launched to help local people find out when their streets should be cleaned.

The borough's street cleansing contract is outsourced to an external provider, Continental Landscapes and, following feedback, the Council has been discussing with the company how to keep residents better informed.

The Council has now decided to publish the street cleansing schedules on its website to give residents' guidance as to when their local high streets and residential streets will be cleaned.

Cllr Martin Elengorn, Richmond Council Cabinet Member for the Environment, said:

> "We all prefer clean streets. And, in some places we know that our street cleaning service wasn't quite as regular as it might have been.


> "We have been working with Continental on this and residents can now check online to find out when their area should be cleaned.


> " However, we all have a role when it comes to keeping our streets clean. That includes not dropping litter and making sure our waste and recycling bags are sealed and stored away from foxes.


> "Together, we can try to make Richmond the cleanest and greenest borough in London."
