This year's Remembrance Day Services are being held throughout the borough on Sunday, 11 November.

Wherever you are in the borough there will be a service near to you where you can pay your respects to commemorate the contribution of British and Commonwealth military and civilian servicemen and women in the two World Wars and later conflicts.

Most events will consist of a parade of Armed Forces veterans, civic dignitaries and religious officials followed by a service and two minute silence at 11am.

In addition, at 6pm on the 11 November a special commemoration service will be held at St Mary's Church in Twickenham. Led by Reverend Jeff Hopkin Williams, and other faith leaders, the Ecumenical service will mark 100 years since the end of the World War I.

Mayor of Richmond upon Thames, Cllr Ben Khosa, said:

> "This is a time for us to pay our respects to all those who have served our country and been affected by conflict. I hope Richmond upon Thames residents will join myself and other councillors by attending a Remembrance Day service, observing the two-minute silence or wearing a poppy with pride to help raise vital funds for the Poppy Appeal."
