*Oscar nominated screenwriter to answer your questions at Twickenham Studios*

An Oscar nominated screenwriter and award-winning author is to give a VIP public Q & A at Twickenham studios next month - giving an intimate audience a real insight to life in Hollywood, script writing and what it takes to break into the industry.

Nick Hornby is best known for his internationally bestselling novels High Fidelity, About A Boy, How To Be Good, A Long Way Down and Juliet, Naked. His non-fiction books include the football memoir Fever Pitch and The Complete Polysyllabic Spree, a collection of Nick's essays on books and culture. He is also the author of Slam, which is vintage Hornby for teenagers.

A number of his books have also been made into much loved films, including the award winning Fever Pitch, High Fidelity, About a Boy and A Long Way Down. Nick has also scripted the adaptation of Lynn Barber's memoir 'An Education' as well as Brooklyn by Colm Toibin.

He started his career as a journalist, with features published in the Sunday Times, Esquire, Elle, Vogue, GQ, Time Out, Time, the Literary Review and the Independent.

His work frequently touches upon music and sport, and his books have sold more than 5 million copies worldwide as of 2018.

To help raise money for the Mayor of Richmond's three chosen charities, Hornby will be answering questions from an event host and the audience at a special VIP Q and A at Twickenham Studios on 13 March.

Only 60 tickets are available and all attendees will receive a glass of champagne on arrival and canapes.

Cllr Lisa Blakemore, Mayor of Richmond upon Thames, said:

> "What an exciting event. This is not just an opportunity to see inside one of the UK's leading film studios, but also to hear from one of the countries most prized authors and screen writers.

> "So, whether you are a film buff, or writer or football fan - come and hear from Nick Hornby and help raise money for three special charities."


Tickets cost &pound;50. To book or for more information, go to: [www.richmond.gov.uk/mayors_charities](http://www.richmond.gov.uk/mayors_charities)
