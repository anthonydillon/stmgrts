An enhanced, interactive nature trail will be laid on Crane Park Island Nature Reserve following a &pound;4,228 grant from the Council's Community Fund.

London Wildlife Trust is working to improve the island's nature trail by installing numbered oak posts which link to an information map. The posts will have interactive tactile panels which children can use to make rubbings from which will tell them about the history and wildlife of the area.

Cllr Michael Wilson, Cabinet Member for Equality, Communities and the Voluntary Sector said:

> "This project is a great opportunity to encourage children to get outdoors and learn more about the borough's wonderful history and environment. Families will be able to keep active whilst gaining knowledge about the borough, something we are only too happy to support."


Alex Robb, Senior Site & Projects Officer said:

> "London Wildlife Trust would like to thank the Community Fund for their generous grant towards the cost of developing a new nature trail on Crane Park Island Nature Reserve, Whitton.


> "Families will be able to enjoy the self-guided trail, which will incorporate a series of posts with images representing the wildlife of the reserve, from which children will be able to take rubbings. It will be a fun and interactive way for people to be inspired about the wildlife that is on their doorstep."


London Wildlife Trust is one of eight organisations to be awarded funding in the latest round of the Community Fund.
