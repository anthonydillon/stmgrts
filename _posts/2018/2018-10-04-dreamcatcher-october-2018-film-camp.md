excerpt: |
    In a Dreamcatcher film camp, each student writes, shoots, directs, produces and participates in editing a short film within a small group.  The camps focus on the fundamental elements of visual storytelling that enable the participants to shoot a short film in 5 days. It is very "hands on".
