Senior citizens from St Margarets and the wider Richmond borough celebrated Christmas early, thanks to an annual Christmas dinner even provided by the St Margarets Fair organising committee, held at the Turks Head Pub on Wednesday, 5 December.

The St Margarets Fair is an annual event held on Moormead, St Margarets every summer.   Now in its 41<sup>st</sup> year, the event, which attracts over 5,000 people, is a fantastic day out for the whole community in the height of summer.

Some of the money raised at this year's Fair ensured that 70 senior citizens had an evening to remember this Christmas period. Local resident Eileen said;

> "The event is very good, excellent!  The decorated hall is lovely! You really can't fault it, can you?  I think the dinner this year was even better than last year".

The evening was also used as an opportunity to distribute funds raised by the fair to the five local schools the Fair supports (Orleans Primary, St Mary's C of E Primary, St Stephen's C of E Primary, Orleans Park & Deer Park School).

Additionally, there were representatives from local charities who were also successful in receiving funds raised by the Fair. The charities supported this year include The ETNA Centre (East Twickenham Neighbourhood Association), Off the Record Twickenham and Marble Hill Playcentres.

Additional donations were also given to Oxford Gardens Primary School, near Grenfell Tower; and the Young Care Leavers Dinner Organising Committee.  On 25 December 2018 a very special Christmas dinner will be held for young people who have grown up in care, haven't got families to go to, and would otherwise face Christmas alone.

Becky Ellison from the St Margarets Fair Committee said "the senior citizens dinner is an important date in our calendar as it provides an opportunity for people in our local community to come together and celebrate Christmas.  For some of our guests this might be their only opportunity to see friends and have a night out to remember.  We are also delighted to be able to give support to the local schools and selected charities again this year.  We know how important these funds are and the support they give to our wider community.  Our thanks also go to all of the staff at the Turks Head, the choir and photograher who make this event such a special one".

Next year's Fair is already being organised, and will take place on Saturday 06 July 2019. If you would like to volunteer your time to help organise and run the Fair, please contact [info@stmargaretsfair.org](:mailto:info@stmargaretsfair.org)
