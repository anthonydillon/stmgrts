I'm Alison Anthony of  ETS- Empowerment by teaching your children to swim 10 meters. I  have been teaching children and adult beginners to swim for three years and am STA qualified (the international swimming teachers qualification).

Prior to that I worked in Investment Banking for 30 years. Being a mother I know the frustrations of getting your children into a swimming class and the financial costs.

I'll be teaching a workshop at the beautiful [ETNA Community Centre](https://stmargarets.london/directory/other/201110040733) every Friday  during term time from September:

* From 10 to 11am  - No need to book, just come along! &pound;10 per workshop and 10<sup>th</sup> workshop  is free of charge with the bonus of all the knowledge to get going in the pool.
