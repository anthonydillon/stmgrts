Members voted in favour of a motion on 11<sup>th</sup> September to support the growing campaign for a 'People's Vote' on the future Brexit deal.

At the Full Council meeting, Cllr Richard Pyne, Councillor for North Richmond, proposed a motion that voices the Council's concern over the country leaving the EU and agrees that the British people should have a say on the terms negotiated.

The motion proposed read:

> "The Council is concerned about the damaging effects that Brexit will have on local residents and businesses. It notes poor progress made by Government in planning for withdrawal from the EU and significant risk of a hard Brexit occurring in March 2019.


> "The Council supports the growing campaign People's Vote campaign whereby the British People would vote in a referendum on the terms ultimately negotiated with the EU, including options to rescind Article 50 and for the UK to retain EU membership."


Cllr Pyne, said:

> "Richmond is a Borough that voted heavily (69% - 31%) to remain in the EU. About 12% of our residents are EU citizens and many British residents have close family and business ties with the other 27 EU countries. More and more people are worried about what Brexit will mean for them, their families and the local community.


> "The 2016 referendum failed to address many issues that have subsequently become very important - including the rights of EU citizens living here, NHS and social care staffing issues, and our future trading links with the EU. The People's Vote campaign will allow residents to make an informed choice about our membership of the EU."


Cllr Gareth Roberts, Leader of Richmond Council, added:

> "It is for all these reasons we need to speak out for the people of Richmond upon Thames and demand, for them, and for everybody else in the UK, a People's Vote on the final Brexit deal."
