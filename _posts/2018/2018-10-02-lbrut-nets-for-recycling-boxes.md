Net covers to keep your household recycling secure for collections are now available for sale in all our libraries.

The kerbside recycling nets are elasticated string nets which stretch tightly over the top of your blue and black recycling boxes. This stops contents from spilling out or blowing away.

The net costs &pound;2.10 if purchasing from libraries. Purchasing nets from libraries avoids the related postage costs.

Cllr Martin Elengorn, Cabinet Member for Environment, Planning and Sustainability said:

> "Using a net may increase the amount you can recycle as you will be able to fill your bin without fear of the recycling blowing away."


You can also purchase net covers from our website: [www.richmond.gov.uk/services/waste_and_recycling/buy_net_covers](http://www.richmond.gov.uk/services/waste_and_recycling/buy_net_covers)
