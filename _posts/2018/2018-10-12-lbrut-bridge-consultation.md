The Council is calling for residents to submit their views on a possible new bridge across the River Thames.

Residents have been asking the Council to investigate the possibility of a new pedestrian and cycling bridge over the River Thames. In 2017, the Local Plan, a strategy that sets out planning priorities for development in the borough, made reference to consideration for improving transport links, including a possible bridge.

The Council commissioned a high-level independent study to look at whether or not a bridge would be feasible and is now publishing the findings and inviting the community to express their thoughts on the report and the idea of a bridge.

Should the community think that the idea is worthy of further exploration, the Council will move forward with researching possible funding streams and further feasibility studies.

Any future proposal would be subject to extensive public consultation, dependent on full funding being identified and the Planning process.

Cllr Alexander Ehmann, Richmond Council Cabinet Member for Transport, Streetscene and Air Quality, said:

> "Early on in this new Council administration, it came to my attention that work had been commissioned by the previous Council assessing potential locations for a new pedestrian and cycling bridge across the river Thames."


> "We are absolutely committed to being an open Council. One that aims to work with residents from the early stages of any plans for our community. That is why I am delighted to make this previously undisclosed feasibility study public and ask residents for their feedback and views as part of the Council's first ever 'Call for Evidence' exercise.


> "As the report explains, a new bridge for the borough could provide valuable benefits, linking communities, making it easier for residents to travel around the borough and encouraging more cycling and walking.


> "However, we are at a very early stage in this process.  If residents want us to take a proposed bridge further we would need to identify funding, understand any barriers and work together with residents on bring it into being."
