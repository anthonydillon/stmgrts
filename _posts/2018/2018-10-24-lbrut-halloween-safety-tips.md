Avoid a fright this Halloween night by following simple safety steps to keep your family and your home safe.

Richmond Council is asking parents to speak with their children about staying safe if they are planning to go out on Halloween night and evenings across the holiday week.

Stay safe when trick or treating by following this advice:

* Younger children should always be escorted by an adult
* Only go to houses where residents are happy to welcome 'trick or treaters'
* Don't knock on doors where there is a 'No Trick or Treat' sign - privacy and peace should be respected
* Be visible. Stay in areas that are well lit with street lights - take a torch with you just in case
* Make sure children are aware not to enter anyone's house - stay on the doorstep
* Be careful not to frighten vulnerable people, especially the elderly
* Look carefully before crossing roads
* Advise children not to behave in a disorderly way, for example do not vandalise or throw items like eggs and flour. This can cause damage and misery and it can be classed as criminal damage

And if you are on [Nextdoor](https://nextdoor.co.uk/login/) you can access a Trick-or-Treat map to see which of your neighbours are participating in trick-or-treating this Halloween. You can find the Trick-or-Treat map in the right-hand corner of the website or on the app hit the more icon in the right-hand corner and then the sweet icon titled Treat Map. It's also a great tool to know which neighbours would rather not be disturbed.

Cllr Liz Jaeger, Cabinet Member for Community Safety said:

> "Dressing up and trick-or-treating are highlights of Halloween for many children and their families. But whilst you're having fun, we ask you keep these safety tips in mind to avoid any unwanted frights on the night.


> "Younger children should always be accompanied by an adult whilst older children need to understand how to stay safe and respect the wishes of those residents who are not taking part in Halloween."

And if you hate Halloween, you can [get a poster to tell the children to bugger off](https://stmargarets.london/archives/2009/10/no_halloween_printouts_from_the_police.html)
