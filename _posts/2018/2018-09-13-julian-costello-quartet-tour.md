The Julian Costello Quartet is are touring at the end of this year with support from The Arts Council of England. They aim to do things a little differently to try and expand and widen Jazz audiences and encourage a dialogue.

> I am calling this the Open Soundcheck tour. ... The idea is that the people who are attending one of our gigs come early and sit in on our soundcheck. This means being party to us setting up our instruments, getting a good sound in the room, negotiating a set list as well as some last minute rehearsing. This also means seeing us being a bit stressed and witnessing any pre-gig nerves, and how we handle them. The audience will then be invited to ask any of the band, not just me, questions on err... well...  just about anything really.
