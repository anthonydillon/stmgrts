Working in partnership to create a borough that is safer for all is at the heart of the borough's new Community Safety Strategy, which was approved by Richmond Council last week.

Richmond Community Safety Partnership brings together Richmond Council, the Metropolitan Police, probation services, London Fire Brigade, the Richmond Clinical Commission Group, schools and voluntary groups. All work together to help make the borough a safer place to live, work, learn and visit.

Their new Strategy outlines the priorities for the partnership over the next four years. It focuses on five major themes:

1. *Create safer neighbourhoods* by tackling crime which is of most concern to residents, such as burglary and motor vehicle theft.
2. *Reducing offending and re-offending* amongst adults through early intervention in high risk cases involving drug abuse and domestic violence and creating pathways and safety plans to assist people at risk of offending or re-offending.
3. *Reducing number of young people who are victims of crime or first time offenders*, encourage more victims to come forward, and increase emotional and mental health support for both victims and offenders.
4. *Increasing awareness of violence against women and girls*, and providing early intervention, support and advice for victims of domestic abuse including housing options, and a multi-agency drop-in One Stop Shop service for women experience domestic violence and/or abuse.
5. *Working alongside the Safe Neighbourhood Board, the Inter-Faith Forum*, community organisations and third party organisations, such as Stop Hate UK, to increase reporting and reducing impact of hate crime in the borough.

For the first time, the Community Safety Strategy also includes specific outcomes and actions that will be delivered over the four years. Actions include; improving engagement with Neighbourhood Watch groups to ensure that they play an effective role in keeping their communities safe, enhancing domestic violence provision and creating a crime prevention hub with Richmond police. This hub would aim to reduce crimes that have occurred because of insecure properties, vehicle crime, residential burglary or pedal cycles.

Cllr Mark Boyle, Richmond Council Cabinet Member for Community Safety said:

> "Richmond upon Thames is one of the safest boroughs in the country. By working with our partners in the Police, Fire Brigade, CCG and the wider community we are working hard to reduce crime and anti-social behaviour.

> "However, we know crime and community safety issues are continually evolving and  becoming more complex. This comes at a time when other public sector organisations face continued financial pressures which will require us to work efficiently in partnership, to ensure we can deliver on our priorities.

> "Along with our partners in the sector we will work to tackle community safety issues through neighbourhood policing, addressing complex needs which drive offending and providing additional support to the most vulnerable members of our communities.

> "Being safe and feeling safe is important to local residents. By working together we can make a real difference in our communities."


Rob Applegarth, Superintendent from Richmond Police, added:

> "Richmond upon Thames continues to be one of the safest Boroughs to live and work in London. The Metropolitan Police work closely within the Community Safety Partnership and together we have achieved some outstanding results. This plan demonstrates our firm commitment to prevent and detect crime, to prevent harm and to work in partnership to achieve these aims; I am proud to support its aims."
