*Trumpets sound as historical, local brass band is revived*

A local brass band has been revived in Richmond upon Thames and historical recordings published, thanks to funding from Richmond Council.

The Richmond Brass Band was disbanded in 1983 after 50 years. Last year a community group reformed to relaunch the band in Twickenham, with their first performance being part of the British Legion Remembrance day service.

Thanks to &pound;5,000 from Richmond Council's Civic Pride Scheme, the group will now digitise historical material relating the band, making it available online.  This will include, sound recordings, images and recollections from former band members, providing not only a history of the band but a social commentary on the borough over time.

Since the band was revived, a new website has been launched and they have now attracted over 50 members, both permanent and project-based.

The Council's Civic Pride Fund is available to individuals or groups who want to organise a project or event to improve their local area and deliver more for their local communities. Grants of up to &pound;5k are available to organisations and &pound;1k for individuals.

Cllr David Linnette, Richmond Council Cabinet Member for Voluntary Services, said:

> "Music is part of the history of our borough. Not only have world famous musicians lived, performed and recorded here, but also the involvement of local people means that music is in our blood!


> "I am thrilled that this funding has been used to revive this popular brass band and I look forward to hearing them perform at community events and activities in the future."


Paul van Uden, from Richmond Brass Band, added:

> "Brass bands are a unique and wonderful part of our history, both in the country and in the Borough. It has been so encouraging to see the community come together to make music but getting something like this off the ground is not easy! For us, it has been enabled through the support of the Richmond Council and the Civic Pride Fund.


> "In our first 3 months, we were able to support Remembrance Sunday, send ensembles carolling and also perform in the beautiful Clarendon Hall, raising money for the Mayor's Charities. We are looking forward to a busy 2018 full of brass in the Borough."
