Orleans Primary School has vacancies for two Governors. Governors are vital to the running of the school and it is exciting being involved in new developments and helping the school improve and meet its targets.

Orleans recently transitioned into a two form primary school and is currently rated "Outstanding" by Ofsted; the school is striving to maintain these high standards and continue to improve. Governors need to have the time to commit to full governors meetings, committee meetings and other tasks, at least some of which take place during school hours.

All interested individuals are encouraged to apply, but the following skills and areas of experience are of particular interest:

* Accountancy
* Financial planning and management
* Human resources
