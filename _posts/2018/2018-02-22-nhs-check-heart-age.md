Residents in Richmond are being encouraged to check their heart age and make changes to their lifestyle to keep their hearts healthy.

Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the borough, accounting for 10.8 per cent of deaths in Richmond upon Thames in 2016.

Cllr David Marlow, Cabinet Member for Adult Services and Health said:

"Whilst heart disease is a leading cause of death in Richmond upon Thames you'll be surprised at how small changes to your lifestyle can lead to big improvements in your overall heart health.

"We're encouraging our residents to stay active, eat well, quit smoking and limit their consumption of alcohol. You can check your heart age on the Public Health England page and get information about how to improve your heart health if your heart age high is higher than your actual age. Check your heart age now.

"Residents should also take advantage of the NHS health check service. If you are aged 40-74, live in Richmond, or are registered with a Richmond GP you could be eligible for a free NHS Health Check.

If you do not have diabetes, kidney disease or heart disease, and haven't had a stroke, and haven't had a NHS health check in the last five years, you can get assessed for a range of common conditions and get advice on how to avoid them."

Ask your GP for details, or visit selected pharmacies in the borough. [Find out more]([www.richmond.gov.uk/services/wellbeing_and_lifestyle/nhs_health_checks](https://www.richmond.gov.uk/services/wellbeing_and_lifestyle/nhs_health_checks)).
