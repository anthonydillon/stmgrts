Fancy a challenge this Autumn? Why not take part in a curious challenge at Orleans House Gallery and take a guess at the purpose and history of some mystifying unidentified objects.

As part of the 'Collection Curiosities' exhibition, now open until 25 November, a display of over seventy strange, fascinating and sometimes surreal works are taking centre stage as the public will be shown some of the more curious collections from Orleans House Gallery's storeroom.

Almost all of the works on show have been hidden away from public view in the past because it's never been possible to include them in a particular exhibition. But now with the 'Collection Curiosities' exhibition, you will be able to see strange portraits of the dead and phantoms, images of long-demolished buildings and vanished gardens, atmospheric watercolours, amusing caricatures, macabre objects and much, much more.

With some of the work continuing to mystify, we're giving you the opportunity to fill out luggage tags with information about any unknown works or to answer more playful questions posed about some of the exhibits.

Think you can help us settle the debate? Why not take part in the curiosity conversation and upload photos of your luggage tags, visit the Gallery's Facebook page, or check out the Gallery (@orleanshg) and the Council (@lbrut) on Twitter using the #Orleanscuriosity.

Cllr John Coombs, Cabinet Member for Arts, Culture and Sport said:

> "Our art collection began in 1963. And over the years we have gathered a large number of curious items. We need your help. You can come to our newly redeveloped Gallery to view our vast array of oddities.


> "Uncover those items which have a clear history and view many others that need their past defining.


> "This exhibition is a chance for some of those more curious collectables to get a show of their own - many for the first time. I hope you come along to see just what has been uncovered."


If you can't visit the exhibition in person, you can [explore the entire Collection on the Gallery's new website](https://www.orleanshousegallery.org/collection/).
