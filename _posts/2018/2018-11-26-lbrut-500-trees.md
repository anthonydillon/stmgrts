More trees are set to be planted in Richmond upon Thames this winter as the Council plans to almost double the number of trees planted on last year's figure.

Five hundred trees will be planted across the boroughs highways and parks during this planting season, which runs between the middle of November and the end of March.

The announcement comes during National Tree Week (24 November to 2 December), the Council will be planting both a range of tree species which provide benefits to the local and wider environment.

Cllr Martin Elengorn, Cabinet Member for Environment, Planning and Sustainability said:

> "This year's tree planting season will see an extra 500 trees planted around the borough, almost double the number planted last season.


> "Particular focus will be put on areas where trees have been historically removed and are awaiting replacement, the majority of these trees will be planted during the 2018/19 season and the remainder after any necessary footway repair


> "Varieties of trees have been chosen to suit the areas in which they are planted, and ensure they are able to grow and thrive in varying weather conditions.


> "Each newly planted tree will have a label attached encouraging residents to water them, particularly during hot and dry periods where the extra TLC will supplement the Council's regular watering efforts."
