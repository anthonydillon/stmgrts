Residents across the borough are encouraged to [take part in Transport for London's consultation on its proposed changes to bus routes](https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/buses/bus-changes-richmond).

The changes would affect four routes in the borough.

#### Routes 110 and 419

Routes would be merged and renumbered 110. The new route would go via Whitton, St Margarets and Richmond, and would extend to Hammersmith via Castelnau. However, it would be withdrawn between Whitton and West Middlesex Hospital. The merged route would have buses running every 15 minutes rather than every 20 minutes.

#### Route H37

The frequency would change from:

- Monday to Saturday daytime - From every six minutes to every seven to eight minutes.
- Monday to Saturday evening - From every 10 minutes to every 12 minutes
On Sundays - From every eight minutes to every 10 minutes during shopping hours.

The route will be covered at its busiest point by extended route 110/419.

#### Route 493

This route would be withdrawn between Richmond, Manor Circus Homebase and Richmond Bus Station.

#### Route H22

This route would be rerouted to serve nearer to Twickenham station and no longer go via Richmond, Manor Circus and Twickenham town centre.

Cllr Alexander Ehmann, Cabinet Member for Transport, Streetscene and Air Quality said:

> "The prospect of buses serving parts of the borough that have long-argued for better bus provision is welcome, but this should not be at the expense of frequency or service on other routes.


> "Any reductions in service are particularly disappointing when overall bus usage in Richmond upon Thames is bucking the trend with increasing usage.


> "Reducing the frequency of bus services might seem of lesser impact, but if it makes it more difficult for wheelchair users and parents with buggies to board buses then it runs the risk of disrupting travel and pushing these important users back into more polluting travel options.


> "I would encourage our residents to take part in this consultation and press TfL to deliver the best services it can for our borough.  I know that local people care passionately about our bus services and hope that TfL can improve their proposals."
