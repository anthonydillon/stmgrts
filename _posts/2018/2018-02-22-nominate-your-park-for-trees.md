Residents are being asked to nominate tree locations for planting within the borough's parks and open spaces as part of an initiative to plant more native trees in our green and open spaces.

Residents and Community Groups will be able to suggest locations for where tress should go, as well as what species of trees should be grown with particular emphasis placed on planting native tress which support our native wildlife and contribute to biodiversity.

The initiative comes following a successful application to the Mayor of London's Greener City Fund and planting will taking place during the current season which ends in March.

Cllr Pamela Fleming, Cabinet Member for Environment said:

> "We know the pride our residents have in our iconic parks and green, open spaces. This is a chance for you to have a say in how those spaces evolve, and what they will look like for years to come.


> "Planting more native trees in the borough will be a huge boost for the whole ecosystem, helping our native wildlife and contributing to overall biodiversity. We would like to thank the Green City Fund for its support and I encourage residents to get in touch with their ideas and be a part of how our borough will look for years to come."


If you wish to nominate a location you can do so until the 28<sup>th</sup> February by contacting SWELN [South West London Environment Network] via email: [hello@swlen.org.uk](:mailto:hello@swlen.org.uk)
