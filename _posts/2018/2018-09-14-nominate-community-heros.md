<em>Tell us about the heroes in your community.</em>

Residents can nominate their local heroes as the 2018 Community Heroes' Awards open today.

The Community Heroes' Awards are a chance for us to highlight and celebrate the commitment of the people and groups living and working in Richmond upon Thames, who improve the lives of our communities and represent the borough with pride and excellence.

This is the first-time awards will be offered in specific categories, a sign of the breadth of voluntary work being done in communities across the borough. Winners will be recognised for their heroic achievements in everything from sporting activities and community events to care work.

Cllr Michael Wilson, Cabinet Member for Equality, Communities and the Voluntary Sector said:

> "Our borough is packed with groups and individuals who commit themselves to improving this borough, their community and the lives of people who live and work here. They do that with out expecting anything in return".


> "Now is the chance to recognise this and thank them on behalf the wider community. If there is someone who you know who has gone that extra mile we want to hear their story, so get in touch and nominate them as one of this year's Community Heroes."


Visit [www.richmond.gov.uk/community_heroes](http://www.richmond.gov.uk/community_heroes) to submit your nomination for any category before the 15 October deadline. You can also find hard copies of the nomination form in Civic Centre or your local library.
