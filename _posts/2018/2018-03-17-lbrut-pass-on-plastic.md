    Richmond upon Thames' residents and businesses are being encouraged to pass on using plastics to help preserve the borough's beautiful environment.

    Every year in London we use 2.3 tonnes of plastic packaging, 13 billion plastic bottles, and 2.5 billion coffee cups. Meanwhile, a staggering 1 million plastic straws are used every day. This has to change.

Join us in preserving the environment by passing on plastic

Richmond upon Thames' residents and businesses are being encouraged to pass on using plastics to help preserve the borough's beautiful environment.

Every year in London we use 2.3 tonnes of plastic packaging, 13 billion plastic bottles, and 2.5 billion coffee cups. Meanwhile, a staggering 1 million plastic straws are used every day. This has to change.

Cllr Pamela Fleming, Deputy Leader and Cabinet Member for Environment said:

> "People may not know that it takes 450 years for a plastic bottle to biodegrade and this poses a long term threat to our rivers, oceans and wildlife. Reducing the amount of plastic we use is a huge part of protecting the future of our borough and our beautiful environment.

> "The council has committed to reducing single use plastics whilst local businesses and other organisations have said they'll do the same. Local cafes are already switching to compostable cups and pubs are removing plastic straws.

> "Everyone can play a part by purchasing a reusable cup or mug and reducing the amount of plastics they buy. Together we can make sure that Richmond is the gold standard for reducing single use plastics."

A number of local businesses have already made changes to ensure they are 'passing' on plastic. Find out how these enterprises are playing their part:
