Go with the flow and ditch plastics for parks' water fountains

Drinking fountains in a number of our parks and open spaces are helping people ditch single use plastic water bottles for good.

Nationally, we use 13 billion plastic bottles a year, something that needs to change if our environment is to be preserved for future generations.

Drinking fountains are available to users of Carlisle Park, Kneller Gardens, the Kings Field, North Sheen Recreation Ground, Hatherop Park, Palewell Common and, in the coming months, Vine Road Recreation Ground.

The majority of these fountains have been installed following a grant from the [Drinking Fountain Association](http://www.drinkingfountains.org/).

Cllr Pamela Fleming, Cabinet Member for Environment, Community and Business said:

> "The Council is committed to making Richmond upon Thames the borough to eliminate single use plastics and part of that effort means providing alternatives for people who buy single-use water bottles.


> "We know from our recent Parks Satisfaction Survey that more of our residents are primarily using our parks and open spaces for exercise. We recognise people need to be kept hydrated and hope that by providing more drinking fountains people will bring reusable water bottles rather than single use plastic bottles to our parks.


> "We also encourage sports clubs and sporting events using our parks and towpath to reduce the use of plastics and promote sustainable practices where possible such as the reusable bottles and paper cups.


> "If any of the borough's Friends groups are interested in bringing a water fountain to their local park they can apply for a separate grant from the Drinking Fountain Association and I encourage them to do so."
