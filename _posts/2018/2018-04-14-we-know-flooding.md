    The meteorologists said that last month was the wettest March in over a decade - but we knew that already. Living between two rivers, the Thames and the Crane, we St Margarethians have seen the evidence with our own eyes. Twickenham and Richmond riversides were flooded and so were Radnor Gardens, Ranelagh Drive and towpaths from Teddington to Kew and beyond. Cars bobbed about axle deep in murky waters...

The meteorologists said that last month was the wettest March in over a decade - but we knew that already. Living between two rivers, the Thames and the Crane, we St Margarethians have seen the evidence with our own eyes. Twickenham and Richmond riversides were flooded and so were Radnor Gardens, Ranelagh Drive and towpaths from Teddington to Kew and beyond. Cars bobbed about axle deep in murky waters while hapless owners, seemingly unaware of the flood warning signs on the lampposts above their heads, grumbled  <em>"Why did nobody tell us?"</em> while we mumbled in response, <em>"Why did nobody look?"</em> Then the Crane burst its banks and back gardens along Eve and Haliburton Roads were flooded for six consecutive days We know all about floods...

Sometimes we have our gardens at the bottom of the river."

Perhaps the most dramatic flood took place on the 7<sup>th</sup> January 1928 when melting snows emptying into the Thames, heavy rains and storm surges coming in from the North Sea combined to flood East Twickenham, all the tow paths from Kingston to Kew and submerge Moormead and most of the roads running down to it.

The land upon which St Margarets stands has always been particularly squelchy. J. Middleton's  <em>"1807 Survey of Middlesex"</em> states that some of the most productive market gardens in the area were situated on drained marsh lands by the river side, which, while  <em>"being richly impregnated by water from the river"</em>, were protected from flooding by raised banks of earth known locally as  <em>'sea walls'</em>. Although the seawalls have largely been replaced by more substantial defences some still remain...

Flooding still occurs in and around St Margarets and most of us are sanguine about it. We don't park in places where signs warn us not to. We know how to avoid flooded areas. We try not to worry when the water starts to creep up the garden towards the back door. We remember what Edward Ironside wrote of the Thames in 1796...

> "It is for all uses of life, sufficiently commodious., free from rocks and other incumbrances, from raging currents and swallowing eddies; neither muddy beds, nor unwholesome vapours, but continually bordered with delightful meadows, runneth with still currente into the sea...and justly deserveth all such equal praises as may be said of a sweete, cleare and pleasant river."
