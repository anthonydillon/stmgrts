Richmond Park Football Club will be expanding their girls' football programme with help from Richmond Council.

The Club has been awarded &pound;5,000 to help increase the number of volunteer coaches, particularly women, provide more varied coaching sessions and assist in purchasing new aluminum goals for the new girls' teams.

The expanded programme will give young female football players improved pathways for development including into professional clubs across London. It will also help to meet demand on the club which currently has a waiting list of over twenty players.

The first two girls' teams were established in 2015 and since then a further seven girls' teams have been started with over 100 players now at the club.

Cllr John Coombs, Cabinet Member for Arts, Culture and Sport said:

> "Providing avenues for our young people to participate in sport is not only beneficial to their overall health but fosters great community spirit.


> "It's clear that Richmond Park Football Club has grown from strength to strength in the last three years and I am delighted that the Council has been able to assist the club in taking the next step with their girls' football programme."


David Fox Club Secretary and Girls Football Development Lead at Richmond Park Football Club said:

> "Our club has ambitious plans to continue to improve year on year so that we can offer local girls the best possible opportunity to participate in a fun, safe and development focused environment.


> "We are delighted that the Council has recognised our success and backed our plans. This grant will ensure we can put in place the best facilities, and develop our coaches to their fullest potential to support these plans."
