With summer holidays drawing to a close, those looking to keep fit and active on their return to work are encouraged to take advantage of the Council's Autumn Sports and Fitness Programme.

The programme is packed with courses for both adults and juniors, including badminton, trampolining, netball, gymnastics, martial arts and much more. There will also be a programme of disability sports and activities on offer.

Courses are available at Hampton Sports & Fitness Centre, Pools on the Park, Shene Sports & Fitness Centre, Teddington Pools & Fitness Centre, Teddington Sports Centre, and Whitton Sports & Fitness Centre.

Cllr John Coombs, Cabinet Member for Arts, Culture and Sport said:

> "With summer holidays drawing to an end many of us will be returning to the busyness of day-to-day life. The good news is that doesn't mean you have to ignore fitness and health, with plenty on offer at our sports centres to keep you active throughout autumn.


> "Whether its individual or team sports, no matter your age there's sure to be something you'll find to enjoy."
