Five tonnes of free compost will be given away at the Richmond May Fair on Richmond Green on 12 May 2018.

Environmentally minded residents are advised to get in early as compost is available on a first come first served basis.

Visitors to the May Fair will also be able to receive lots of great advice for reducing textile, electrical, furniture and nappy waste. The team from TRAID will also be on hand to offer a free home textile collection service.

The Council's environmental team will be at the May Fair from 11am to 6pm on Saturday 12<sup>th</sup> May 2018.

Ishbel Murray, Assistant Director for Environment and Community Services said:

> "We are delighted to be able to offer another five tonnes of compost to our environmentally minded residents following on from the hugely successful compost giveaway last month.


> "Come on down to Richmond May Fair this weekend and grab yourself a bag!"


The Senior Contract Manager at Veolia Richmond who will also be attending the event added:

> "To thank Richmond residents for recycling their garden we are donating five tonnes of Pro-Grow; a nutrient rich, peat free soil conditioner that Veolia makes by recycling household garden waste. We hope that many residents will join us at the May Fair and enjoy the benefits of ProGrow."


The giveaway is a great way to round out International Compost Awareness Week which runs from the 6<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> May.
