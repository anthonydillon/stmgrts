All households in Richmond upon Thames have been sent a form asking them to check that the information held on the electoral register about those living at that address is correct.

This is part of the Council's annual voter registration canvass and aims to make sure the electoral register is as up-to-date and accurate as possible.

It will also ensure that anyone who has only recently moved to the borough, or only recently reached voting age can be included on the latest register.

Cathy Potter, Head of Electoral Services for Richmond, said:

> "To make sure you are able to have your say at future elections, please look at the form when it arrives and return it as promptly as possible.


> "If you have changed address in the last year, you will need to register at your new address, so please check the form as soon as it arrives.


> "If you're not currently registered, you can also use this form to tell us who you are and we can either send you and 'Invitation To Register' form to complete. Alternatively, you can just go online to register - details of how to register to vote are included with the form."
