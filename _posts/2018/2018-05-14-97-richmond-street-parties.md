Richmond streets set to rock for Royal Wedding.

Richmond's streets are set to rock for the Royal Wedding of Prince Harry to Meghan Markle with 97 streets having applied to host a street party.

To celebrate the royal nuptials the Council has agreed to waive the cost of closing roads on the 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> May and the bank holiday weekend of 26<sup>th</sup>, 27<sup>th</sup> and 28<sup>th</sup> May.  This includes the cost of the statutory adverts required to make drivers aware. Neighbours and resident groups will only have to fund the cost of hiring 'road closed' signage.

Cllr Gareth, Leader Designate of Richmond Council said:

> "It's fantastic to see so many of our communities getting into the spirit of the royal wedding by organising a street party. To mark the celebrations the Council will be waiving the costs of road closures on these weekends and we are delighted residents have taken advantage of this.


> "No doubt the last two weekends of May will be a festival of colour with much of the borough decked out in bunting and flags, with so many streets coming together to celebrate Prince Harry's wedding!"
