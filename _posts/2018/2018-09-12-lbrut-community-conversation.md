Residents are invited to start their 'Community Conversation' this autumn, at a forum which encourages people to have a real say over issues that impact them.

The Council is developing a new programme of community engagement. One where residents are given the opportunity to have a meaningful dialogue with the Council. As part of this, we have committed to hosting regular meetings in each area across the borough.

The 'Community Conversation' is a transition programme launching in October. It is a series of events, hosted by local ward councillors. Residents can have their say about local issues that matter to them.

Ward councillors will then work with the Cabinet and Council officers to resolve any issues and feedback to residents and the community regularly.

Cllr Michael Wilson, Richmond Council Cabinet Member for Equality, Communities and the Voluntary Sector, said:

> "We strive for an 'open town hall' approach. We don't want decisions to be made behind closed doors. We want to be open as we strive to make this borough the greenest, safest and fairest in London.


> "To achieve this, we must work in partnership with residents. And, we know that on a day-to-day basis it is the ward councillors who are out on the door step, listening and engaging with residents.


> "The Community Conversation is about starting to improve the dialogue between residents and the Council via ward councillors. It is also part of a wider programme of reforms that will see the Council become more democratic, accountable and responsive to the needs of residents especially those who are often unheard.


> "After these initial transition meetings, we will review the programme, inviting feedback from all those who attended. And, they will form the basis of a new approach to wider and more fulfilling community engagement this Council is committed to delivering."
