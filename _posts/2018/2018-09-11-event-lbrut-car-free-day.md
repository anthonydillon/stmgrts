If you missed out on applying to make your street a Play Street for Car Free Day (22<sup>nd</sup> September), the Council is encouraging you to join in the festival of activities happening in Whittaker Avenue, Richmond and Crown Road, St Margarets.

The two roads will be hosting stalls, a bouncy castle and cycling activities including Dr Bike and a free led ride. Street entertainers will also be raising awareness of the benefits of active travel - all funded by the Council!

You will also be able to chat to stallholders about our bikeshare scheme, the healthy walks programme or just have a go on one of our smoothie bikes.

Cllr Alexander Ehmann, Cabinet Member for Transport, Streetscene and Air Quality said:

> "The 22<sup>nd</sup> September will see many of our streets filled with the sound of children playing rather than the hum of car engines as communities gear up to take part in Play Streets.


> "The Council will also be hosting their own Play Streets festivities in Whittaker Avenue and Crown Road with entertainment, games and fun for the whole family. We will also have helpful information available on how you can make your travel more environmentally friendly.


> "So, if you missed out on applying to turn your street into a Play Street I hope you will join us at one in either Whittaker Avenue or Crown Road!"
