Official planning guidance for Twickenham and Strawberry Hill has now been launched, following consultation with residents and business.

Over the past four years the Council has refreshed the Village Plans across the borough alongside the development of locally specific planning guidance on character and design, called Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs).

Last year people in Twickenham and Strawberry Hill were asked what they liked about where they live and work, what could be improved and what they would like to see maintained and enhanced.   The information gathered through community walkabouts around each village, drop-in sessions, Question Time events and online surveys has been used to refresh the Village Plans and develop the SPDs for Twickenham and Strawberry Hill. This was followed by a statutory consultation on the final drafts of the documents including updating the Vision for each area.

The SPDs provide locally specific planning guidance that residents and developers should take into account when preparing proposals or making planning applications in those areas. It will form part of the suite of planning policy documents that the Council will take into account when determining planning applications.

Cllr Pamela Fleming, Richmond Council Cabinet Member for Environment, said:

> "We know from residents in Twickenham and Strawberry Hill that they are very passionate about maintaining and enhancing their local area. Through the Village Planning process, we have worked closely with them to develop the plans, so they can be used by residents, business and developers to cement the style, mood and key features of a particular area.

> "Residents know their local area better than anyone. The Village Plans together with the Supplementary Planning Documents reflect the character, heritage assets and features that have been identified as important, along with priorities for improving their villages.

> "The process does not stop here. We now have to implement and make sure that they are placed at the heart of all decisions in these villages."
