Come along to the Age UK Richmond scams talk with the local police in Twickenham

According to Action Fraud, Richmond upon Thames has one of the highest levels of scams among older people of any London borough. The Age UK Richmond Scam Prevention and Support Service was set up to help older people recognise scams, report them and most importantly avoid them.

We are holding a free Scam Prevention and Support Talk at our Twickenham Wellbeing Centre on the 25th April 2018 from 12:00 – 2:30 p.m. This will include a presentation from the local police, and Age UK Richmond advisors will be on hand to answer any questions you may have.

We will also be providing a free lunch and hot drinks as part of the session.  Booking is essential.
