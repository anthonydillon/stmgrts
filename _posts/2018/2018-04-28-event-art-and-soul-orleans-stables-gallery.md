A special exhibition of art by members of a children and young people mental health programme is being held at the Stables Gallery.

The 'Kaleidoscope' exhibition is being run by Art & Soul until 1<sup>st</sup> July 2018. It features work by members of Art & Soul and is a celebration and look back at its considerable contribution within the borough.

Art & Soul runs weekly arts and wellbeing workshops for adults and young people with mental wellbeing challenges; outreach workshops with local NHS mental health centres, hospitals and residences; pop-up art exhibitions, and a biennial exhibition of member artwork

David Allister, Head of Culture said:

> "Art & Soul have been providing a service to our community for two decades now. They continue to help vulnerable people improve their emotional and mental wellbeing through creative activity and art.


> "This exhibition is another fantastic example of the talent this borough has to offer and I hope you go along to Stables Gallery to view it."


Rachel Tranter, Art & Soul's co-chair said:

> "Kaleidoscope' is a show of over 100 artworks presented by Art & Soul.  The exhibition marks a remarkable achievement in our organisation's history.  For 20 years we have supported community wellbeing through the arts in West London, and last year we took on a new status as a charity.


> "The exhibition includes 2D and 3D artworks by our members, who use art to manage their mental and emotional wellbeing.'


> "The contributions have been numerous, the ethos of Art & Soul is very much about collaboration and working with the community. In keeping with this, we will be holding a family event on Sunday 20<sup>th</sup> May, between 2pm and 5pm. All are welcome."
