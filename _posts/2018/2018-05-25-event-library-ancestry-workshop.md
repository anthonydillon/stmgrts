Unlock the secrets in your family tree this London History Day (May 31<sup>st</sup>) with a free workshop at Richmond Libraries.

The 'Family History for Beginners' workshop will run from 2.30pm to 3.30pm in the Local Studies Search Room, Old Town Hall, Whittaker Avenue, Richmond TW9 1TP.

Using an example of the real-life Etherington family, who lived in Richmond for over 200 years, our Local Studies Manager will guide you through the resources available in the borough's collection to research your family history.

Find out how to follow clues to discover information in unexpected places and learn how pieces of the jigsaw can fit together to build up a picture of a family's lives.

Cllr John Coombs, Cabinet Member for Arts, Culture and Sport said:

> "This is a great way for our libraries to be marking London History Day. After all it's the people who make a city what it is and this is a great way to find out how your own families lived, worked and contributed to this borough and beyond over the years. I do hope that if you are interested you will come along!"
