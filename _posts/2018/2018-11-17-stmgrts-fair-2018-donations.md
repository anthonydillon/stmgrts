    The St Margarets Fair is always an annual highlight for the local community. There was a great line-up of music and entertainment, stalls run by local businesses and organisations, the dog show, a breath-taking display by the Castellers of London and Barcelona, and even a big screen for those who wanted to watch England play Sweden in the World Cup.

*St Margarets Fair - supporting local schools and charities*

The St Margarets Fair is always an annual highlight for the local community. There was a great line-up of music and entertainment, stalls run by local businesses and organisations, the dog show, a breath-taking display by the Castellers of London and Barcelona, and even a big screen for those who wanted to watch England play Sweden in the World Cup.

The Fair donates the profits to worthwhile causes, with donations being divided between local schools and charities. Every year the Fair receives applications for funding from many community-based causes and organisations. This year support has been awarded to The [ETNA Centre](https://etnacentre.org/), [Off The Record Twickenham](https://otrtwickenham.com/) and  [Marble Hill Playcentres](http://marblehillplaycentres.com/).

There are five local schools which provide volunteers and help make the Fair such a success, these are Orleans Primary School, St Stephen's C of E Primary School, St Mary's C of E Primary School , Orleans Park School and Deer Park School.

The Fair also helps fund an Annual Christmas Dinner for around 70 local senior citizens. Over many years the St Margarets Fair has supported a wide range of local charities and preparations are already underway for next year's event.
