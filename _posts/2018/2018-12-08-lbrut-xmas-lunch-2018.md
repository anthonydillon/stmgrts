Older residents who might be alone this Christmas can apply to attend a Christmas Eve lunch, hosted by the Mayor of Richmond upon Thames.

Sponsored by Radfield Home Care, the lunch, on the 24<sup>th</sup> December, is aimed at spreading a little joy to older residents who face the prospect of Christmas alone.

Cllr Ben Khosa, who is hosting the event, is also appealing to local businesses to come forward and donate small gifts to give to the attendees (maximum donation cost &pound;10). For example, chocolates, biscuits, toiletries, books, scarf, socks. Anyone who would like to donate can either drop-off their donation at York House reception, or contact: [mayors.office@richmond.gov.uk](:mailto:mayors.office@richmond.gov.uk)

Please note, spaces at the event are limited and are therefore only available on a first come, first served basis. Tickets cost &pound;7. Preregistration is essential at: [www.richmond.gov.uk/mayors_charities](http://www.richmond.gov.uk/mayors_charities)

Mayor of Richmond upon Thames, Cllr Ben Khosa, said:

> "There are many lonely and isolated people who are facing the prospect of spending Christmas alone. Whilst I can't provide Christmas lunch for all, I hope that the small number of people who can attend leave feeling they've just had a big extended family Christmas. We hope our Christmas dinner guests make friends and connections that can lead into the future.


> "In addition, I hope that residents and businesses help support this event by donating small gifts. Many of these people won't receive anything for Christmas, so even the smallest donation will make a difference."
