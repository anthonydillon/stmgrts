    _Black Labrador Retriever, Lily, went missing from Crane Park / Kneller Gardens area on Christmas Eve._
    
    Her owners think she may have been swept downstream. I know there are many gardens backing onto the River Crane and if she was, she may have been able to scramble out and into a garden, so if you have, or know anyone who has a house backing onto the River or an allotment close to the River Crane, please could you kindly check?

_Black Labrador Retriever, Lily, went missing from Crane Park / Kneller Gardens area on Christmas Eve._

Her owners think she may have been swept downstream. I know there are many gardens backing onto the River Crane and if she was, she may have been able to scramble out and into a garden, so if you have, or know anyone who has a house backing onto the River or an allotment close to the River Crane, please could you kindly check?

The owners are constantly searching and contacting all the rescue centres / vets etc...  The dog is micro chipped and was wearing a red collar with a tag.

There is a substantial cash reward for Lily's safe return.

Please contact 07775860964 or 07775860964 if you have any information.
