_Come and check us out!_

We are looking for enthusiastic volunteers to help us in a number of roles.

Pop into our Missing People East Sheen office during National Volunteers' Week - between 6-8 June and the hours of 9-5pm. We will make you a cup of tea and tell you what we have on offer.




Our address is: Missing People, Roebuck House, 284 Upper Richmond Road West, East Sheen, London SW14 7JE. Our closest train station is Mortlake and there is parking on side roads nearby.

We look forward to meeting you.

Our current volunteers have recently said:

bq. "Whatever your contribution is, you always feel appreciated"

bq. "It is an experience you will cherish far beyond any expectation"

bq. "It's a great, friendly environment and training is first class"

If you can't make it to our office, check out our website for volunteering opportunities - "www.missingpeople.org.uk/volunteer":http://www.missingpeople.org.uk/volunteer
