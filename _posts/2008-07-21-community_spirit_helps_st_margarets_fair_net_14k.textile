bq.. "Visitors got into the "true community feel" of the St Margarets fair as they helped raise over &pound;14,000 for charities and community projects.

The 30th anniversary of the event, in Moor Mead Garden, was celebrated by thousands - many of whom stayed into the evening listening to the variety of bands who performed."
