To commemorate the Centenary of the First World War, a series of borough-wide events will be launched by Richmond Council throughout the year to mark the anniversary.

The brochure 'Commemorating the first World War in Richmond upon Thames' has been launched by Richmond Council to give an overview of the activities taking place between July to December 2014. It provides details of 9 exhibitions, and 42 events including commemorations, community events and learning programmes as well as key highlights for future years.


Richmond Council Cabinet Member for Culture, Cllr Bond, said:

bq. "2014 marks 100 years since the outbreak of the First World War. Richmond's First World War heritage is diverse and unique which is why we are holding a series of events and activities throughout the year. I would urge as many residents as possible to find out what's going on and support the programme as much as possible."

A key feature of the commemoration programme has been the partnership work between 41 different community groups and organisations that are represented in the brochure. This has helped provide a rich programme which promises to commemorate, inform and involve residents in the borough's First World War heritage.
