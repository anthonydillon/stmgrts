_Adults - do you play an orchestral instrument?_

We meet a few times a year. This is for grown-ups and for the fun of spending one evening playing through some music. No performances and no regular commitment.

An indicative standard is Grade 5 and above, but we are pretty relaxed. Everybody is welcome - don't worry if you haven't played for ages or have little experience of orchestral playing. Our (honorary) conductor is Daniel Meyer, local professional violinist and conductor. He tries to encourage us musically, but keeps it relaxed and friendly.

We gather from around 8'ish and play for about an hour and a half, with time for a drink and chat after if you wish. There is a modest charge (to cover room and music hire) and you need to bring your instrument and a music stand.

Please let us know if you might be interested and what instrument you play by email to Tim Elliott "tim.elliott@virginmedia.co.uk":mailto:tim.elliott@virginmedia.co.uk
