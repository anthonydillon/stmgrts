If you missed the Boogie Before Bedtime last Friday night at Winchester Hall next door to The Turk's Head, then you missed a treat. Hopefully, this will be a regular event, because let's face it, how often does anyone get the chance to get down and boogie, anyway? And for free?

Hosted by the Police Liaison Group, and supported by the generosity of Twickenham Police and the Rugby Football Union, the great and the good of St Margarets & North Twickenham Ward cast off all restraint and rocked to the best of DJ Martin Peters' tunes. You'd have to go a long way to find that kind of footwork and energy - and that's just the police we're talking about...

The other highlight of the evening - one that will be discussed at supper tables all over the Ward for weeks to come - was the high-octane display of Bhangra dancing put on by several pillars of the community, plus the constabulary and the Council. 

Eat your hearts out, Bollywood - you've nothing to compare!
