Mr Frisby will be sadly missed as our local butcher. As many residents will know he had to retire owing to health problems. His meat was always of the best quality and he was still climbing the stairs to the cold room at the age of 80! Let's hope that whoever takes the Crown Road shop over, it will keep it's unique interior... Is there a butcher in the parish!?
