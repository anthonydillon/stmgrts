For six weeks from 13 September 2010, essential maintenance work will be taking place on taxiways connecting Heathrow's northern runway with the rest of the airfield. During this period, planes will be unable to alternate daytime use of the runways as published; night time alternation will be unaffected. This means that when the airport is on westerly operations during this time, planes will use the southern runway for the majority of arrivals and the northern runway for departures. As a result, people living under the arrivals flight path for the southern runway will not have the usual half-day respite from aircraft noise. This includes St Margarets.

When the airport is on easterly operations, the usual practice will not change: planes will use the southern runway for the majority of departures and the northern runway for arrivals; night time alternation will be unaffected. If residents would like to speak to somebody about the noise impact of these works or have an enquiry regarding aircraft noise they can call the flight evaluation unit on 0800 344 844 or email "noise_complaints@baa.com":mailto:noise_complaints@baa.com.
