Join us at "our annual visit":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/event/event/200705144212 to see behind the scenes at Port of London Authority's Richmond Half Tide Lock, which maintains river levels through Richmond and Twickenham up to Teddington.

At the Draw-off during the month of November, the Port of London Authority carries out maintenance on the Lock and the river reverts to its normal levels, exposing much of the river bed at low tide.

The tour of the Lock, guided by the lock keeper, provides us with an insight into the history that led to its building and a close-up sight of its amazing Victorian mechanisms.

We continue along the foreshore towards Richmond encountering the remarkable archaeology and ecology that is revealed at low-tide.
