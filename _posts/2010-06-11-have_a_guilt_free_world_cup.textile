For the four weeks of the World Cup Forgetmenot Flowers  are offering a Guilt Free World Cup opportunity.

We will deliver a bunch of flowers each of the four weeks of the World Cup to your partners and football widows, to help you stay in the good books.

This way you can assuage your guilt of being glued to the football/going to the pub, for the whole World Cup tournament, and maybe even earn some Brownie points.

For the tiny sum of &pound;50, we will deliver four bunches of flowers to your loved one - one a week throughout the tournament- by way of apology for being football obsessed, or simply to remind them that you love them too.

Simply go on line at "www.forgetmenotflowersdelivery.co.uk":http://www.forgetmenotflowersdelivery.co.uk to see examples of our flowers, and call us on 0845 680 9081
