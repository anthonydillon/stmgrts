The elections are nearly here. We have sent questionnaires to all the candidates for the Twickenham seat and have had posted the *four* that were returned. They are:

-   Liberal Democrats' [Vince Cable](/archives/2015/04/twickenham_candidate_profile_2015_vince_cable.html)
-   UKIP's [Barry Edwards](/archives/2015/04/twickenham_candidate_profile_2015_barry_edwards_uk.html).
-   Green's [Tanya Williams](/archives/2015/04/twickenham_candidate_profile_2015_tanya_williams.html)
-   Labour's [Nick Grant](/archives/2015/04/twickenham_candidate_profile_2015_nick_grant.html)
