Introducing St Margarets Property Partnership, a uniquely personalised and community-driven estate agency, dedicated to offering the highest quality Sales and Lettings service to the residents of St Margarets.

#### Why St Margarets Property Partnership

As a local resident, I have established SMPP in response to the changing trends witnessed in over a decade of estate agency in south-west London. The result is a stripped-back, client-focussed service minus the jargon and aggressive sales targets, giving us room to really listen to our clients and in doing so combine the very best qualities of traditional and internet agents.

#### St Margarets Property Partnership Charitable Trust

At the core of our ethos is the resolution to 'give something back' through our support of local charitable organisations, and we are delighted to re-invest 5% of all profits into local charities and good causes. Recent donations have included a three figure contribution to local personal trainer, Pete Abbott, who ran the London Marathon in aid of the Willow Foundation, a charity offering special days out for seriously ill 16-40 year olds. In 2015 I am also delighted to be supporting the Big Sleep Out on behalf of Trinity Homeless and Slough Homeless Project ([www.wearetrinity.org.uk](http://www.wearetrinity.org.uk)).

If you are considering Selling or Letting your property or would simply like to chat about the service we offer, please do not hesitate to get in touch.
