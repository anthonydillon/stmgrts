*Where you can find your voice!*

Voice Works runs group and solo singing mixed ability voice workshops for adults in the community to support voice development, where we learn a diverse range of songs and styles.

Great for confidence building and general wellbeing with warm and welcoming one hour workshops and guest musician accompanists for special workshops. Taught by St Margarets local, Maria Margiotta, a qualified singer and teacher.

Voice Works are currently running workshops in the Twickenham and Old Isleworth areas, and are about to start a further one in Richmond and are looking for a St Margarets venue.

*Please get in touch if you are interested.*
