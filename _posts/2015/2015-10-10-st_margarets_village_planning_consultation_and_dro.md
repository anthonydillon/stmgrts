[Drop in session at Twickenham Film Studios - 10am to 4pm on 11 October 2015](/event/event/200705145247)

Following three Question Time events, in the January 2015, a series of drop-ins and walkabout sessions were held in these three villages, to collate information from residents about their local area, particularly key areas of interest, particular features and what residents would like to see improved.

All the information gathered through the consultation, has now been incorporated into draft Supplementary Planning Documents (SPD). These documents contain the vision for the area and planning guidance that the Council, residents, and other land owners should take into account when considering development proposals or making planning applications in these three areas.

You are now invited to [review the draft SPDs](https://consultation.richmond.gov.uk/consultation/stmargarets-spd/supporting_documents/St%20Margarets%20SPD_Oct%2015.pdf) and give your views before they are formally adopted early next year.

A consultation has [been opened online](https://consultation.richmond.gov.uk/consultation/stmargarets-spd/consult_view). In addition, drop in sessions will give residents an opportunity to view and discuss the documents with Council officers.
