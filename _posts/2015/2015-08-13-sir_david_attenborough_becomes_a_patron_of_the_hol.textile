The Trustees of the Holly Lodge Centre in Richmond Park are extremely pleased to announce that Sir David Attenborough has agreed to become a patron of the Centre.

Sir David joined groups of students from two local schools in opening the Centre's revitalized nature trail in June of this year and expressed his enthusiasm for the work of the Centre. "Richmond Park is my favourite place and here in the middle of it is this wonderful Holly Lodge education centre and its nature trail. Schoolchildren can get a real hands-on experience of nature,   with some remarkable facilities for those with special educational needs. We all talk about the 'nature deficit' of many children; here is a practical way to combat that."






In a tranquil setting, the Holly Lodge Centre offers visitors close encounters with the diverse wildlife and distinct heritage of Richmond Park. The nature trail features a hibernaculum or bug hotel, a raised dipping pond for wheelchair users, reptile panels to attract frogs, lizard and grass snakes and other creative facilities to teach children about the natural heritage of Richmond Park.  The Centre's Victorian classroom and Victorian garden, plus the reconstructed 19<sup>th</sup> century pharmacy, offer groups of students the chance to experience how our Victorian ancestors lived, worked and were educated.  All areas are adapted for use by visitors with special needs and groups of all abilities are welcome.
