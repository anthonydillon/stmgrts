Edmund Hilary and Sherpa <em>'Tiger'</em> Tensing conquer the world's highest peak. Under the banner <em>'Be Proud of Britain on this day'</em>, the headline announces - "All this - and Everest Too!" In between drawings of the Queen's <em>'dream dress'</em>, and a map showing the Coronation route, there is a report on Page 5 of a police investigation into the murder yesterday of 16 year old Barbara Songhurst from Teddington whose body was found in the Thames by Eel Pie Island.

#### Saturday June 6<sup>th</sup> - Coronation Day plus 4

Police find <em>'Barbara and Christine'</em> murder weapon on the towpath at Teddington -a sharpened 10 inch file. If the body of Christine Reed is not found today the river is to be drained from Eel Pie Island down to Richmond Lock. Korean War peace talks are delayed once again...

### ...And there the <Em>'Daily Express'</Em> Coronation Souvenir ended

-   The Thames was eventually drained on Saturday 6<sup>th</sup> June and Christine Reed's body found. Like her friend Barbara Songhurst she had been raped, beaten and stabbed. The murderer was Alfred Charles Whiteway who lived in Teddington. He was arrested a month later after two further attacks on women on Oxshott Heath in Surrey. What police officers did not know at the time of Whiteway's arrest was he had been carrying an axe which he had managed to hide under a seat in the patrol car. It was found some time later by a police officer who did not realise its significance. He took it home and used it to chop wood. Forensic tests on the blood found on the axe and on Whiteway's shoes linked him to the murder. When finally shown the axe Whiteway broke down and confessed to the killings, He was hung at Wandsworth Prison on December 22<sup>nd</sup> 1953.
-   The war between North and South Korea ended on 27 July 1953, when the armistice was finally signed and a demilitarised zone established between the two countries.
-   Princess Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor, the eldest daughter of King George 6<sup>th</sup> was crowned as Queen Elizabeth 2<sup>nd</sup> on 2<sup>nd</sup> June 1953. She remains our Queen until this day.
