    Hounslow Council plans to close Church Street, which runs through Old Isleworth to Syon House along the Thames, on 7 December 2015 as a "temporary trial" of 18 months to see if road users change their "travelling habits". But how can the parents and children of the five schools on these roads together with hospital staff and patients "change their traveling habits"? Local residents will still need to get about and people will still want to visit and use the amenities of Syon Park.

Hounslow Council plans to close Church Street, which runs through Old Isleworth to Syon House along the Thames, on 7 December 2015 as a "temporary trial" of 18 months to see if road users change their "travelling habits". But how can the parents and children of the five schools on these roads together with hospital staff and patients "change their traveling habits"? Local residents will still need to get about and people will still want to visit and use the amenities of Syon Park.

Hounslow Council has said that it will not stop the "trial" once they have started it but confirm that the closure will cause significant disruption.

If this affects you, there is "a petition to stop the trial":https://you.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/don-t-close-church-street-1
