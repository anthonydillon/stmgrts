As part of our commitment to continually improve our parks and open spaces, London Borough of Richmond Upon Thames Parks Department are proposing a complete redesign of Champion's Wharf (excluding play beach) on Twickenham Riverside. The redesign follows on from the creation of the hugely popular play beach opened in 2013. The intention of the redesign is to create an attractive space connecting the Embankment with York House Gardens, offering a variety of elements including 10 new trees, perennial planting, granite paving creating a boardwalk with attractive seating overlooking the River Thames and Eel Pie Island.
