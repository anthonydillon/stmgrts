    The St Margarets Traders Association is proud to announce that Crown Road will be closed to traffic for the day so we can bring you live music all day in the St Margarets Tavern's car park, a petting zoo, fairground rides and attractions, street entertainers, a wonderfully varied street market including our delicious summery Pimms stall, pony rides down Bridle Lane, a mayoral visit and much more!
