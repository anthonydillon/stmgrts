The Contemporary Textiles Fair at the Landmark Arts Centre, the Teddington based arts charity, brings together more than 76 individual designer makers offering a dazzling range of contemporary textiles and, to celebrate our 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary, this year a chance to meet and work with renowned textile artist, Sophie Long.

A new feature of the show will be an amazing opportunity for visitors to take a Make & Take embroidery taster class with Sophie Long. Sophie graduated from the Royal School of Needlework in 2008 and in 2011 she was invited to join the team to work on Kate Middleton's wedding dress. Her book 'Mastering the Art of Embroidery' was published in 2013.

The Contemporary Textiles Fair is an established must-visit event in the textile lovers' calendar, offering a wonderful opportunity to see a diverse range of designer makers showing a stunning array of distinctive and colourful textiles. Richly embellished embroidery, hand-stitched wire jewellery, vibrant silks, recycled and re-claimed fabrics re-modelled into fashion accessories, sumptuous hand knitwear and handwoven scarves, wonderful handbags and intriguing 3D wall hangings - the range of work on show is delectable and diverse. Wearable and hangable art from the whimsical to couture.

This is a unique chance to see and buy directly from some of the finest textile artists from all over the UK in the superb gothic surroundings of the Landmark.
