    The Environment Trust's annual Art Auction is on Thursday 26<sup>th</sup> November at York House, Twickenham and always an enjoyable evening.  As a charity, we rely greatly on the proceeds of our Art Auction, which is our biggest fundraising event.  This year the theme is 'Time Off' and we are raising funds for two specific projects: The Story of our Streets (which encourages children and young people to understand more about the history of their local area) and our Active Environment programme which supports adults with disabilities to discover local places of interest.
