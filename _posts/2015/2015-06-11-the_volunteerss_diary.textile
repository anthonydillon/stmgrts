Influx of new children means we have to restructure the 'sixes' - the small units in which the Cubs operate.  Will 'X' get on with 'Y'? Multiply problem by 30.

This new digital system takes about an hour and requires sitting down with the applicant at a computer. Multiply problem by 30.

5.45pm Cub Night. Arrive at St Stephen's School Hall and prepare for arrival of Cubs at 6.00pm. Cubs back from half term and very lively.  At 'Grand Howl' we salute the Union Flag and the Cubs promise to 'Do Their Best'. Organise the new 'sixes' and await grumbling. 'X' doesn't want to be with 'Y'.  Rethink the revised structure. Walk in crocodile down to Moor Mead Park and play "Jail Break". Very noisy. Return to St. Stephen's Hall for drinks and toilet. Cubs settle down to make pinwheels. Peace, perfect peace. 7.30pm Cubs go home. Chat to 'newbie' parents about the forthcoming camp

5.00pm Return to Golden Hinde and change into ships uniform as worn at time of Sir Francis Drake's circumnavigation of the world - 1580. Meet crew - Master, Barber-Surgeon and Cabin Boys. Spend evening learning how to amputate limbs and load cannon. Cubs appreciate the advice from Barber-Surgeon that urine is a universal miracle - useful in treating skin eruptions, diagnosing stomach complaints and cooling down red hot cannon in battle. Sleep on the gun deck beneath the cannons. Verv quiet night.

When Cubs go to the toilet in 'The Crystal' an Austrian family tells us that in their country a 'wee-wee' is called a 'lu-lu'. Cubs very amused. Count them again. Travel by DLR to Tower Gateway. Cubs wonder why there is no driver or guard on the DLR. Tower Gateway Station closed. Grrrr! Count Cubs again.  Catch bus to Waterloo Station and then train to Richmond and waiting parents. Arrive home at 3.30pm, tired but happy, fart finders all!
