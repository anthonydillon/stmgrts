Is that old Rembrandt still cluttering up the attic? Getting bored with those dusty Fabergé eggs in the bathroom? Is that authentic Ormolu clock really tick-tocking you off? Get rid of them NOW in the Annual North St Margarets Residents Association 'Grand Annual Street Sale', which takes place on Saturday 5<sup>th</sup> September from 12.00 - 3.00pm.

The procedure is simplicity itself. On the day of the sale the residents of the NSMRA community - plus anyone else who has things to sell - put tables outside in the street, cover them with all the things that they no longer need - books, records, toys, clothes and so on - and then sell them. They determine the price and they keep the money. The range of goods is huge, from furniture and clothes through to plants, homemade cakes, pickles and jams, assorted rarities, bric-a-brac and DVD's.

As ever GASS Day is open to all comers. If you would like a pitch.simply register with Martyn Day on 020 8892 5211. The cost is £2 for NSMRA residents and £5 for those living outside the immediate neighbourhood.

Adding to the day's sense of community at 11.00 local kids in fancy dress will parade around the area "Beating the Bounds" with magical willow wands. Although the ritual is pre-Christian the children see it as pure "Harry Potter".

For those unhappy souls in "The Village" who rarely venture north to the other side of the A316, NSMRA represents the good folk living in Northcote, Haliburton, Newry, Talbot, Heron and St Margarets Roads. To find GASS, stroll up the St Margarets Road, the A3004, towards old Isleworth and turn left just past the Ailsa pub. You have nothing to lose but your small change!
