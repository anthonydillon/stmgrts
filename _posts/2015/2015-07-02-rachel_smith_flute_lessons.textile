_From beginners to advanced, &pound;20 for half and hour or &pound;40 per hour._

I have around 15 years of extensive teaching experience of all ages from 8 to 80! and beginners to advanced and post conservatoire level, both privately and in schools, as well as coaching youth orchestras and giving masterclasses and workshops across the world.

I also teach theory of music and incorporate aural and sight-reading skills into my lessons to prepare students for graded exams.
