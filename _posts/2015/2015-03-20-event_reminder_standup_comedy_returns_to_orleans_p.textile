Thanks to school parent Lucy Timms, an organiser of the Funny Women standup comedy awards, the evening features an unusually strong lineup of comedy talent.



One of the featured acts also lives in the area. While standups are more usually found in found in Hoxton or Bethnal Green, comp&#232;re Suzy Bennett currently resides in genteel St Margarets, Twickenham. She says:

bq. "When I was invited to comp&#232;re, I contacted my favourite acts on the comedy circuit right now and they said 'yes' right away. I'm delighted to be presenting this show and the fact that it's in my local area is a bonus."

Suzy has featured on BBC's The One Show and the Cult TV Festival and is a winner of the Funny Women award.

A dynamo of a comic, she "accidentally" reached the finals of Jimmy Carr's Comedy Idol, resulting in Jimmy asking her to support him on his "Gag Reflex" tour in 2007.

bq. "Suzy is my support act for a reason. She's a charm bomb that I like to detonate as often as possible."

??Russell Kane??

The show also features Andrew Watts, as seen on FHM's Stand-Up Hero (ITV4) and The World Stands Up (Comedy Central). Andrew was runner-up (to TV's Jack Whitehall) in the Amused Moose Laugh-Off.

An ex-solicitor, his Edinburgh show, "I wish I could be like Andrew Watts", received rave reviews and he is currently touring with his sellout show "Feminism for Chaps".

bq. "An absolutely superb, hilarious show ... it made me laugh more than anything else I've seen so far this Fringe."

The lineup is completed by Debra Jane Appleby, as seen BBC's 28 Acts in 28 Minutes and Paramount Comedy's The World Stands Up, and heard on Radio 5 Live and Radio 4's Woman's Hour.

Winner of The Leicester Mercury Comedian of the Year and Funny Women Comedy Award in 2005, Debra Jane is fast becoming one of the most popular comedians on the circuit.


bq. "Her brassy style endears her to audiences, and her performance is punchily confident, owing more than a nod to the old-fashioned Northern club circuit."
