_How to perform in Opera_

One day workshop with Bill Bankes-Jones, artistic director of London's Tete a Tete Festival and Helen Astrid, soprano and workshop leader.

Learn how to perform with more style, courage and conviction in this invigorating opera training day.

Fine-tune your stage techniques whilst singing your arias with 100% confidence.
You'll leave inspired, rejuvenated and ready to perform in public.



After our previous opera workshop, one participant said: "I had so much confidence in myself that I waltzed in for that job interview and got it".
