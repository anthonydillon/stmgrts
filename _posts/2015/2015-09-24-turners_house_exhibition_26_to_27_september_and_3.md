It is not surprising that many Friends of [Turner's House](https://stmargarets.london/directory/historic_house/201304111542) are artists. Many, inspired by the great landscape artist, have had the thrill of sketching and painting in Sandycombe Lodge, Turner's unique country villa in Twickenham.

They are holding a selling exhibition of their work to benefit Turner's House Trust restoration fund to restore the house to the artist's original design.

The exhibition takes place on Saturday 26<sup>th</sup> and Sunday 27<sup>th</sup> September (11-5pm) and Saturday 3<sup>rd</sup> October (2-4pm). 3<sup>rd</sup> October is the last day Turner's House will be open to visitors prior to closing for restoration through 2016. Entry to the exhibition is free on all days, but for guided tours of the house on 3<sup>rd</sup> October there will be the usual Â£4 entry fee.

The exhibition will include a wide range of mediums and styles, producing figurative to abstract works in painting, drawing, sculpture, textiles, ceramics and printing, which includes etchings and lino productions.
