*Come to our FREE sessions from 17<sup>th</sup> March to 28<sup>th</sup> March*

One of the best known learning programmes in the world want mums and dads to take a moment out of their busy schedules and come and be in the moment, cherishing each minute with their child at sessions led by trained Gymboree teachers.

From a St Patricks Days party to Messy Play Sessions and Daddy Day we are inviting little ones and their carers to play sessions at Gymboree St Margarets in aid of the NSPCC. All the events are open to members and non-members and there are buckets for you to contribute towards this crucial charity.

*Please contact us for more details and to book a place.*
