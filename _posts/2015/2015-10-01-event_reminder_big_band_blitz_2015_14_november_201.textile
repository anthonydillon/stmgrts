The Jon Bennett Big Band (appearances include London's Savoy Hotel,  Australian High Commission, Dominion Theatre, Lyceum Theatre, and the Royal Gala Performance at Richmond Theatre) will play the music of Glenn Miller and other Big Band songs of the period, and will feature special 'showbiz' guests, including the 1940s three girl sensation, My Favourite Things;  the acclaimed new singing sensation from France, Aurora Colson;  actor/singer Jack Pinder ; top big band vocalist Fiona Paige (vocalist with the John Miller Orchestra, nephew of Glenn Miller); legendary vocalist, Peter French (formerly lead vocalist with Atomic Rooster); and Peter Hammerton (formerly with the legendary  band The Others) as George Formby; plus a few surprise guests.

Big Band Blitz was featured on BBC TVs Strictly Come Dancing in 2009 to mark 70 years since the start of the Second World War.  This year, the 16<sup>th</sup> year of Big Band Blitz, the night will commemorate 75 years since the Battle of Britain, and 75 years since VE-Day and VJ-Day.

This charity event will help benefit The Mayor's Charity Appeal (registered charity no. 290585), which this year is the Alzheimer's Society.
