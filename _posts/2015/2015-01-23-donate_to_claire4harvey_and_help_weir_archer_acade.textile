Claire Wood is my son Harvey's former support teacher. She has played a pivotal role in helping him access mainstream education and making school such an enjoyable experience for him. She is running the London Marathon for the Weir Archer Academy. They provide Harvey with access to sports, a racing wheelchair and expert coaching to help him fulfil his dreams.

This is Claire's own words about why she is doing this.

bq.. "I first met Harvey when he joined St Stephen's Primary School when he was eight. I worked as Harvey's Learning Support Assistant and it was an amazing four years. Anyone who knows Harvey knows he is a feisty character who loves sport and who is fiercely competitive.

Harvey will be twelve in February. He suffers from Hurlers Syndrome which is a degenerative condition. He can no longer walk unaided and cannot even stand for long. He needs his wheelchair for mobility. Watching Harvey's ability to participate in sport at school slowly deteriorate and ultimately disappear was both heart-breaking and frustrating.

He then had the opportunity to attend a Weir Archer Academy open day and Harvey's perspective about his disability changed. He had something different, something of his own to do outside of school.  The academy gives Harvey the ability to access different sports and compete - he loves it! The academy provides Harvey with a racing wheelchair and expert coaching. He trains every Friday and Saturday and he is preparing for his first season of racing next year.

I know this marathon is going to be torturous but knowing I'm running for a charity that has changed Harvey's life will get me through!  You can "watch a short video about the wonderful work they do (along with a great little cameo from Harvey)":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIfprSokqRw&feature=youtu.be

p. Each racing wheelchair costs thousands of pounds but the joy that they bring is priceless. Claire has been set a minimum target of raising &pound;2,000 which is the minimum requirement for a charity to gain a place at the London Marathon. We would obviously like to raise much more. Claire, Harvey and I would all be delighted if You would make a donation by sponsoring Claire.
