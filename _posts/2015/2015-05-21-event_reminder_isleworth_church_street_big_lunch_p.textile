* Eileen Sheridan a well-known local resident champion cyclist will officially open the Party at mid-day and the outgoing Major Corinna Smart will join us arriving between 12.30 - 1.00 pm.
* Radio Jackie will be providing its very own Road Show throughout the afternoon, sponsored by The London Apprentice Pub.

There will be something for everyone, young and senior which promises to be a super great "Community Event" for a well deserving cause.

Adding to the excitement of the day will be a mini circus for the children with stilt walking and giant bubbles provided by Bezerka not forgetting a Punch & Judy show.  A silent auction will also run with fabulous prizes to tempt those who wish to win without constantly bellowing out their bids plus a raffle, where the top prize of the day will be a 7 night holiday for two on a Greek Island.

* The local Police, St John's Ambulance and Fire Brigade will also be on site to answer questions from the public.
* The London Apprentice will yet again be supporting it by generously sponsoring two bands to keep you in the musical mood.  For the hungry and thirsty who need to re-charge their batteries there will a variety of food and drinks stalls for them to  buy what they like.
