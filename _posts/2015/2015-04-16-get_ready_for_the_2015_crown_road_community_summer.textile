"Sunday the 7<sup>th</sup> June on Crown Road, 11am - 5pm!":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/event/fair/200705144971

After the success of last year's musical fair, Crown Road will again be closed to traffic so the St Margarets Traders Association can bring you a day of family entertainment!

There'll be live music all day in the St Margarets Tavern's Car Park from an eclectic mix of great bands, a street market with diverse stalls, a petting zoo, rides and attractions, fun and games for all the family!

So put it in your diary and we'll see you there! Watch this space for more information...

If you would like to get involved please email: "pr@mystmargarets.com":mailto:pr@mystmargarets.com.
Limited spaces for stalls are still available but please act quick to avoid disappointment.

Earlier on the same day it's the Turks Head 10k Fun Run, so join in the fun of both events and let's make St Margarets the place to be!
