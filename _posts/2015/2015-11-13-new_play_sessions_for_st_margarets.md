Brilliant Play Solutions CiC is an award winning local social enterprise providing rich play opportunities for children and their families. There are three parent and child preschool play sessions to choose from in St Margarets and East Twickenham all designed to offer children high quality opportunities for play and for their grown us to meet for a cuppa and a chat in a friendly and welcoming environment.

Monday afternoons 1.30-3.30pm and Saturday mornings 10-12pm families can come and play at the ETNA Community centre and Wednesday mornings sees the St Margarets Toddler group meet at the St Margarets Catholic Church. For budding creatives there is a craft table as well as a playdough table for all rolling, squishing and shape making needs complete with beautiful homemade playdough. There is a range of construction toys, dressing up and small world play. Playing outside is important too so there is space for running and riding as well as a mud kitchen to whip up mud pies or petal soup. And if this wasn't enough Marc the Guitar Man ends every session with a fantastic sing-a-long! [Find out more online](http://brilliantplay.co.uk/st-margarets-toddler-group/).

New session for autumn 2015 [Fantastic Fridays Play Cafe.](http://brilliantplay.co.uk/fantastic-fridays-play-cafe/) As the nights start to draw in and the park starts to look unappealing for any length of time Brilliant Play aim to provide a cosy place to meet with friends and relax with a cuppa and treat yourself to a slice of cake. 'Fantastic Fridays' will be the perfect place to play if you have older ones to collect from school too as there will be an art and craft activity, twilight games in the garden as well as tasty treats to buy from the cafe. Think of it as the ultimate Friday play date (but without the mess in your house!) The Play Cafe will run from 2.30-5pm every term time Friday afternoon at the St Margarets Catholic Church hall £3.50 for adults and £1.50 per child.
