Ellen Goldsmith, Physiotherapist at the St Margarets Clinic has entered the "Toughest Footrace on Earth", The Marathon Des Sables, a 250km, self-sufficient run across the Sahara, 3-13 April 2015. She will be alongside 1,500 other competitors, including the "greatest living explorer" Sir Ranulph Fiennes and raising money for the Medecins Sans Frontieres.

The Medecins Sans Frontieres was officially created on 22<sup>nd</sup> December 1971. At the time, 300 volunteers made up the organisation: doctors, nurses and other staff, including the 13 founding doctors and journalists.Â It was created on the belief that all people have the right to medical care regardless of gender, race, religion, creed or political affiliation, and that the needs of these people outweigh respect for national boundaries.
