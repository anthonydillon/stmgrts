    I wanted to tell you about my charity walk I am doing in May. I am walking from Edinburgh to London in May and would love to be featured by you! I am raising money and awareness for a small charity called TWOWEEKS, helping kids in need in South Africa with HIV.

I eat and breathe this walk, it is all I can think about at the moment! I leave on the 23rd of May 2015, I am starting at Edinburgh castle and hope to get to Twickenham about 6 weeks later (July 6th)
