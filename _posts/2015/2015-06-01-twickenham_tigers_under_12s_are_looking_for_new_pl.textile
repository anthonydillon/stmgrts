If you have a boy who will start year 7 Secondary School next year and who you think is capable of playing to a Surrey Youth League championship division standard, we'd love to hear from you!

Twickenham Tigers are a friendly community club which has been together for four years and is well established in the Championship division.

Boys must be available for early Friday evening training in Twickenham and for games on Sunday.

The team finished a respectable 7<sup>th</sup> last season after a slow start - next season we're really keen to push on up!



The boys have been coached to play an extremely attractive short passing style and have been commended by many rival managers.

You are welcome to attend a Friday training session completely free of obligation.

If you would like to know more, you've very welcome to call Bob Howard for an initial chat on 07906 951 542 or email him at "bob.howard@bbc.co.uk":mailto:bob.howard@bbc.co.uk
