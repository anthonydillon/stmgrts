Richmond Shakespeare Society (RSS) - one of the borough's longest-standing theatre companies - is staging The Taming of the Shrew  by William Shakespeare  from "Monday 20<sup>th</sup> to Saturday 25<sup>th</sup> July at the Fountain Gardens, Twickenham Riverside":http://stmargarets.london/event/play/200705145122.

Colour and comedy are about to burst onto the tranquil Thameside setting of Twickenham's idyllic Fountain Gardens. Even the naked ladies have been tempted to crack a smile at the antics of this talented team of RSS players as they romp through Shakespeare's famous battle of the sexes. Set in the rollicking, riotous world of the circus ring, RSS's open air production of this much-loved comedy will be as bawdy and boisterous as a classic 'Carry On'.



Wild, sharp-tongued Kate must marry before Bianca, her younger and far more demure sister, is allowed to wed.  Enter the swaggering, gold-digging Petruchio, as maddeningly strong-willed and perverse as Kate herself.  Together they form one of theatre's great screwball double-acts, a couple hell-bent on frustrating and outwitting each other right up to the play's outrageous, equivocal conclusion.  This duelling duo are surrounded by a gallery of great comic characters who create a vibrant, colourful world of low slapstick, high jinks and even higher stakes.

So bring a generous picnic and sense of humour, a chilled bottle and attitude, and enjoy the thrills and spills of this rip-roaring, rib-tickling roustabout comedy.  Gasp as lion-taming Kate gets a touch of her own treatment.  Laugh as Bianca's amorous admirers attempt evermore desperate ploys to woo her.  Sigh as true love triumphs over the twists and turns of fate and plot to win the obligatory happy ending.  Roll up, grab your ticket... and join the circus!
