<div class="letter">

As you know, the Pavilion on Moormead recreation ground was previously used as a sports facility with changing rooms, serving area, small kitchen and toilets, but is currently in need of full refurbishment.


The Council and the local community has an aspiration to bring the building back into use with a focus around a good quality community facility. The council would like to invite expressions of interest for the regeneration of this facility. We are currently seeking expressions of interest only and there is no commitment on any party to move any proposal forward

The details of how to submit can be found on the councils website at:- "www.richmond.gov.uk":http://www.richmond.gov.uk/home/services/parks_and_open_spaces/latest_parks_information.htm


Notices will also be erected on the pavilion itself in the next 48hrs to notify site users and in the next few days a press release will be issued.

Expressions of interest are to be submitted in writing / email to the Council Offices by noon on 2nd December.

Regards

David Allister
Head of Parks, Document & Delivery
