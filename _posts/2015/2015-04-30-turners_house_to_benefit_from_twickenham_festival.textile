This year's Twickenham Festival has nominated Turner's House Trust as its charity to benefit from this year's event.

The Festival is a great supporter of local charitable organisations and has recognised the sterling progress the Trust has made with its 'Returning Turner to Twickenham' project to restore Sandycombe Lodge, JMW Turner's country villa, and preserve it for the nation.



"It is wonderful to have a national treasure on our doorstep," said Bruce Lyons of Crusader Travel, the force behind this annual Festival. "Attracting new visitors to Twickenham raises awareness of our beautiful town, which can only benefit local traders."

Catherine Parry-Wingfield, Chair of Turner's House Trust welcomed the news. "This is wonderful generosity from the Festival organisers and will help us to fulfil our vision by helping us to raise the last slice of funding needed to bring this beautiful building back to life. "
