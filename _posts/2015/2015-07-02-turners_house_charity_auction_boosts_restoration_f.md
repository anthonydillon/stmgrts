Thanks to the team at High Road Auctions, Twickenham who generously donated their time and talent to host yesterday's auction, and those who donated collectables, Turner's House Trust's restoration appeal fund has benefited by over £3,000.

"We are hugely grateful to manager, David Holmes (and on this occasion auctioneer) and Sara Sturgess at High Road Auctions who spent many hours to ensure the success of our event and for their very warm welcome to all on the day," said Catherine Parry-Wingfield, chair of Turner's House Trust. "And to all our supporters who kindly donated items and those who joined us on the day, thank you so much for contributing to what became a fun, as well as very profitable event. We are also delighted that Shona and Bruce Lyons of Crusader Travel had the inspiration to suggest the auction as part of the Twickenham Festival celebrations."

Donations that included paintings and prints, porcelain, glass, furniture, jewellery, general memorabilia and several generous offers, formed 50 interesting lots, many of which gained considerable interest and competitive bidding.

"We still need nearly £240,000 to reach our total project cost of £2.4 million, required by the end of this year before we can begin restoring Turner's House in Sandycombe Road for the nation. We hope to reach our final target, enabling works to begin early next year," said Catherine.
