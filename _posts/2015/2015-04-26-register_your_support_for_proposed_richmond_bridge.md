Bellevue Place Education Trust has announced that it will be submitting an application to the Department for Education for a primary free school in the St Margarets/East Twickenham area in May.

Claire Delaney, Chair of the Trust said: "We remain committed to opening a much needed primary free school in the area. This application is hoped to make good on our promises to the community when we made our first application.

> "A crucial element of our application to the Department for Education is demonstrating a high level of demand for the school. We will be building on the overwhelming support already received and will be out and about in the local community over the next few weeks sharing our plans for Richmond Bridge School and collecting expressions of interest.Â We particularly need the support of parents with children due to start primary school in September 2016 and 2017."

Bellevue Place Education Trust was established to offer a combination of the best that independent and state education has to offer to parents and pupils from all backgrounds. Richmond Bridge School will be part of the wider Bellevue Place Education Trust family of schools and will be the sister school to Deer Park School which is set to open this autumn near its permanent site in Lower Mortlake Road,
