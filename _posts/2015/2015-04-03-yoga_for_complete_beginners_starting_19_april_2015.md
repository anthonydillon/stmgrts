In our hectic modern world many people are taking 'time out' to practice yoga - a system that originated in India 5,000 years ago. Everyone can practice yoga, regardless of age, sex or ability.

Yoga offers us a holistic approach to body and mind, which can provide us with the 'tools' to cope with the challenges of daily life. Yoga can also complement medical science and therapy for specific conditions.

You may be drawn to yoga simply for health and fitness, or be seeking relief for a specific physical condition. You might want help with managing stress. Whatever your objectives, there are yoga classes that can meet them.

Many people interested in trying out yoga may be intimidated by the thought of exotic bends and legs wrapped behind heads. Walking into an established yoga class, especially when you have never practiced yoga before, can be really daunting, and this is why Yoga-Fitness has developed the 'Complete Beginners' Yoga Course. Only for the complete and utter beginner, or those who have practised a long time ago and want to re-visit the basics.

This five week course will introduce you into the world of yoga via the key yoga poses (asana), basic breathing (pranayama), and relaxation techniques, all in a safe and friendly environment. The physical postures will help to improve tone, strength, flexibility and balance, whilst the breathing and relaxation techniques will help you to rejuvenate and relax.

You won't come out a fully enlightened yogi by the end of the course, and expect to be doing this...

BUT you will certainly know your way around a downward dog, know how to breathe using the full capacity of the lungs, and have a confidence you didn't have before. Hopefully feeling more like this...

The next 'Complete Beginners' Yoga Course starts on April 19<sup>th</sup>. See below for the details:
