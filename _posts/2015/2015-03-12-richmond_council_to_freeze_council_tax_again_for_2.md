Richmond Council's Deputy Leader and Cabinet Member for Finance, Cllr Geoffrey Samuel, is committed to delivering a sixth successive Council Tax freeze in 2015/16, and zero or low increases in future years.

The Revenue Budget for 2015/16 was agreed by Cabinet on Thursday night and a final decision on the level of Council Tax will be made by Full Council on March 3. The Council's medium term financial strategy aims to deliver a Council Tax freeze whilst protecting existing services. The strategy has been developed in light of the national budget, the impact the Local Government Settlement has had on all local Councils, and with a review of the Council's reserves and balances.

Richmond Council's Deputy Leader and Cabinet Member for Finance, Cllr Geoffrey Samuel, said:

> "Once again our prudent financial management of the Council's affairs mean that we can freeze Council Tax whilst still protecting services. Faced with huge cuts in Government grant we are improving our efficiency - and our residents are the winners."

Whilst so many homes across the country have been squeezed by the recession, Richmond Council has frozen Council Tax for five successive years. This has been made possible thanks to prudent financial control of the Council's budget. Since 2011/12 the Council has achieved over £31m in savings including £15m from restructuring and sharing services, £10m from procurement and contract savings and £6m from income generation and other measures.
