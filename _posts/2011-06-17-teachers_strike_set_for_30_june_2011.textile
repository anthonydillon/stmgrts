bq.. "Two of Britain's biggest teaching unions have voted in favour of a strike over changes to pensions, in the first sign of collective opposition to the coalition's austerity programme.

The ballot in favour of a strike by the National Union of Teachers (NUT) and the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL) is expected to close schools across England and Wales this term, affecting millions of children. The civil service union the PCS publishes the result of its own strike ballot on Wednesday."
