A furniture swap shop allowing residents to donate unwanted home and garden goods and pick up others absolutely free will take place at "Twickenham Stadium on Sunday, 23 September":http://stmgrts.org.uk/event/meeting/200705141686. Local people are invited to give away unwanted furniture, appliances and other items from the home and garden, and take their pick from the free goods on display. You do not have to donate items to take others away.

People are asked to bring unwanted items between 10am and 11.30am on the day. The goods will then go on display and are available on a first-come, first-served basis from 12.30pm to 3.30pm.

Compost bins will be on sale from 12 noon. Entrance to the event for pedestrians will be via Gate F while motorists can enter the car park from Whitton Dene. The last Give and Take Day in East Sheen in April attracted 500 people who found new homes for seven tonnes of furniture and household goods.
