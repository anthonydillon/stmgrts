    _1<sup>st</sup> St Margarets Scout Troop_ needs your help.  We require old china for our Krazy Kitchen stall at the "St Margarets Fair":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/event/fair/200705142755. Horrible mugs, broken teapots, non-matching cracked plates and novelty eggcups all welcome -- no donation too small!  We just need to avoid vitreous china (looks like a cross between glass and china) as it is dangerous when it shatters.
    
    Please either deliver to 133 Haliburton Road TW1 1PE (leave on doorstep or in front garden if no-one in) or if you would like it collected please email "hilary@hilarythomson.co.uk":mailto:hilary@hilarythomson.co.uk
