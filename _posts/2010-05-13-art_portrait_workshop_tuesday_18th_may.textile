We are a small  friendly group who meet on Tuesday evenings to practice our portrait drawing skills.  Why not come along and join us at the Crane Community Centre ("49 - 51 the Meadway Twickenham TW2 6PY":http://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?x=514721&y=173199&z=110&sv=514721,173199&st=4&ar=y&mapp=map.srf&searchp=ids.srf&dn=679&ax=514721&ay=173199&lm=0)?

The cost is &pound;10

The Crane Community Centre is right next to Trafalgar School in The Meadway and you would need to drive through the metal gates of Trafalgar shool, park and you will see a large wooden chalet style hut to the left- which is the Crane Community centre.

There are tables - no easels.  We are mostly using pencil and charcoal,  you can paint but we have to be careful with the carpet. We have a clothed model who poses for us.
