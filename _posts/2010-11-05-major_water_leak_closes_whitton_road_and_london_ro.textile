A major water leak has force Richmond Council to closed the junction of Whitton and Twickenham Roads this afternoon, 5 November 2010.

An emergency diversion is being put in place using Crown Road.  The Council will have to suspend all pay and display bays in Crown Road between Kings Road and St
Margarets Road.

It is likely that Bus Routes 281 and 267 will both be diverted via Crown Road.

Obviously, the timing is horrible with a major international at Twickenham Stadium tomorrow.
