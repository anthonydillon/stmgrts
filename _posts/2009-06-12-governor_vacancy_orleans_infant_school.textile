The Governing Body of Orleans Infant School currently has a vacancy for a Community Governor.  Governors take a strategic role in guiding and supporting the school's work and encouraging further improvement.  The Governing Body meets twice every school term and governors are expected to attend as many meetings as possible, these meetings are generally held in the evening.  In addition to these meetings most Governors will participate in at least one sub committee (normally held in school hours) and should be available to come into school and participate in general school activities on an infrequent basis.

A school governor does not need to have any background in education or to have children at school.  The main criteria are a willingness to learn and a genuine commitment to giving time to the school.   Training for the role is provided by Richmond Borough. If you might be interested in joining the governors of Orleans Infant School, please contact us at "info@orleans.richmond.sch.uk":mailto:info@orleans.richmond.sch.uk for further details of the role and application process.
