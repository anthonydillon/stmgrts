We are currently recruiting all kinds of creative businesses (at all stages of development, from idea to newly trading) to take part in our year-long part-time course that starts in October 2014. We have no age, location, race or gender preference; we are just looking for brilliant budding creative entrepreneurs with heaps of ambition, dedication and creative super powers!
