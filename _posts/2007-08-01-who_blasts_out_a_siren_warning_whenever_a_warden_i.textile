_Martin Herdman of course._

From an article on "thisislondon.co.uk":http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23406609-details/The%20trader%20who%20blasts%20out%20a%20siren%20warning%20whenever%20a%20warden%20is%20coming/article.do (1 August 2007):

bq.. "When traffic wardens started to blitz a quiet corner of suburban London, one shopkeeper decided it was his duty to fight back.

Martin Herdman put up a 1,000-watt public address system outside his shop in St Margarets, near Twickenham, and recruited a network of "spies" to alert him the instant they spotted a parking attendant in the area.

Then, as soon as the alarm was raised, he started playing a recording of a Second World War-style air raid siren over the system.

Mr Herdman's early warning system gives customers a chance to move their cars before they are ticketed by the warden."
