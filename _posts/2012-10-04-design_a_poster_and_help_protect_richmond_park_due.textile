There's a little over 3 weeks to get your entries in to the Posters in the Park competition.

Organised by local charity the Friends of Richmond Park, the competition is open to anyone of almost any age within three categories.  The aim of the competition is to design a poster that will be used in publicity campaigns to help protect Richmond Park's wonderful wildlife and environment.  The competition is easy to enter; simply use the entry form and follow the instructions at: "www.frp.org.uk/friends/competitions":http://www.frp.org.uk/friends/competition.

Prizes will include the fabulous new hardcover book from local award-winning photographer Alex Saberi.  This is one of his stunning pictures which is also used on the cover of new book, Richmond Park.
