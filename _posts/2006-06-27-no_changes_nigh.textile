The Department for Transport has announced there will be no increase in night flights at Heathrow for the next six years.  It has backed down from its proposal to increase flights numbers at the airport between 11:30pm and 6am.  The number will remain at 16.  Most of these flights arrive between 4:30 and 6am.  There are no scheduled take-offs between these hours, though from time to time BAA will permit aircraft running late to take off after 11:30pm.  The Department, when it made its announcement, said very little about the hour between 6am and 7am.  We can expect to see some increase in flight numbers during this hour.  Although residents are relieved that the Department has backed away from its original proposals, there is still a lot of anger that the Government refuses to bite the bullet and ban night flights at Heathrow altogether.
