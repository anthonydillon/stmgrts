Well, it isn't exactly our year anniversary, but its the end of the calendar year, so we thought we should run our first ever "Reader Poll":/static/info/readerpoll2006.html to see how we are doing.  It would be great if you could spare us ten minutes of your time to help us know what is working and what isn't.

The site has been doing fairly well considering, we have been growing month over month in people looking at the site (see the above chart) to roughly 1,000 people a week now.  However, we know there is a _lot_ more that we could be doing, but we need a lot more help.  So if you want to help with writing, typing, finding events, or helping get the word out, please let us know in the "Reader Poll":/static/info/readerpoll2006.html
