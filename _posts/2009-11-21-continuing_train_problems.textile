    Because of extensive flood damage to a river bridge in the Feltham area, trains are currently unable to run on lines between Hounslow / Whitton and Feltham.
    
    Network Rail engineers are working hard to provide a temporary solution which will allow a limited train service to operate next week. Until this is completed, a revised timetable is in operation on the affected routes. Journey times may be extended by up to 45 minutes.
