The old Koblers' Bakery building has apparently been sold <!-- by Kimberley Foster, who also owns a series of now derelict shops,  including Artefact, Hairpin Bend and Laisy Daisy on St Margarets Road near the Brunnel site,--> to Chase Buchanan, the estate agent who is seeking "planning permission":http://www.ukplanning.com/richmond/showCaseFile.do?councilName=London+Borough+of+Richmond+upon+Thames&appNumber=07/1816/COU to change the building to A2 use for their offices.

According to the application:

bq. "This proposal is in keeping with the spirit and direction of local planning and will protect the retail integrity of St Margarets Road whilst aiding the growth of a successful local business and employer."

St Margarets will now have six shop fronts dedicated to Estate Agents -- 18% of all shops.

If you would like to comment on the application, you may do so "here":http://www.ukplanning.com/richmond/createComment.do;jsessionid=3DAEFAB1054AFD969FF67B2E4EBD537F.wam2?action=CreateApplicationComment&applicationType=PLANNING%20FOLDER&appNumber=07/1816/COU.

UPDATE: apparently the 'derilict' shops are not accurately listed... so I have removed the phrase from the article as I do not have time to investigate the matter personally.

UPDATE: strangely, people are having a hard time reading the links in this particular article... even though I have not changed anything with the look of the site in ages, so:
