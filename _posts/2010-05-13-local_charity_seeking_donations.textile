HANDS - _Help a Neighbour in Distress_ - is a neighbourhood care scheme covering Twickenham and St Margarets.

Our volunteers give practical help and support in many ways to people of any age group in need, especially elderly, frail, disabled, sick and lonely people in our community.

We organise the "Charities Fair on Twickenham Green on the spring bank holiday Monday 31<sup>st</sup> May":http://stmgrts.org.uk/event/fair/200705142442.

84 charities and voluntary organisations are taking part.

We would be most grateful for donations of soft toys for one of our stalls.

Please telephone  0208 891 3346 mornings, or leave a message. We can collect.

We would be most grateful!
