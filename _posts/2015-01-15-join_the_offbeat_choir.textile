_Offbeat is a fun, friendly, non-auditioned and paper-free choir based in Richmond._

We sing a variety of songs from Gospel, World, Jazz - anything that sounds great and is a joy to sing.  Rehearsals are on Thursdays in term-time from 8:15-9:45pm in the side hall of the Vineyard Church.  Our choir leader, Ruth Routledge, is enthusiastic and dynamic, working us hard to get the best out of us, as we do regular performances and practise in between sessions using sound recordings.

We are welcoming new members so contact Ruth to join.
