The _St Margarets' Traders Association_ has applied to the Richmond Council for the right to adopt the Barron's Road recycling site.  The goal is to use the money raised to:

* Help raise awareness about the importance of recycling
* Keep the site clean and tidy
* Use the money to maintain the hanging baskets for 2006 (see our article, "Hanging Baskets Coming Soon":http://stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2005/04/hanging_baskets.html)
