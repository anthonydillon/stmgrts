Alce was born in Sussex in 1966 into an artistic family, surrounded by photographers, art teachers, architects and printmakers, so it came as no surprise when she embarked on an artistic career of her own!

Alce studied at Worthing College of Art and paints in acrylics on canvas and paper. Her work betrays a wide range of influences. Eager to experiment, she is well known for a broad spectrum of work, including landscapes and cityscapes, figurative pieces and more whimsical contemporary imagery. The years of hard work and dedication have now paid off and she has a loyal following which is growing constantly.

The show runs from "Saturday 28th July to Saturday 11th August":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/event/exhibition/200705141668 at Par Ici on Church Street in Twickenham.

There is a _preview evening_ with glass of wine on Friday 27th July, 19.30 - 21.00.
