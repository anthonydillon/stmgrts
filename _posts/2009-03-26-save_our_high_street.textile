    Not to point out Nosh in particular, but these are clearly hard times for nearly everyone and we need to help support our local traders.  We don't want St Margarets to become a shopping ghost town.  Just look at Church Street in Twickenham, nearly a third of all shops are gone!
    
    If you can, please try and use the shops in our community when you can and keep St Margarets alive and healthy.
