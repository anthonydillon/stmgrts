_Is your child starting school this September? Or are you thinking about schools for next year?_

Our FSS Education Expo on March 26th is a unique event offering advice, information and support on admissions, education and specialist help to get your children school-ready for reception this year, and to help parents make the right decision on a preschool or school next year.

Whether it's State, Faith, Steiner, Independent or Free Schools, you'll be able to find out more information, plus put your questions to parents who already have children are local schools.

And if your child is already in reception but not enjoying it or finding certain aspects hard there will be a child communications/speech specialist, fine motor skills expert providing helpful advice for writing and Barefoot Books with phonics and other useful starter books for children when they start education.
