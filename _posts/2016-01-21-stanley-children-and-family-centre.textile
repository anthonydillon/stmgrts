Children's Centres offer a fun, friendly and safe place for children to play and develop, and a place for families to talk to each other.

You can meet a wide range of professionals who can support you from pregnancy to when your child starts school. Whether you are a parent-to-be, a Mum, Dad, Grandparent or carer, you will be welcome.

Every children's centre has Family Support Workers and Childrens and Family Workers who can provide extra help when you need it. They could meet you at home, at a community venue or at the Children's Centre to talk through any concerns you may have. If you feel you would like some support to be able to attend an activity they can accompany you. They are also available to offer support to help families access specialist support should they need it.
