"Transport for London":http://www.tfl.gov.uk/streets/capitalcams/southwest.shtml has now installed a CCTV camera near the train station.  However, the police can also use the cameras, so hopefully it will help with any vandalism (see our article, "Bounty on Graffiti Vandals":http://stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2005/04/bounty_on_graff_1.html) in the area.

If you see any graffiti or vandalism occuring, call the graffiti hotline at (0)20 8891 7050.
