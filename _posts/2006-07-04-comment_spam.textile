For the past two weeks the site has been hit with hundreds of spam comments; hopefully, you haven't noticed anything. However, today the traffic has started to drag down the site.  -So we have turned on a system requirement that makes you to have to authenticate to post a comment.  Hopefully this is very temporary.- +We have installed new software that _throttles_ the number of post an hour and a day... let's see if this works better.+

If you want to post a comment, you -have to- +can+ get a username and password from "Type Key":https://www.typekey.com/, a free authentication service that lets you sign-in to many sites across the web.  -Or you can email us ("content@stmgrts.org.uk":mailto:content@stmgrts.org.uk) and we can post it for you.- +Or you can post as normal.+

Sorry for any inconvenience.
