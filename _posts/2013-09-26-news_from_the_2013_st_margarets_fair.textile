All the bills are paid and all the money has now been counted.

Unlike last year when our profits suffered from the rain, this year's sun - and your support and generosity - means that we have &pound;16,000 to share between our local schools and charities.

Orleans Primary, St Mary's Primary, St Stephens and Orleans Park get &pound;2000 each.  So our three 2013 nominated local charities share the remaining 50%, and they get &pound;2667 each.  They are - Me Too & Co, Together as One and The Portcullis Trust.

With the 2014 Fair in mind (Saturday 12<sup>th</sup> July), we're after some help.  We'd like to offer a new attraction for children between the ages of around 3 & 6, apart from the various fairground rides we already provide.  So if you have any ideas or suggestions could you put them in the 'comments' section below.  That also goes for anything else you might want to say about the Fair, good, bad or indifferent.

What we also really need is a bit of help.   If any of you could help for no more than a total of just 3 hours during the year, either at one of other events, the preparations leading up to Fair, or on the day of the Fair - that would be really useful, and very much appreciated.  The hours can be all at once or split up during the year.  If this is something you feel you can do please contact Julia Kirkpatrick either on 020 8241 1042 or email Julia at "juliamkirkpatrick@hotmail.com":mailto:juliamkirkpatrick@hotmail.com

Whether you have 3 hours to help, or just time to carry on supporting the Fair by being there - thank you.

The Fair Committee
