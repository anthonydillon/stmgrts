    In spite of us not providing the normal rainless baking hot day for this year's St Margarets Fair, your support was as always tremendous.  We'll know the exact amount of money raised for the schools and charities in September, but even given the weather it looks like being at least as much as last year.  Thank you all very much.  Although the money is important we always strive to primarily ensure that the Fair is an event for all ages and flavours of the Community.
    
    If you "visit our website":http://www.stmargaretsfair.org/Gallery2009/index.html you'll find some photographs taken at this year's Fair.  And if you're looking for any lost property please contact Julia Kirkpatrick on 020 8241 1042, who may be able to re-unite with a treasured possession.
