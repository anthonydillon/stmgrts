Friendship Matinee provides people who are part of a charity, community or voluntary organisation the opportunity to come to the Royal Albert Hall to see world-class shows for only &pound;5.00 per ticket.

In partnership with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra this year's concert, taking place on Friday 10 October, presents a tribute to the musical brilliance of John Williams, undoubtedly one of the world's most respected film music composers.



The celebration of this iconic composer will unleash the power of the film score in his internationally renowned blockbuster classics with instantly recognisable theme tunes, including Star Wars, Superman, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Harry Potter, Schindler's List, Jaws, War Horse, ET, Fiddler on the Roof, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Jurassic Park.
