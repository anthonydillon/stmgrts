The church also reached out to the community by offering "Prayer stations" in two locations; Moormead Park and on Richmond Road near Richmond Bridge.  Two teams offered passers by on the spot prayer for any issue such as relationship problems, job worries, illness etc. The teams saw between 30-40 people stop for prayer.

Towards the end of the day, Vince Cable visited the cafe at the church for an update on the day's progress along with local councillors Denise Carr, David Trigg & Michael Wilson.  Associate Vicar of St Stephen's, Andy Sachs, was there to greet them along with project organisers Helen Pett & Vicki Smith.  He then accompanied the project organisers to visit a house of multiple occupancy run by SPEAR in Twickenham where a team had been decorating all day.

Stephen Ely, Tenancy Support Team Leader at SPEAR commented afterwards; 

bq. "I just wanted to thank you and the teams that transformed the Heath Road house.  It was very heartening to see so many people so motivated to do this..."

Nick Brooker, Deputy Head of St Stephen's School also thanked the team;

bq. "We are delighted and grateful for the transformation of our perimeter fence and the litter picking and clearing of the Playground.  We all feel renewed and revitalized.  Thank you all!"
