As you will be aware from the media, colleagues in NUT will be taking industrial action on the 28<sup>th</sup> March 2012.  The action (a one day strike) will result in class or whole school closures across the country.

The decision to close the school or send pupils home is never taken lightly, but in this instance, where staff elect to take lawful industrial action, I have no choice but to take appropriate steps to ensure the health, safety and well- being of all pupils.

We are aware that school closures inconvenience parents and carers and so I am writing to give you advance notice of the likely impact of the action on this school. Our teaching staff belong to different unions and as it is only the NUT striking this time, we will be opening the following classes:

*6T, 6F and 3D*

All the other classes will be closed.

Thank you for your patience and understanding. We apologise in advance for the inconvenience this will cause.
