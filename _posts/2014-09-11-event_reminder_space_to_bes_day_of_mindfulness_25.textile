This autumn _Space to Be_ will be offering a Day of Mindfulness on 25 October 2014 and two mindfulness taster sessions on Wednesday, November 5<sup>th</sup> and Monday, December 8<sup>th</sup> at the Emmanuel Centre, at the back of St James Catholic Church in Twickenham.

Mindfulness is a practice which involves deliberately bringing your awareness to the present moment with acceptance and non-judgement.  Research suggests that meditation and awareness training can boost the immune system, significantly reduce stress, improve sleep, bolster creativity, reduce the ruminative thinking that leads to anxiety and depression and improve relationships with loved ones and friends.

Could mindfulness be your path to less stress and greater wellbeing?
