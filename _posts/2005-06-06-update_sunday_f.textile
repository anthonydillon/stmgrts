Apparently the Sunday Farmer's Market, which we previously reported "here":http://stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2005/04/sunday_farmers.html is running into a bit of controversy from some local residents who are concerned about the noise and potential rubbish.  While we understand their concerns, the market would only be for a few hours during the day, and we are assured that the pub will keep the grounds clean.

The addition of a Sunday Farmer's Market would benefit the community in that:

* it encourages the regular social interaction of local residents
* increases foot traffic on the high street to support local shops
* and offers residents chance to purchase fresh and organic foods locally.

If you support the Farmer's Market, we encourage you to "tell the Council Website":http://www.ukplanning.com/richmond/showCaseFile.do?councilName=London+Borough+of+Richmond+upon+Thames&appNumber=05%2F1000%2FFUL.
