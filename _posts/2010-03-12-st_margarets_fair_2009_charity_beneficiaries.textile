Last October we told you that how 50% of the &pound;14,000 profit from July's Fair on Moormead was distributed between the four local schools.  We asked you to nominate local charities who you thought might be deserving of sharing the remaining &pound;7,000.  Seven charities were nominated and their representatives came to our January committee meeting to tell us about their work.  I'm sure you'll appreciate that we didn't reach our decision easily as there was no organisation that we felt didn't have a good reason to receive some of the &pound;7,000 we had available.  We decided that three of the seven would be the main beneficiaries, but they were all deserving of some support.  Here's how the money has been distributed.

|&pound;2,144|FRIENDS OF CROFTERS|
|&pound;2,063|WHITTON SOCIAL CENTRE|
|&pound;1,942|HOMELINK|
|&pound;300|OFF THE RECORD|
|&pound;250|RICHMOND WELCARE|
|&pound;200|ME TOO & CO|
|&pound;150|MARBLE HILL PLAYCENTRES|

Thank you all very much for making this possible with by your continuing and generous support of the St Margarets Fair, which this year will be on Saturday the 10<sup>th</sup> of July.
