Mick Beck from Tesco has sent us the following:

bq.. "Following a fire at the Tesco Express in St Margarets, we would like to apologise to our neighbours and customers for the inconvenience this has caused.  The most important thing is that no-one was injured during the incident.  We hope to re-open the store on Thursday, subject to the necessary work being completed and new stock being available.  We are using the local church car park for staff and contractors whilst everyone is working hard to get the store re-opened and we have made a donation to the church as thanks for use of this facility.  

We would like to apologise once again for the inconvenience caused by the incident and whilst the work continues.  We hope to welcome customers and neighbours back to the store as soon as possible.  If you would like any further information, please contact our customer services team on 0800-028-6428."
