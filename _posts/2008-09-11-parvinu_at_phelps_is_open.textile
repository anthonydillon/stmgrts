They have been open for two weeks and when your website reporter called in the other evening seemed to be nicely busy. The bar has a great atmosphere, primarily due to the mix customers they seem to be attracting . Gavin Mitchell told us 

bq. "As you know we always believed that a responsibly managed bar offering excellent wines and easy dining in a comfortable setting would be well received in a community such as St Margarets. Judging by the response we have had so far we seem to be catering to the right audience and delivering at the right level. We aim to ensure that we maintain our standards and enhance our offering so that we can consolidate ourselves as a positive addition and be a contributor to the local community."
