New Year, New Venue and wonderful things are happening at Twickenham's long running Jazz Club which now joins the Eel Pie Club, TwickFolk and many others at The Famous  Cabbage Patch in London Road Twickenham.

"Twickenham Jazz Club":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/directory/music/200802050810 has had a rocky old road since its original conception by local musicians Kelvin and Lesley Christiane over ten years ago. Its original venue is now a Tesco mini store, another a pizzaria and so it goes on but the intrepid couple have managed to continue to create great Jazz Music in our ever changing borough, completely against the odds and maintained a very committed jazz following.





The move to the Cabbage Patch is inspired with the pub's positive attitude to music in the borough and Patchworks, their new purpose built music room, it gives the couple creative scope to again push the frontiers of Jazz presentation.

The monthly programme includes a Big Band Session with the in house Kelvin Christiane All Star Big Band.  The Band Session which may include quartets, quintets. even sextets of original musicians with music that ranges from the mainstream American Songbook, to self penned original music on the cutting edge of modern Jazz. The vocal session which is intimate and almost acoustic featuring our finest vocalists in a trio format, and there are ambitions to create a showcase night to present the new rising stars of Jazz..

It is wise to check the programme on the web site to make sure you choose a night which suits your Jazz preferences.
