    Two Twickenham mothers have launched a free, community website called For Sanity's Sake ("www.forsanityssake.com":http://www.forsanityssake.com) to help new parents find events, groups and services in their area. Their catchment area covers St Margarets, Richmond, Kew, Ham, Petersham, Twickenham, Teddington and the Hamptons.
    
    Rachel Mclean and Andrea Quintero set up the site after finding it hard to keep up to date with activities in the borough whilst they were on maternity leave.
    
    Having met in a mother's group, the now full time mum's, decided that a website was essential for those parents who might be suffering from cabin fever because they didn't know what was available to them.

Rachel Mclean and Andrea Quintero set up the site after finding it hard to keep up to date with activities in the borough whilst they were on maternity leave.

Having met in a mother's group, the now full time mum's, decided that a website was essential for those parents who might be suffering from cabin fever because they didn't know what was available to them.

A former Business Development Director, Rachel, said:

bq.. "When everyone else went back to work after maternity leave it became quite difficult to see what was going on in the local area. There was no easy, central source of information so we decided to put it all down in a calendar so you could see what was going in the local area on in any day of the week.

"We set up a very small website which was mainly for ourselves and our friends, with events in the calendar. This became popular so we decided to develop a new site with added features, such as social groups, meet-ups, a newsletter, blog with ideas for activities with kids, a community shop, free recycle of goods, discounts for members and a Reviews Forum to give feedback on local services."

p. Wednesday, 1<sup>st</sup> December, a festive themed party was held to officially launch the website, which now has 700 members.

As well as providing information on what is available to parents, the two women are also hoping that it will help avoid the dangers of loneliness.

Rachel, whose son James is one and a half, said:

bq.. "We have found that in this Borough there are a lot of professionals, who once they start to look after their children find that they don't know many people in their local area. A lot of mum's can feel quite isolated.

"There is an element of social networking to the site, so people that have met at a group or an event can meet up. We hope that For Sanity's Sake gives people ideas for getting out of the house and meeting others."

p. For Sanity's Sake have some great events in the pipeline. They are currently establishing weekend meet-ups for Dads, so if you're a Dad who finds themselves at a loose end looking after the kids while Mum has a break, then get on to the site and join their Dad's Group.

They are also hosting a Working Mums evening event with Zac Goldsmith as a key speaker on 17<sup>th</sup> March - the website has full details in the Inspiration Blog.
