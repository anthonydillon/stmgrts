On Thursday 22 April 2010, from 7.30pm until 9pm, at Realale.com come to a [free lager tasting](/event/event/200705142392).

We have teamed up with LOBI (Lagers of British Isles), the campaigning organisation which aims to promote awareness of lager that is produced within the British Isles by independent breweries.

We will be trying a number of different lagers from brewers including Freedom Brewery, Cotswold, Hepworth's, Harviestoun, West beer, Mitchell Krause and Randalls.

Representatives from each of the breweries will be available to talk through the beers and answer any questions. Click here to read more about British lager and the work of LOBI.
