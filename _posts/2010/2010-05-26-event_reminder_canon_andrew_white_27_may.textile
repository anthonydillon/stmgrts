Canon Andrew White (known as 'the Vicar of Baghdad') is "speaking at All Souls Church, Northcote Rd, St Margarets on Thursday 27<sup>th</sup> May at 8pm":http://stmargarets.london/event/event/200705142446 (NOTE: there initially was an mistake on this date!)

Canon Andrew White, often referred to as "the Vicar of Baghdad," serves as parish priest to a congregation of over 3,000 Iraqi people at St. George's church, and is the President of the 'Foundation for Relief and Reconciliation in the Middle East' ("www.frrme.org":http://www.frrme.org). Through the church and the Foundation, he coordinates delivery of humanitarian relief to the people of Baghdad. This includes the St George's clinic, which treats over 100 Iraqi's every day.

The event is free of charge (though there will be an opportunity to give to the work of FRRME for those who wish to) and there is no need to book.

For further information please phone the church office on 0208 891 6820 or email "ali@allsoulschurch.org.uk":mailto:ali@allsoulschurch.org.uk
