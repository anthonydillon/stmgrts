_Join us for a "scenic fun run":http://stmargarets.london/event/event/200705142491 set in the beautiful historic grounds of Marble Hill Park in aid of Cancer Research UK's life-saving work._

This will be a fun filled charity day with something for all the family. There will be live music and entertainment until 6pm, local food and drink stalls, face painting for children, a raffle with fantastic prizes and perhaps a celebrity or two along the way!

The 6k route is suitable for all fitness levels and ages and there will be a 1k children's fun run. You can take part as an individual or as a team, in your running kit or in fancy dress (there will be prizes for the best costume!). Organised by local volunteers, this will be a real community event.
