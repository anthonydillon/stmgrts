2x2 Opera for Young People is "presenting 4 performances of Rossini's brilliant comic opera Cinderella":http://stmgrts.org.uk/event/show/200705142623.   In this new up-to-date version Angelina, (Cinderella's real name), and her down-trodden father slave away in the kitchen of the family's newly opened cup cake boutique, 'Haute Petit Gateaux',  while her plain, bullying sisters and frankly ugly step mother spend the profits.  But a Prince with a sweet tooth is looking for a beautiful wife and there's enough magic in fairy cakes, cup cakes and small furry creatures to ensure that he ends up with the right one.

To make sure the course of true love doesn't run too smoothly there is always a case of mistaken identity, a ball that isn't 'strictly come dancing', sibling rivalry and a pair of slippers or,  for Rossini,  a pair of Tiffany glass bracelets.   Alongside all this mayhem and enchanting fantasy is the beautiful, breathtakingly inspired, witty music of Gioachino Rossini with original libretto by Jacopo Ferretti .
