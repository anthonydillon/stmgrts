Grassroots Grants is a funding programme targeted at small, local voluntary groups with a income of less than £30,000 per annum. Groups need to have been active for the last twelve months. Grants of up to £5,000 are available which can support a number of activities including running costs, event costs, training, building repair costs and more.

This fund, administered locally by Thames Community Foundation is coming to an end. The final deadline for applications is the 30<sup>th</sup> of June 2010.

RCVS are running a final [Grassroots Grants Information Session between 2-4pm on Friday the 11<sup>th</sup> of June](/event/meeting/200705142447). This session is open to any eligible groups based in the borough or who work in the borough. This is a very informative session which covers the Grassroots application process but also offers general advice on what grant makers look for and how to describe and measure the difference your project makes. A useful session for groups with no prior experience of making grant applications.
