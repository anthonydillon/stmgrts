Transport secretary Philip Hammond has issued this statement on allowing night flights: 

bq. "This morning I have spoken to Willy Walsh from BA and Colin Matthews of BAA for an update on the situation at Heathrow. I have agreed with BAA a relaxation of restrictions on night flights for the next four days. This means that operating hours will be permitted to continue until 1 am and arrivals for repatriation flights will be allowed throughout the night."
