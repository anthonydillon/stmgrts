Your children have gone back to school and you are thinking about their activities, what about yours?

As we get older we lose our suppleness- this is crucial to our skeletal health and to increase our capacity to be mobile for the longest we possibly can. We rush around and until things go wrong that affect our lifestyle and limit things we want to do we ignore the needs of our body and mind, and also  our emotional needs.

Yoga is an excellent way to ensure that our body and mind functions as efficiently as possible -unwind, relax, focus on yourself and your own needs at the same time maintaining and even improving your fitness of body and mind to keep us active in the long-term.
