### Ziggy Stardust Came From Isleworth

On the 23<sup>rd</sup> April 2009 the *St Margarets Community Website* carried [an article about Vince Taylor](/archives/2009/04/ziggy_stardust_came_from_isleworth.html), a 1960's rock 'n' roll singer born in Isleworth. After enjoying some moderate success in France Vince fell victim to the powerful psychedelic drug LSD. During his struggle to hold his mind and his failing career together Vince meet David Bowie who was inspired by him to create his alter-ego Ziggy Stardust, the "leper Messiah" swallowed up by the excesses of rock stardom.

> "Vince Taylor was the inspiration for Ziggy. Vince Taylor was a rock n roll star from the Sixties who was slowly going crazy... He always stayed in my mind as an example of what can happen in rock n roll... it seemed very appealing: Oh, I'd love to end up like that, totally nuts."

<cite>David Bowie (1976)</cite>

A BBC Producer read the article and now it has been turned into a radio documentary. As well as featuring some of the people who worked with Vince Taylor and helped with his initial climb to minor rock 'n' roll stardom, we will also hear from some of those who caught him on his way down, including David Bowie.
