From 25<sup>th</sup> October - 29<sup>th</sup> October 2010 in Twickenham.

Film Venture London are running a week long Intensive Camera Acting Course with director Graham Cantwell.

An intensive acting for camera course over 5 days in October. The last couple were a great success.

Practical and inclusive with a very small group to allow for specific, catered attention to each actor's needs. The course is designed to refine your approach to working in front of a camera and will culminate in shooting a practise scene on the Canon XL1, which you will get an edited version of to keep.

With an emphasis on practical scene work, the process of working intimately with a director and other actors will be deconstructed and demystified. The course will consist of 4 x 7 hour workshop days and 1 x 7 hour shoot day.
