Disease, dissection, and Darwin become the subject for artists displaying at the Riverside Gallery, Richmond from 4<sup>th</sup> December 2010. Orleans House Gallery presents Picturing Science, an open exhibition which examines the collision between two harmonious and contrasting fields of symbolic representation, Art and Science.

Picturing Science continues the successful programme of open exhibitions from Orleans House Gallery, Twickenham. After receiving 650 works from over 130 artists and an intense selection process, the judging panel whittled the submissions down to just 26 works in various media. The criteria included a direct yet imaginative concept and technical virtuosity.


The exhibition features experiments with ink, mould growth and microscopes that have produced visually stunning images. Julia Hembrow's Temporal Flow 3, could be interpreted as a landscape or figurative work yet is in fact a representation of the effect of early morning drizzle which fluctuates between scientific observation and visual art. Detailed anatomical and botanical drawings and three dimensional works such as Susan Harrison's ecorch&#233; inspired sculpture are also highlights.

Other exhibiting artists, both local and international include Anais Tondeur, Chris Boland, Nicola Simpson, Johanna Davidson, Amon Alt-Jafarba, Jonathan Wright, Pery Burge, James Collett, Tracey Holland, Pauline Pratt, Annie Ridd, Izzy Wingham, Fr&#233;d&#233;rique Swist, Stan A. Lenartowicz, Sally Hewett, Pascale Pollier, Hilary Arnold-Baker, Amy Louise Nettleton, Charlotte Padgham, Julie Light, Heather Jukes, Margaret R. Marks, Nick Pollen and Andy Dunn.

In addition Artist in Residence Alex Baker will be producing a series of new drawings made using sound and ink. He will also be working with the local community on a workshop exploring the effects of sound vibrations using his technique of drawing as a start point.

Curator Mark De Novellis stated: 

bq. "Although science is seemingly the logical, rational, ordered antithesis of artistic creativity, artists and scientists still share a common drive to innovate, explore, dissect and reveal. They have a unified love and awe for the world around and within them.  Exhibiting artists draw from a wide variety of scientific disciplines from botany, astronomy to astrophysics to create an accessible, compelling and though-provoking show that is not to be missed!"

The exhibition runs until 26 February 2011 and admission to the Riverside Gallery is free.
