Cllr Philip Morgan has been pressing the Highway Department to do this for many months; now, at last, it's happening. Work will start on Tuesday April 6 and take 10 weeks. There will be temporary traffic signals for the first two weeks of the project, off peak only; the current permanent signals will operate from week 3 to week 10.
