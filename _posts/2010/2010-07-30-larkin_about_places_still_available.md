With the summer holidays in full swing, we are now offering places on our Larkin About drama project for ages 12+.

Larkin About is run by Emergency Exit Arts and offers young people the chance to learn some new skills, devise a play and meet new people!

Larkin 2010 will feature drama workshops, singing, physical theatre and much more. Plus a very special drumming workshop with one of the cast members from STOMP! - straight from London's West End!

The group meet everyday starting from Wednesday 27<sup>th</sup> July at Orleans House Gallery and the final performance will take place in York House Gardens on Sunday 8<sup>th</sup> August.

This is a free project but booking in advance is a must. If you would like to come along, please call Anna Ramsay on 020 8831 6460.
