bq.. "Remains of a Roman village have been discovered only half a metre below the ground in west London.

The site has remained undisturbed partly because it lies in the Grade I listed Syon Park and has been protected against ploughing in recent centuries. But it might never have come to light without plans to build a new Waldorf Astoria Hotel."
