The two dates are "Sunday the 28th of November":https://stmargarets.london/event/event/200705142645 and "Sunday the 19th of December":https://stmargarets.london/event/event/200705142646 from 10.00am to 3.00pm.

bq. "The market will include local artists and crafters, live local musicians and other interesting stalls. There will be face painting, hot food, make & takes and a real Christmassy vibe, in the elegant setting of the Heron Square, set in the centre of busy Richmond, and accessible from Richmond Road, Hill Street and the riverside."
