excerpt: |
    GASS Day is on Saturday 11<sup>th</sup> September and starts at 1.00pm. The streets involved are Haliburton, Heron, Newry, Northcote and Talbot. To find them cross the A316, walk up St. Margarets Road towards Isleworth, turn left past the Ailsa Tavern and walk down Northcote Road. Voila!
    
    Adding to the day's sense of community at 2.30pm local kids in fancy dress will parade around the area "Beating the Bounds" with willow wands. Although the ritual is pre-Christian the children see it as pure "Harry Potter" with the presence of a kilted bagpiper adding a touch of "McMagic".
    
    GASS Day pitches are available to residents and non-residents alike. The cost of a resident pitch is £2, for non-residents it is £5. Please note that these pitches are for NON-COMMERCIAL purposes only.
    
    For more information or to register a pitch please call Laurence on 0208 400 9822

In 2004 the [North St Margarets Residents Association (NSMRA)](http://www.nsmra.co.uk/) organised a 'one-off' event that became an annual occurrence and now in its 7<sup>th</sup> year is turning into a tradition - The Grand Annual Street Sale a.k.a GASS Day.

The procedure is simplicity itself. At 1.00pm on Saturday 11<sup>th</sup> September the residents of the NSMRA community will put tables outside their houses, cover them with all the things that they no longer need - books, records, toys, clothes and so on - and then sell them for knock down prices. It is rather like a car boot sale in the street - but without the car or the boot. The range of goods is huge from furniture and designer clothes through to hot dogs, home made cakes, pickles and jams, bric-a-brac, televisions and DVD's. The neighbourhood police come to give advice on home security and to mark bicycles and our local church, All Souls, will be involved with a Fair Trade stall and a café.
