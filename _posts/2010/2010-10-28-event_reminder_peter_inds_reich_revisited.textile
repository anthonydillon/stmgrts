Peter Ind, a long term St Margarets resident, and in last month's My St Margarets magazine, has a mixed media performance up in central London.

h3. REICH REVISITED - Wilhelm Reich, the Beat Generation and the Energy of Life

_A Personal Journey with Peter Ind: Performance 3<sup>rd</sup> Nov Cockpit Theatre_

A multi-media exploration of the work and challenging influence of psychiatrist and scientist Wilhelm Reich in the company of iconic jazz bassist, artist, Reichian activist and founder of Hoxton's legendary Bass Clef nightclub - Peter Ind.

Peter first came across Reich's work when he lived in New York in the 50s and was part of that loft scene of jazz musicians, artists and writers but Reich's influence on his playing and painting has been a lifetime exploration of Life Energy. With the help of jazz musicians and actors Peter takes us on that journey and a re-think of Reich's legacy.
