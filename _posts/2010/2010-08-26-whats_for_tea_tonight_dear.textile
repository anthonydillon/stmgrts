Dear Reader,

You might already know me from yellowwedge cheese or the My St Margarets Magazine, but I have just entered the blogosphere with what I hope will quickly evolve into an enjoyable food resource, "whatsforteatonightdear.wordpress.com":http://whatsforteatonightdear.wordpress.com/. Your visits and comments would be very welcome. As you'll see the site is also advertising my services as a freelance food and travel writer, do use the contact page on the site if you're interested in finding out more. I hope you enjoy your visit!

Philip Brocklehurst
