Richmond Council has negotiated the purchase of part of the former St John's hospital site, in Strafford Road, Twickenham, for further primary school provision, subject to approval from Cabinet on Monday 22 February.

The purchase from the current owners, the South West London Mental Health Trust (MHT), will be conditional upon planning permission being obtained for the site.

It is anticipated that a planning application will be submitted later this year.


Cllr Malcolm Eady, Cabinet Member for Children's Services and Culture on Richmond Council said;

bq.. "There is a high demand for primary school places in the East Twickenham and St Margarets area which has caused concern among parents for a number of years. I am very pleased that we will be able to obtain this site for school place provision.

"The purchase is subject to Cabinet approval on Monday, at which point we will be able to begin work on specific plans. If planning approval is obtained we will press hard for the new places to be available as soon as possible."

p. The plans are part of the Council's borough-wide school expansion programme.
