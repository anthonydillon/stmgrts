This one is almost convincing.  "Helping Arms" make claims to support University College Hospital.  The company is registered with Companies House, not once but twice having previously been dissolved and only registered again in January 2010.  According to the "Helping Arms" site they have applied to register the charity but there is no record on the "charity-commission.gov.uk website":http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk.  They have "rulings against them by the Advertising Standards Agency":http://www.asa.org.uk/Complaints-and-ASA-action/Adjudications/2007/7/Rogaile-Ltd/TF_ADJ_42848.aspx and complaints from other parts of the country.
