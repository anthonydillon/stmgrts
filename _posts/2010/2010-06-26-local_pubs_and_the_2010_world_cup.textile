bq. "I went out and took some photos this evening in three of the local St Margaret pubs The Turks Head, St Margarets Pub, Marble Hill Pub during the World cup England game. ... (Everyone) was very friendly and kind and the atmosphere in each pub was different but all very community driven and fun."
