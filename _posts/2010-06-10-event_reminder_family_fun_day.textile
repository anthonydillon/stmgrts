_Punch and Judy will be visiting St Margarets this weekend!_

Mr Punch Entertainment Ltd is delighted to confirm that Punch and Judy have agreed to entertain children of all ages at this "Sunday's Family Fun Day":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/event/fair/200705142440.

The St Margarets Family Fun Day takes place in Crown Road St Margarets this Sunday from 11.00am.

Mr Punch added that the Punch and Judy shows will obviously be the main attraction but other entertainment is also planned and will feature live music from local bands and groups with something for everyone including rock & pop, jazz, opera and soul. There are magic shows, the St Stephens puppets, side stalls, games and completions including the St Margarets tug of war challenge and a charity casino.

Mr Punch is also looking forward to sampling some great food on the day including his all time favourite - Sausages!
