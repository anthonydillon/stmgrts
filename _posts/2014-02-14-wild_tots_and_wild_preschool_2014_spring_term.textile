    Ellie set up Wild Education when she trained as a Forest School practitioner and realized the importance of natural play and learning.
    
    Forest School is an ethos of education which has arrived from Scandinavia and is growing in popularity in UK nurseries and primary schools.  It is focused on regular child led learning in a natural environment.

bq. "I can't enthuse enough about the benefits of getting our young people outdoors; having adventures, taking responsibility, learning how best to take risks, to cooperate together, to negotiate and compromise while stretching their legs and their imagination. They'll learn to use their initiative, solve problems, learn about and respect each other and their environment and have enormous fun!"
