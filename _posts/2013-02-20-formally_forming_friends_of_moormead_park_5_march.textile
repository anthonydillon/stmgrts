An Open Meeting will be held at "The Winchester Hall, Turk's Head,
Winchester Road on Tuesday 5<sup>th</sup> March at 7pm":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/event/meeting/200705143812

Further to a meeting in January this meeting is to formally form 'Friends of Moormead'. The 'Friends of Moormead' will neither be a legislative nor an enforcement body. It will exist solely to further the full enjoyment of Moormead Park by advising and consulting with LBRUT.

The more people who join the 'Friends of Moormead' the louder our voice to ensure we safeguard its future use for the local and wider community.
