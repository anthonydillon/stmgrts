Lidl are developing a planning application and they are holding a Public Consultation evening on Friday, 14 November 2014 from 4 to 8pm at the Crossway Centre, part of St Stephen's Church.

They have sent a letter to many local residents looking for support.  It appears that they have already purchased the Ryde House site and they are hoping to knock down the existing building and build a food store with 24 flats above.

There is a website with more information "www.richmondroad.lidl.co.uk":http://www.richmondroad.lidl.co.uk and an online petition to support the idea "www.gopetition.com/petitions/support-lidl-in-twickenham.html":http://www.gopetition.com/petitions/support-lidl-in-twickenham.html.
