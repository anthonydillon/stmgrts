"Friends of Orleans Infant School (FOOI)":/directory/charity/200604150358 is a registered charity that raises money to enhance the pupils learning and their time at the school.  They hold a series of events throughout the year including summer and Christmas Fairs, quiz night (parents only) and a valentines disco.  This year for the first time they held a popular pamper evening and will be organising a "day trip to France":/event/Tour/200604150412 (parents only).  The numbers of members varies with every school year but there are normally about 8-10 members.

In the past couple of years, they have spent money on digital whiteboards for classrooms, replacing library books and refurbishing the school library, drama, music and sports days and outings for the children.

FOOI has close links with the local traders association who have helped FOOI many times with events and donations.  They also help out by supplying volunteers to the St Margarets Fair (running the BBQ last year)  and  are also building ongoing relationships with local businesses.
 
This year they are hoping to raise a record sum towards refurbishing the playground.  They always need extra volunteers, more money and raffle prizes -- you can contact FOOI through the school office at:  Orleans Infant School, Hartington Road, Twickenham, TW1 3EN.

NOTE: _They are also planning a "St Georges Day Celebration":/event/Fair/200604150407 at the Turk's Head on the 23<sup>rd</sup> April._
