On Monday 4 October the Council replaced the scratch cards used for visitor and trader parking with new parking 'accounts' in partnership with RingGo. One reason for this change was that the Parking shops are closing at the end of the year.  The original plan was that residents and traders would register for a parking account which would let you book parking sessions for vehicles only by phone, after initially completing an application form. However it has now been agreed to offer the resident visitor voucher scheme both in the paper and electronic formats. This decision was taken in the light of the problems being encountered by some residents.  At the moment it appears that if you do opt for the telephone system you can't also buy the books of vouchers.  The Council are still deciding how the vouchers will be distributed once the Parking shops close, and they will currently remain at the same price.
