Join Walkie Talkies the new drop off play club for 1 - 3 year olds, focusing on child-led creative play with more structured Music and Dance fun to finish!

This play club is the perfect break for Mums or caregivers who need a couple of hours to themselves and want their children to be engaged in a stimulating and safe environment with other children of a similar age.

Both Mums themselves - Jodie and Margaret have worked with young children for many years and love toddlers! Jodie is a trained professional dancer and teacher and Margaret has worked in childcare and teaching primary and secondary school music for many years.

_Only a few spaces remaining for January 2016_
