The annual festival of outdoor children's theatre, Larks in the Parks, kicked off this week with an exciting performance in the grounds of Orleans House Gallery.

'Doctor Nose Travels Through Time' is one of 10 shows by touring theatre companies that have been specially tailored for children aged three to 11 years.

Other highlights of the action-packed programme are presentations about a magic wizard castle, a lost kangaroo, a mischievous toad, a giant six ft book, a big bad wolf and a band of crazy pirates.

There is also the opportunity for children to get involved in outdoor drama workshops after some of the shows.

Performances will be held in a number of venues including: Sandy Lane Recreation Ground, Palewell Common, Moormead Park, Broom Road Recreation Ground, Mortlake Green, Kneller Gardens, Hampton Common and Castlenau Recreation Ground. They will run every Tuesday and Thursday up until the 28 August. Tickets cost &pound;4 per child for each performance and all adults, carers and children over 14 or under the age of two are welcome to come for free.

The events will also feature a campaign by the Council's Parks and Open Spaces team, 'Play Cool', which will promote the need for children to play safe in the sun. They will be handing out free reusable water bottles, cotton hats and information about sun awareness.
