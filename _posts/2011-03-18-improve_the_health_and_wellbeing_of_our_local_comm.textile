Local Yoga and Music teacher Surya Cooper and Alexandra Scott, who is a Complementary Therapist based in Sussex and will be hosting a Health and Wellbeing day in early July 2011.

The Health and Wellbeing day will be held at Richmond Adult and Community College on Saturday 2<sup>nd</sup> July 2011 from 10am till 4pm.

The day will be a chance for local therapists within the area to show off their wares to the public, give taster sessions of their treatments and help to raise some money for Shooting Star Children's Hospice.


When asked about what kind of day it would be Surya said " This is a great opportunity for therapists and everyone involved in the areas of Health and Wellbeing to promote themselves, as well as raising money for an extremely worthwhile cause"

This Health and Wellbeing Day is aimed at people within the local community to get together and share their expertise and knowledge not just with other therapists but also with members of the public who may have never thought of finding an alternative way to look after themselves.
