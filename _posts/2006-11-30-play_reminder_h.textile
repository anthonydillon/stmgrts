*THE EGG MAN COMETH*

It's panto time again (oh yes, it is!), and audiences young and old will flock for an evening of Christmas magic and mirth as some of theatre's best-loved characters don their makeup and tread the boards.

Among perennial favourites in the panto calendar is original egg-man Humpty Dumpty, and this year there's no need to shell out a fortune on train fares (oh no, there isn't!) to witness the fun.

From 7th to 16th December the Richmond Shakespeare Society stages this evergreen Xmas classic right on the doorstep at the eggscellent Mary Wallace Theatre beside the Thames at Twickenham, and so the youngest fans don't miss their bedtime, there'll be two Saturday matinees, not one.

As well as the unfortunate Humpty, the cast of comic characters includes King Addlepate the Dozenth, Wizard Fowlpest, chief chicken maid and classic panto Dame Hetty Hencake, pulchritudinous Princess Eglantine and a full supporting cast to bring the RSS's 2006 season to an eggciting end.
