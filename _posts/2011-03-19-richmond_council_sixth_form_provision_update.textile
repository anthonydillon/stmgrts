Parents and young people in Richmond upon Thames are being asked for their views on sixth form provision in the borough. A survey due to be launched online in the next few weeks will ask pupils and parents for their views on sixth form provision as it currently exists and what they would like to see available in the future.

The current administration has committed to promoting sixth forms in the borough's secondary schools as part of its strategy to further increase choice and quality in local education for residents.



Cllr Paul Hodgins, Richmond Council's Cabinet Member for Schools, said: 

bq.. "Last December, the Council's Cabinet agreed to jointly explore with schools the feasibility of establishing viable sixth form provision in our eight secondary schools and academies.

"We want to expand the range of post-16 provision in the borough. Our secondary schools have worked extremely hard to raise standards in 11-16 education. Two of our secondaries are now rated outstanding by Ofsted, and as a group they have moved up the national tables. Richmond upon Thames College and Richmond Adult Community College also continue to provide a very broad range of excellent post 16 options to our students."
