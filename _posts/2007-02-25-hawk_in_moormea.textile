bq.. "I thought local 'bird loving' residents may be interested to hear that a large hawk has been seen at the top of Sidney Road and also on Moormead Park.

I have spoken to a few residents that have thought squirrels may be to blame for the recent  significant reduction of small birds in the area, and this bird of prey may be the cause.

If the hawk decides to nest in the area, it could decimate the local bird community; especially, as it is large enough to take a cat or very small dog. I personally saw it catch a black song bird and its mate in one claw, but was unsuccesful in getting the bird to drop its prey. The bird stands approximately two feet high, and has a wingspan of over three feet.

The sighting has been reported to both the RSPCA and the local council."
