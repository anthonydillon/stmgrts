Local community choir Vocality is a fun and friendly choir which offers a warm welcome to new members. We sing and perform uplifting harmony songs - jazz, gospel, folk, pop - from around the world, without sheet music so anyone can do it. It's a great way to meet local people, and to boost your energy and spirits. Our summer term begins on Tuesday 29<sup>th</sup> April 2014 with weekly rehearsals (8.00 - 10.00pm) at St Mary's School, Richmond Road.
