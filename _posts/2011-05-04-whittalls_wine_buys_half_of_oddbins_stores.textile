bq.. "Whittall's Wine Merchants has agreed to buy almost half of the remaining Oddbins stores open for business.

Whittall's, a subsidiary of multi-millionaire Raj Chatha's EFB Group, will take on 37 of the 85 stores still open, with the rest staying in the hands of administrator Deloitte.

The sale should help secure about 200 jobs."
