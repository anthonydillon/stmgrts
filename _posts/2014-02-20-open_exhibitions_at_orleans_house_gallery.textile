Orleans House Gallery stages a number of open exhibitions, where artists from across the UK submit work to a range of themed exhibitions.

This year, we have 4 more opportunities for artists to take part in exhibitions at Orleans house Gallery and Stables Gallery in Twickenham and the Riverside Gallery in Richmond.

The first is The New Georgians which takes place at Orleans House Gallery and celebrates the influences of the Georgians on modern art, craft and design.
