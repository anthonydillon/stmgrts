Richmond based 'choir-with-a-difference' Vocality offers to warm the cockles of your heart this winter with the pleasure of communal singing..

"Vocality":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/directory/group/201103021201 rehearses in central Richmond on Tuesday evenings 8.00-10.00pm, and is now welcoming new members as it begins a fresh programme of uplifting harmony songs from around the world.

No auditions and no sheet music means that anyone can enjoy singing with this choir. Their fun and friendly approach attracts people of all ages and already counts a number of St Margarets residents among its members.

Their experienced choir leader will soon have you relishing the sounds of an energetic Slokavian gypsy dance, a spine-tingling African American spiritual, a delicate Swedish folk song and an evocative Bugundian Christmas Carol, among others in this term's repertoire.

The choir will be giving a pre-Christmas performance to showcase their achievements.

Vocality is offering a free taster session to try it out. Please see their new website "www.vocalitysinging.co.uk":http://www.vocalitysinging.co.uk for more details.
