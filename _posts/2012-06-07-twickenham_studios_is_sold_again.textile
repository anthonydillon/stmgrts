bq.. "The joint administrators are pleased to announce that following the re-marketing of the Studios, a successful bidder has been found. Sixty-two confidentiality letters were sent out, of which 21 were returned, and these all received sales packs."

"A number of offers were received and on Friday, 1 June 2012, contracts were exchanged with a third party to acquire the Studios as a going concern, retaining all of the staff. A 10% deposit has been paid to the joint administrators' solicitors and it is envisaged that completion will take place later this year. At this stage, the purchaser wishes to remain anonymous and further details will be released after completion."
