On "Thursday March 17<sup>th</sup>":http://stmgrts.org.uk/event/event/200705142659, For Sanity's Sake are hosting a Working Mums networking/chat evening in Richmond, Surrey, with a whole host of inspirational Mums attending, as well as stalls showcasing local entrepreneurial Mums' businesses, franchises and social enterprises.

Three speakers will be entertaining and informing us for part of the evening:

* *Zac Goldsmith*, _Richmond Park and North Kingston MP_ and *Pamela Fleming*, _South Richmond Conservative Strategic Cabinet Member for Community Development_ will outline services that the council offer to support and nurture small businesses and Social Enterprises.
* *Sara Guiel*, Mum of three and co-founder of the _Mumpreneurs Networking Club_ and founder of _Mums Inc_ magazine, will talk about how she came up with her business ideas, how she ended up with fingers in so many pies and how she holds it all together!
* *Joy Mohindra*, a Mum of an 18 month year old boy and a Criminal Barrister, will talk about feelings regarding going back to work, childcare options, changing priorities, the daily routine and the reality of being back in a part-time/full-time role.


At the event we are offering working Mums the opportunity to host a stall in order to sell/inform or network with Working Mums on the night. If this is of interest to you please get in contact with Rachel at "rachel@forsanityssake.com":mailto:rachel@forsanityssake.com. There will be a relaxed atmosphere in which you can talk to other Mums in the same boat as yourself as well as meeting others who are doing something entirely different, which might give you food for thought!

Talk to others about the juggle of work and family life, as well as childcare options and outside perceptions of Working Mums. If you're looking for new business contacts come along and see who you can meet.

Places are limited and pre-booking is required. For full details and to book your spot go to "www.forsanityssake.com":http://www.forsanityssake.com and see Working Mums Event on the homepage. For Sanity's Sake is a free, community website which has a calendar of events to keep you up-to-date with everything that's going on in the local area, everyday of the week.
