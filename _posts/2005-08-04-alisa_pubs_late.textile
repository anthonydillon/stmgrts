bq.. Residents in North St Margarets may wish to know that the License Application for variation re Ailsa Tavern will take place @ 10 am. on August 15th @ York House.

_Anyone wishing to speak must give Notice to the Officers as soon as posible._

Should anyone wish me [Councillor Hambidge] to act as spokesperson on their behalf (due to them being on holiday) then I will be happy to do so  and would appreciate if they will advise me asap.

p>. from Councillor Annie Hambidge
