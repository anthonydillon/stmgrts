Remember the old "St Margarets Crown Road events?":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2005/09/st_margarets_au_1.html

Sadly the last ones where in 2005.  They stopped because the main organiser, Simon Chapman, could not continue to give enough time or gather enough support to drive new events.  However, a local teen, Jamie Parker, remembers them and, with a little help from his father and Simon, has restarted the tradition.  The Parkers have already secured permission from the Council, funding from the RFU and all required insurence.  They have picked 29<sup>th</sup> September.

Anyone interested in supporting Jamie or participating in the fair, please contact him at:
