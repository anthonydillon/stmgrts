Lady Gaga today announced she will perform the "most spectacular show London has ever seen" and even plans to build a medieval castle on stage.

The 26-year-old superstar said she has now outgrown the O2 arena as she announced her return to the capital for the first time in 18 months with a huge outdoor concert at Twickenham Stadium.

The singer promised a show of Biblical proportions that will see a huge, semi-circular walkway extending out onto the stadium floor. A Gothic-style castle featuring viewing towers and intricate carvings will be constructed.

She said: "The Haus of Gaga and I have worked for months conceiving a spectacular stage. The Born This Way Ball is an Electro-Metal pop opera; the tale of the Beginning, the genesis of the Kingdom of Fame. How we were birthed and how we will die celebrating."

The 55,000-capacity show on September 8 will be her first in London since 2010, when she sold 68,000 tickets during six nights at the O2. Her tour schedule allows for two extra nights to be added.
