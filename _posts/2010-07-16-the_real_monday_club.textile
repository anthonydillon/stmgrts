If you are a serious minded person who has an active curiosity, enjoys reading and discussing ideas across a wide range of disciplines and who has some spare time on your hands especially on Monday evenings and is interested in making new friends you may be interested in joining this all age club which has been running now for almost a year.

Past events include discussions of books by Cormack McCarthy, Phillip Roth and RL Stevenson, dvd viewings of The Wave and comedy shows by Chris Rock, seminars on the Chinese Communist Party and the philosophy of Slovoj Zizek and a talk about the nature of the miraculous. There are also events where the emphasis is on pleasure, consumption and the consolidation of friendship.
