Ossie _AKA_ Roger Stanley, scout leader for 1<sup>st</sup> St Margarets Troop is retiring this Christmas.  He joined the pack as a cub in 1950 and became a helper in 1960.   He has clocked up 57 years with the same St Margarets Scout pack.
 
Anyone who remembers Ossie and who would like to add a message to his retirement card please email "johanna_kitson@hotmail.com":mailto:johanna_kitson@hotmail.com
