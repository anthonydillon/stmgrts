We have been running an outdoor fitness company in southwest London for the past 2 years, and we have got two very good trainers to help us develop Moormead Park.

The way it works is you turn up and we create a fun and utterly exhausting fitness session, over 10 sessions we move you through a power, cardio, and lactic phase to give you a huge improvement in fitness. It is a really friendly environment for men and women of all ages and all fitness levels. The next ten weeks have a SKI FIT element to them.the first session is free, then it costs between &pound;2 and &pound;7.50 per session depending on how often you come. 

If you are not sure you could have a look at "www.one-element.co.uk/service-ct.html":http://www.one-element.co.uk/service-ct.html, or just call now on 020 8871 1295 and we can tee up a FREE trial session.

See you there soon I hope.
