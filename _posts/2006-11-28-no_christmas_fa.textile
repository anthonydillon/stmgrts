Sadly there will be no Christmas Fair in Crown Road this year.  The St Margarets Traders Association, who normally organises the event, has decided to take a year off from hosting the event.  The fair is an enormous amount of work for the Traders Association and requires coordination with the traders, local school PTAs, Richmond Council, Met Police, fun fair people, craft stalls, bands, street performers, street closure, insurance, lighting and clean-up to name a few.  Hopefully next year the tradition returns.
