excerpt: |
    Last night we decided to try the new Thursday evening fixture at the Turk's Head Pub, "Brook's Blues Bar":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/directory/music/200608250848.  On stage were "Fran McGillvray and Mike Burke":http://stmgrts.org.uk/event/Concert/200608250858 who played two great sets of classic acoustic blues well into the night.  The atmosphere of Winchester Hall was lovely with candle lit tables, a not to loud sound system, light food and a bar.  Its has more of a club feel than a concert, so great to bring your friends.  
    
    For &pound;7 its a good value and a fun night out -- highly recommended.
