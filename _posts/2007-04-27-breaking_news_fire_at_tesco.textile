We have received a report that there is currently a fire at Tesco.  Apparently there is a lot of smoke and a fire engine has arrived.  Everyone seems to be safe.

*Update:* at 6pm, I spoke to a fireman, still at Tesco, who said the "fire was in the store room and we still don't know the cause."

*Update:* _The Richmond & Twickenham Times_ have "an article on the fire":http://www.richmondandtwickenhamtimes.co.uk/display.var.1361302.0.0.php?utag=11331 with a few more details.
