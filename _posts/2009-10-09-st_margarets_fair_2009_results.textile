In spite of the not having the usual sun soaked Saturday and the somewhat inclement economic climate, this year's Fair still produced a profit of &pound;14000 for our usual fifty fifty split between local schools and local charities.  So a total of &pound;7000 has been received by Orleans Infants, St Marys, St Stephens and Orleans Park.  The money they each get is allocated according to a points system based upon the activities and jobs they undertake for the Fair.  This is what they did, and how much their respective PTAs have received.

* Orleans Infants ran the Barbecue - &pound;1 449
* St Stephens planned the Football and provided the Stewarding - &pound;1932
* St Mary's took care of all the Litter and the Programme deliveries -   &pound;2294
* Orleans Park looked after the Pimms and organised the Dog Show -  &pound;1328

That leaves us with &pound;7000 for our local charities. This year we're going to give everybody in St Margarets the opportunity to put forward their suggestions for some worthy local causes that could benefit from a share of this money.  So if you are a local charity or just want to suggest an organisation for us to consider please contact us via our email address "info@stmargaretsfair.org":mailto:info@stmargaretsfair.org

As always thank you very much for your continuing support of our local community event.
