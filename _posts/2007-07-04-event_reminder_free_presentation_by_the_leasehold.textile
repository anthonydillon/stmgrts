The purpose of the meeting is to hear from a representative of the Lease Advisory Service about:

* How to extend the length of your lease (and what the law says the lessor can ask for)
* Purchasing the freehold of your properties (Collective Enfranchisement)

Please note that any mention of LAG is an error.  The Lease Advisory Service is in no way connected with the Lease Advisory Group (LAG).
