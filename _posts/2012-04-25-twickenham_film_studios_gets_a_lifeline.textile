_Agreed sale will see the studios' work continue and all jobs saved, say administrators_

Campaigners attempting to avert the closure of Twickenham Film Studios are holding their breath after it was announced on Tuesday that a sale had been agreed to save the site, but the buyer's identity would remain secret until the deal had gone through.

Gerald Krasner, administrator for the studios, said: "It is the purchaser's intention to continue to trade as studios and to preserve all the jobs." He said the buyer had handed over a non-returnable deposit of &pound;100,000, but would not reveal the full purchase price.
