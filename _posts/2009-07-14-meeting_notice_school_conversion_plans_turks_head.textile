Nigel Cannings, a local resident with children at Orleans and St Stephen's, has arranged a meeting for all parents to discuss the proposed conversion of Orleans and St Stephen's into two form entry primary schools.

His hope is that a community-wide consensus can be reached on what parents want to see happen with their local schools, and that acting in concert, the views of residents might be heard.

The Turk's Head has kindly allowed the use of Winchester Hall, just by St Stephen's, next Wednesday, 22<sup>nd</sup> July at 7.30pm, and all parents and other concerned residents are invited to attend.

Nigel can be contacted at "nigelcannings@gmail.com":mailto:nigelcannings@gmail.com
