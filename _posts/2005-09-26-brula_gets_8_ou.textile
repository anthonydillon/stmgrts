Local restuarant, "Brula":/cgi-bin/directory.cgi?key=200507150434&action=getlisting was given an excellent review in this Saturday's _The Guardian_.

bq. If there is one thing that would most improve the quality of life for those of us living in the more piquant areas of urban Britain - apart, perhaps, from roadsweepers prepared to go that vital step beyond their strict contractual obligations and occasionally sweep the road - that thing would be a great neighbourhood restaurant 50 yards from our door. All my adult life, I was reflecting after lunch at Brula, I have dreamed of having such a place at the end of the road, perhaps in place of the bail hostel against the wall of which one of the neighbours was taking a decorous leak as I ambled past doing the reflecting.


bq. Brula, alas, is miles away in Twickenham. It is 50 yards from a colleague's front door, however, and should you ever take the Simon Hoggart Tour, do ask the guide to stop off there for lunch. Simon, I notice from a perfunctory Googling, has never mentioned Brula in his writings, and no wonder. Only a madman would give directions to a hidden gem such as this."
