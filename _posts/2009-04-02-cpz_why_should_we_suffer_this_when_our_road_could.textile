    These two photos were taken at the same time of the day (9 am); the one of Godstone Road is full of parked commuter traffic, while Winchester Road remains almost empty.  This is how effective restricted parking is at pushing more cars onto de-restricted roads like Godstone.  The only way to ensure this does not get even worse is to ensure Godstone Road is included in the CPZ.

<br />Winchester Road|

These two photos were taken at the same time of the day (9 am); the one of Godstone Road is full of parked commuter traffic, while Winchester Road remains almost empty.  This is how effective restricted parking is at pushing more cars onto de-restricted roads like Godstone.  The only way to ensure this does not get even worse is to ensure Godstone Road is included in the CPZ.

I have just moved into this lovely area with my young son; getting him to and from my car and home several times a day is a real problem for me. I'm sure most of the residents of Godstone Road have their own troubles coping with this unwanted traffic hassle and we can put a stop to it simply be responding to the Council's enquiry.

Please take some time to complete the request to bring organisation to our road and ensure we have a quieter and more hassle free life.
