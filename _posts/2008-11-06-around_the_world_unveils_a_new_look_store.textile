This weekend St Margarets based gift and homewares store, _Around the World_, is unveiling it's 'new look' under a new name -- _Denham & Finney_. Under the same management, Jon Denham Tompkins and partner, Emma Finney are expanding their existing successful gift and homewares shop to offer local residents an even greater variety of choice:

* Three large rooms with a vast selection of gifts, jewellery, aromas, accessories, wine & dine, homewares and furniture
* Competitive pricing to ensure shoppers can buy with confidence - price matching information is now available throughout the store
* Free gift wrap on all purchases, and free local delivery and assembly

To celebrate this change Jon and Emma are inviting local customers to join them for a glass of champagne as well as 10% off all purchases at their Christmas Gift Preview on Friday 14th November (4-8pm), Saturday 15th November (10am to 8pm) and Sunday 16th November (11am-5pm).

'We are very excited about our new image and offerings' states Jon, who set up _Around the World_ in June 1997. 'We are determined to deserve the support of our local community by offering a fantastic choice of products at competitive prices with great service. And the smart, fresh new identity to the shop will certainly help to maintain the individuality and character of St Margarets which appeals to so many of us.'

Existing customers will be pleased to see that many of the existing services offered by Around the World, such as a complementary gift wrap and handmade paper bag with every purchase, will continue under the new _Denham & Finney_ offering.
