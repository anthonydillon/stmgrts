People in the borough who work tirelessly to help improve the quality of lives for others can now be rewarded via the Council's new mini 'honours' scheme, the Richmond Community Awards.

The new community recognition scheme aims to recognise individuals who have:

* Brought credit to the borough at a national level through, business, academic, sporting, artistic or cultural achievements.
* Given outstanding service to the community over a number of years or in connection with an exceptional event or emergency.
* Improved the quality of life for local people by providing services beyond what they are paid to do.
* Benefited the community through community involvement or volunteering activity.

The scheme could see local 'honours' granted to deserving and high-achieving people from every section of the community, from school crossing patrols and charity workers to leaders of their industry.

* "Find out more and nominate your community hero by 11 July":http://www.richmond.gov.uk/community_awards
