Hopefully you are aware from the posters, My St Margarets Magazine, and official council notices, that our next community fair takes place on Sunday 6<sup>th</sup> December 2015 on Crown Road.

We are looking forward to welcoming everyone for a great day of music, entertainment and frozen fun for all, including an ice rink set-up in the St Margarets Tavern's car park!

h4. Parking and road closures

To facilitate this event, Crown Road will be closed to traffic from the St Margarets Road junction to the Hartington Road junction from 7am to 7pm. All parking in the road closure area is suspended for the day and in addition to this, six bays in Kings Road (three on either side closest to the junction with Crown Road) will also be suspended. Kindly please ensure that you/your visitors do not park in the restricted areas. All suspensions will be clearly sign-posted. Hartington Road remains open but with no left turn into Crown Road.
