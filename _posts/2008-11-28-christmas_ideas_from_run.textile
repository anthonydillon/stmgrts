Struggling with what to buy friends or partners for Christmas? Well why not get some personal training gift vouchers or a set of running group passes?

Georgie holds regular local running groups, circuits classes, early morning bootcamps and personal training for men and women, as well as sports classes for pre-schoolers and infants, all held in Marble Hill and Moormead parks.

Starting January 2009, Georgie is introducing a new circuit-style class in Marble Hill Park on Thursday mornings. This will be a one hour session, beginning at 9.15am, run along the same lines as the very popular _BootCamps_. All levels of fitness will benefit from the training. Men and women welcome, as always! Sessions are held term-time only.

Call Georgie Islip for more information on 07736 070612 or email "georgie@run.uk.net":mailto:georgie@run.uk.net
