After a major three week refurbishment, which will seem a bit like 'changing rooms' when the doors open! The interior has undergone a stunning makeover. Wooden flooring throughout, lovely wall lamps, striking chandeliers, and a cool and stylish wallpaper and paintwork combination.

The toilets have been totally transformed (huge sighs of relief all round!) and the bar has been cleaned up, new fonts fitted and the back bar revamped. We will have five real ales on, with a focus on London beers; particularly products from Twickenham Brewery.  The terrace has also been smartened up and new furniture installed.

The major job, however, has been fitting out a new kitchen. Out with the banks of microwaves and deep fat fryers, and in with a equipment capable of producing freshly made, seasonal dishes. The menu will be predominantly British, but with some interesting twists and influences.
