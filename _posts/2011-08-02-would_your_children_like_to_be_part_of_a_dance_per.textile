LOCATE dance festival, run by Richmond Council's arts service is looking for young people from the age of 8 to 12 to get involved with a performance taking place in the 20<sup>th</sup> century gardens at Hampton Court Palace.

This is an exciting opportunity to work with award winning choreographer Darren Johnston. Darren has been artist in residence at the Roundhouse, Camden, winner of the prestigious Herald Angel award and nominated for the Place Prize amongst countless others. His work combines theatrical dance and movement with playful costumes and witty ideas.

Rehearsals will take place over three days from Monday 8<sup>th</sup> August to Wednesday 10<sup>th</sup> August from 1pm to 4pm.


Performances will take place on Thursday 11<sup>th</sup>, Friday 12<sup>th</sup> and Saturday 13<sup>th</sup> August. There will be two short performances per day between the hours of 1pm and 4pm.

The children will be supervised at all times and parents are welcome to stay for the duration of the rehearsals if they wish.

Ideally we are looking for young people who are enthusiastic about dance and/or drama, with some experience of performing - although we welcome interest from those with no experience as well.

The performances will be outdoors in the 20<sup>th</sup> Century Gardens, set within the grounds of Hampton Court Palace.

Free tickets will be available for the friends and family of the young performers.

If you would like more information on the project or would like to register your child's interest, please contact Anna Ramsay, Arts Events Co-ordinator on 020 8831 6460 or email "anna.ramsay@richmond.gov.uk":mailto:anna.ramsay@richmond.gov.uk
