Over eighty St Margarets senior residents enjoyed a free Christmas meal on the 5<sup>th</sup> of December in the Winchester Room, organised by the St Margarets Fair Committee.  As well as contributing all the Fair profits to local schools and charities, the Christmas meal has been a regular event funded by the Fair since it started after the Queen's Silver Jubilee in 1977.



This year the meal also enjoyed traditional songs from the St Stephens Community Choir.  The longest serving member of the Fair Committee is Gloria Ketley, and it's Gloria who has been the prime organiser of the Christmas meal since its inception 35 years ago.  So thank you St Margarets for your continuous loyal support to our community event - and thank you Gloria for all your hard work for the past 35 years.
