_Dismay as many fish die in River Crane pollution_

Shocked nature-lovers woke up this morning to discover the River Crane poisoned, leaving many fish dead once again.

The Environment Agency was called following several reports that a section of the river at Twickenham had turned black and fish were in distress.

The source of the pollution has been traced to an outfall pipe upstream of the A30.
