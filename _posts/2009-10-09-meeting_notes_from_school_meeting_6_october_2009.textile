The meeting on the St Stephen's expansion was a success with overwhelming support to pursue much needed additional funding.  The Winchester Hall was full and Vince Cable came to offer his support. Nigel Cannings chaired the meeting with Helen Henderson presenting the issues in a clear and concise way. Steve White, Head of Building Projects for the Diocese, Liz Stubbs, Head of St Stephens, and Nick Jones, Chair of Governors, answered questions. Orleans Infants was represented by Kate Holliday, Chair of Governors. Councillor Geoff Acton also attended. It was overwhelmingly apparent that the Council has failed to take into account the inherent difficulties of expanding the site in its budget allocation, difficulties which Councillor Eady openly recognises.
 
The architects are presenting a third revision of the plans on Monday to the school head, the Chair of Governors and the Local Authority. We are not hopeful that the plans will fall within the available budget. Helen Henderson will send an update on Monday to attendees.
