We now have 10 qualified and DBS ( previously CRB) checked coaches which includes a female coach as we are hoping to be able to introduce a girls team in the near future. The coaching provided is for children of all school age groups.

In the summer, we run a u11s, u13s, u15s and u17 team in the Middlesex Colts Association competitions and arrange friendly games for children aged under 9. The outdoor summer programme will commence in April from our ground at Whitton Park (Wills Crescent, Hounslow).
