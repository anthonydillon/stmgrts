The theme of the fair this year will be - My St Margarets Farm! We will have a visit from a farmer who will be bringing a selection of animals from fluffy chicks and rabbits for children to hold and Pygmy goats and young lambs for them to admire. There will also be farmyard related games and competitions on the day.
