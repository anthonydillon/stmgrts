The weather forecast for Sunday is beautiful sunshine, so remember to pop-along to the "Crown Road Summer Fair from 11am - 4pm.":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/event/fair/200705143841

Crown Road is being turned into My St Margarets Farm for the day, and there will be real-life farmyard animals for children of all ages to meet.

That's not all:

* bouncy castles
* ball pools
* charity stalls
* hoopla
* food vendors including Sausalicious' German wurst and Happy Little Baker's cakes
* aromatherapy from Earthflower Tharapies
* delicious refreshments from the Turk's Head
* a Punch and Judy show sponsored by Gymboree
* massages from Time for You
* the Mayor

... and much more!

See you on Sunday!
