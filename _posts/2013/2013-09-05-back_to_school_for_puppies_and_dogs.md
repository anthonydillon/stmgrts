    Term time is starting again, and it's no different for Fetch! puppy and dog training classes.
    
    If you have acquired a new puppy over the summer, now is a great time to start training and socialising them. Our Puppy Life Skills Classes are designed to provide a foundation of new skills for your puppy and help prevent problem behaviours developing as they mature. The Puppy Life Skills Classes are held at St Margarets Catholic Church and there is no waiting for a course to begin. You can start within days of contacting us and the flexible schedule allows you to attend to suit your diary and your puppy's requirements.
