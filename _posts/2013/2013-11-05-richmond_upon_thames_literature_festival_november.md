*A fantastic festival of books & words, tales, talks, ideas & thoughts*

Now in its' 22<sup>nd</sup> year, the Richmond Literature Festival is a calendar highlight for the borough and beyond.

Taking place throughout the whole of November this years' main programme features an exciting and varied line up of authors, commentators and leading figures from the world of journalism, television, food, history and politics.

Here are just a selection of highlights from the programme:
