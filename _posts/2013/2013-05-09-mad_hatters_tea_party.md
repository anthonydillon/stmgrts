*London 27<sup>th</sup> May 12pm-till the cake runs out!!*

Join some of the Sesame community and students of the Masters course, to have fun, eat cake, and drink tea!! We will be holding a mad hatter's tea party to celebrate the Sesame International Tea week. We will have a variety of teas, coffee and soft drinks as well as cakes, biscuits and sandwiches to enjoy.

You will find us at the end of South Western Road, St Margarets, London, TW1 1LG -- we'll be the ones in fabulous costumes! So come and buy your afternoon tea and treats and then head to the park (30 seconds if that!) to enjoy the sunshine. It's going to be out 100% we're sure of it. Getting there: The closest station is St Margarets (5-10 minute walk) but you can also walk from Twickenham (10-15 minute walk). Any questions please get in touch.

Please pass information onto friends and family members; anyone who you think might be interested! Family/ child friendly! For further info and to donate contact Louisa Webster on <louisaisha@gmail.com> and see [www.facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/events/166859866811020/)
