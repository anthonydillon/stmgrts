> "Would you love to be listened to. Here's your opportunity - so long as you can listen constructively to someone else.
> 
>  Interviewing is conversation when we focus on one person at a time. This allows them to develop ideas, share experiences, and develop skills as a presenter and raconteur. Meanwhile the interviewer is learning about people, how to put them at ease, help them develop and bring their experience to the common human experience.
> 
>  Might this help you prepare for a real-life situation, develop your plans, bounce your ideas off other people, overcome nasty experiences, and enjoy yourself, develop your network of contacts and make new friends as you do so?"
> 
 Drop in if you are interested.
