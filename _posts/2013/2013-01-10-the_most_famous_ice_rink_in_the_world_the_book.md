excerpt: |
    Richmond's iconic and much-missed Ice Rink may be long gone, but as we are discovering, it is certainly by no means forgotten. The riverside pleasure dome played such a central part in the lives of so many local people down the years, that even 20 years after it was controversially closed, a warm place is reserved in the hearts of many for the icy relic.

Richmond's iconic and much-missed Ice Rink may be long gone, but as we are discovering, it is certainly by no means forgotten. The riverside pleasure dome played such a central part in the lives of so many local people down the years, that even 20 years after it was controversially closed, a warm place is reserved in the hearts of many for the icy relic.

The 'Memories of Richmond Ice Rink' Facebook group has been buzzing with tales from differ­ent generations, written by people who grew up on ice, and who remain connected because of 'The Most Famous Ice Rink In The World'; and buried in the foundations of the apartments that stand in its place, beats the heart of a proud, old local treasure.

Twickenham Alive and Legends Publishing have teamed up to produce a very special book for 2013, designed to encapsulate the amazing stories that we are unearthing on a weekly basis - real stories supplied by real people. Some will make readers laugh, some will make readers cry, but all will underline the continued community spirit that exists for Richmond Ice Rink.

The launch of the book will coincide with another landmark event, namely the return of an ice skating facility to our borough - Twickenham Alive is proud to have agreement for a rink to be built at the York House grounds during 2013.

'The Most Famous Ice Rink In The World' will be launched in the Autumn of 2013, but advanced purchases of the limited edition publication can be made now priced £12.00 \[plus P&P\]. Those who buy online before the end of July 2013 will also be eligible to have their name (or the name of a family member or friend) printed in the dedications section of the book.

Full details of the 'name in book' scheme will be available on the Twickenham Alive site soon: [www.twickenhamalive.com](http://www.twickenhamalive.com)
