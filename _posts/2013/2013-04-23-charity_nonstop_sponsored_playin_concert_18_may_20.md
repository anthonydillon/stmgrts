We invite you to join us in our Non-stop Sponsored Play-In Concert on Saturday 18<sup>th</sup> May 2013, at Sheen Lane Centre.

Come and enjoy an enticing medley of music including the finale to Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake, Schumann's piano concerto, flute concertos by Mozart, a bassoon romance by Elgar plus his Serenade for strings, Mozart's piano concerto no.23 , songs by Roger Quilter, Rossini and Mozart, Beethoven's Triple Concerto ( first movement) and the first movement of his 1<sup>st</sup> piano concerto, a concerto for piano and violin by Mendelssohn, the last movement of Haydn's Farewell Symphony and Dvorak's Slavonic Dances.

Or as a soloist or conductor you can actually conduct your favourite piece or play your favourite instrumental solo or sing with the orchestra. All you have to do is decide what you would like to perform and get yourself sponsored. Don't hesitate - get in touch now, we can discuss it with you. Our conductor is happy to help budding conductors and soloists.
