*Film Camps get off to a flying start as local company spreads its wings*

Dreamcatcher Media Ltd, started by local film and TV professionals Breda Fahey and David O'Keeffe, got their annual Summer Film Camps off to a flying start this week with the first group of wannabee young Spielbergs coming up with a psychological thriller plot they scripted themselves. They then got down to shooting their own movie under the guidance of experienced filmmakers.

Dreamcatcher Director David O'Keeffe said: "Each year it's marvellous to see the creativity of the young filmmakers and their enthusiasm for the project - whether it's their first time with us or, like many, they've returned again as an annual event."

Attendees learn the basic principles of filmmaking and then set about making their own movie under expert tuition. Everyone gets the chance to play the various production roles including director, cameraperson and sound operator.

David O'Keeffe continued: "The Film Camps appeal to all, whether they've experienced filmmaking before, have a special interest in movies or are simply looking for something different to do during the summer. By the end of day one, the noise and laughter of everybody working closely together with such enthusiasm is really infectious".

Owing to the growing popularity of the Camps, in addition to their base at Falcons Boys Prep School in Richmond, Dreamcatcher Media have expanded to include locations in Notting Hill, East London, Chalk Farm and as far away as Lincolnshire.

The five-day Film Camps take place Monday to Friday 9.00am to 2.00pm throughout the summer to the end of August. For enquiries call David O'Keeffe on 07977 067576 or 0208 891 6414. [www.dreamcatchermedia.co.uk](http://www.dreamcatchermedia.co.uk).
