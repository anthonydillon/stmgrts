You're invited to join the award winning Twickenham Operatic Society as they take you back to a time when hair was big, greed was good, collars were up, and a wedding singer might just be the coolest guy in the room.

It's 1985 and rock-star wannabe Robbie Hart is New Jersey's favourite wedding singer. He's the life of the party, until his own fiancée leaves him at the altar. Shot through the heart, Robbie makes every wedding as disastrous as his own. Enter Julia, a winsome waitress who wins his affection. As luck would have it, Julia is about to be married to a Wall Street shark, and unless Robbie can pull off the performance of a decade, the girl of his dreams will be gone forever.
