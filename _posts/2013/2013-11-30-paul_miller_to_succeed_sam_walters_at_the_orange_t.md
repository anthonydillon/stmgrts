We're delighted to announce the appointment of Paul Miller as the next Artistic Director of the Orange Tree Theatre. He is currently an Associate Director at Sheffield Crucible. He will succeed Sam Walters, who founded the Theatre in 1971, in July 2014.

Artistic Director Sam Walters added: "I am delighted that Paul Miller is taking over from me. I wish him all the very best and know that he will find our audiences as committed, supportive and demanding as I have."

Commenting on his appointment, Paul Miller said: "I am thrilled and honoured to succeed Sam Walters at the Orange Tree. Sam has created a very special place: an intimate in-the-round space where new plays and neglected treasures shed light on each other. It's a privilege to take his vision forward and I can't wait to start putting the new and the rare together in the Orange Tree's unique way."

Paul Miller has been an Associate Director at Sheffield Crucible since 2009, and has also worked at the National Theatre, Bush Theatre, Royal Court, and in the West End.
