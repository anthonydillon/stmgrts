Household real Christmas trees will be collected for recycling between Monday 7 and Friday 18 January 2013 on the same day as your normal waste and recycling collections.

Real Christmas trees only - remove all decorations, pots and stands. Present trees whole unless more than 3 metres long. Please cut trees longer than this into smaller pieces.

Put your tree out on your normal collection day in a place that is easy to see but does not block the pavement, ideally next to your recycling containers.

Last year we collected around 20,000 Christmas trees for recycling which was fantastic. However, high demand means _we may not collect all trees immediately. If yours is not taken first time, put it out again the following week on your collection day._
