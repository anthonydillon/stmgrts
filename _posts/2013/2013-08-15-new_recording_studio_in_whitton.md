"The Freak Machine" is a new recording studio that has opened in Whitton just off the A316 by a long term St Margarets local, who previously worked in the Twickenham Film Studios for over 8 years.

They offer anything from full band and V/O recordings to full on collaboration and production for singer songwriters. Any budding St Margarets bands a very welcome at the facility.
