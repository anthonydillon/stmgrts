*Coffee shop Harris & Hoole angers Twickenham residents by applying for booze licence*

The "independent" coffee shop chain part owned by Tesco has angered local residents and police in Twickenham by applying for a licence to serve beer and wine.

The St Margarets Road branch of Harris & Hoole, in which Tesco has a 49 per cent stake, is seeking permission from Richmond Upon Thames council for the right to sell alcohol seven days a week from 11am to 10pm.

But Mark Halton of the borough's police licensing team, has objected to the application on the grounds that it will "attract street drinkers to the area and this will cause an increase in anti-social behaviour."

Mr Halton said that if street drinkers could buy alcohol from late morning "it will cause them to congregate on street benches" close to St Stephens Church of England Junior School.

"This will increase the likelihood of children witnessing drunkeness and urinating in the street," he said.

Mr Halton also revealed he had not been able to speak to management at Harris + Hoole to discuss his concerns because there is no phone number on the application.
