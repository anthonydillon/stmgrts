_Take tea in Twickenham with England's greatest landscape painter_

Celebrate J.M.W. Turner's birthday on "Sunday 28 April":http://stmargarets.london/event/play/200705143872 and enjoy a rare opportunity to eavesdrop on conversation with his father about life at his Twickenham home, Sandycombe Lodge, in the early 19<sup>th</sup> century.

Past Pleasures, renowned for live costumed interpretation of historical events, presents 'Tea with Turner' for the Turner's House Trust. It takes place at Turner's House, 40 Sandycombe Road, Twickenham. There are two performances - at 2 pm and 3.45 pm. The event includes tea and the opportunity to enjoy this unique building, which Turner designed himself, 200 years ago.

"The two actors who play Turner and his father, Chris Bailey and David Millinchip, have visited Sandycombe Lodge, picked up the vibes, and will give a cracking performance, taking us back 200 years to imagine their 'bachelor' life in a once-rural area," said Catherine Parry-Wingfield, of the Turner's House Board of Trustees. "Turner's father, a retired Covent Garden barber who kept house here, is such an endearing character and dialogues between the famous son and the sometimes inebriated father will really make the house and its past come alive."
