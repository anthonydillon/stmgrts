The Friends of Moormead was formally inaugurated at a well attended meeting at the Turks Head on Tuesday 5<sup>th</sup> March 2013. The appointment to the Committee of those who had offered to serve was confirmed by the members. Stephen Alexander and Mandie Adams McGuire were elected Chairman and vice Chairman. The other officers required will be appointed later. The Constitution, as required by LBRuT was adopted.

The meeting discussed a number of points, the Pavilion and the new tennis courts management, amongst others. In order to establish what the Friends of Moormead and other residents see as priorities for our park it was decided to deliver a questionnaire to all households in the area. The answers will help the Friends in their dialogue with LBRuT.
