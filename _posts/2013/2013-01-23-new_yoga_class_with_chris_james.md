> "Chris is excellent at judging how far we can go with positions and movements and we complete our sessions with a strong sense of having achieved more than we thought ourselves capable of. He is good at explaining the purpose of each position and he is meticulous about correct posture and movements. At the same time he is very attentive to any physical difficulties we may have. The result is that we feel with Chris we are learning Yoga to the highest standards we are capable of."
