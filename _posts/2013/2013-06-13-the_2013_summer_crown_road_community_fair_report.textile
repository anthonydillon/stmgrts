    Last Sunday, up went the bunting and balloons in St Margarets for the Crown Road Community Fair. The theme of this years fair was My St Margarets Farm - There were pony rides along Bridle Lane, real farmyard animals, such as goats, lambs, rabbits and ducklings, for all the neighbourhood children (and adults) to enjoy in close proximity.

Last Sunday, up went the bunting and balloons in St Margarets for the Crown Road Community Fair. The theme of this years fair was My St Margarets Farm - There were pony rides along Bridle Lane, real farmyard animals, such as goats, lambs, rabbits and ducklings, for all the neighbourhood children (and adults) to enjoy in close proximity.

The Mayor visited to see over 30 stalls that included beloved local institutions like the Turks Head's Pimms bar, delicious pastries from La Boulangerie and freshly made pancakes from La Creperie Bretonne. There were fortune-tellers, jewellery and fashions stands, cake stalls, a bouncy castle and the odd song or two from local choir Vital Voices. The St Margarets Tavern's car park was turned into a fairground, and local business Gymboree sponsored the Punch and Judy shows!

Many local businesses and organisations helped-out: Dolly Rock sponsored local resident Mary Regan's Cancer Research UK stall, helping to raise over &pound;400 for the charity, while St Stephen's offered children (and some adults, again!) free face painting and craft activities. Chase Buchanan sponsored the children's fun area and also to provided a Hoopla challenge which raised another &pound;100 for the Mayor's charities. The Tavern also sponsored Orleans Infant School's fun stand and St Margarets Pharmacy sponsored the ever popular balloon modeller.

The Turk's Head 10k Fun Run had taken place earlier, as organised by local resident Caitlin Limmer in a day that was a real celebration of the community. Many of the local businesses including Rock & Fairy, Herdman Carpets, Cutters, Thorougoods, Pilates Plus and Nigel Hare Joinery sponsored runners in the fun run which helped to raise over &pound;1000 for local charities. The Mayor presented cheques to the runners for their charities from the local businesses.

Thousands of residents turned out to enjoy the day which was nicely summed up by local resident Ann Murray who commented 'Events like this help to demonstrate the tremendous community we have here in St Margarets'.

The St Margarets Traders Association organises the summer and Christmas Fairs in Crown Road with support from Richmond Council and generous sponsorship help from the RFU and local property companies Chase Buchanan and Fitz-Gibbon.
