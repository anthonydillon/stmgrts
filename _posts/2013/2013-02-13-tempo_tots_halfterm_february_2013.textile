_Looking for something to do in half term?  Why not pop along to the fab TEMPO TOTS!!!_

Tempo Tots offers live music making as a developmental tool for little ones aged between 3 months - 4 years in RICHMOND, TWICKENHAM, SHEEN, HAMPTON WICK and TEDDINGTON. The classes aim to facilitate and enhance communication,  physical development and bonding between parents and their babies.

Each class is led by professional musicians and is packed with live music, singing, dancing and more, to help little ones develop their social skills, communication, movement and of course singing!

Your child and their friends will have lots of fun in the live interactive music making classes led by the class Tempo Tots facilitators on their guitar, keyboard, flute, cello and voices.  But that's not all, each class incorporates a weekly theme with stories, bubbles, puppets, singing, dancing and playing musical instruments!!

So if you're stuck for things to do this half term then why not pop along to a Tempo Tots Live Music Making session.
