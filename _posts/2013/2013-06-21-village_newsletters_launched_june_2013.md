As well as council updates, they also showcase the work being carried out by local community groups or individuals and let people know how they can get involved.

The next edition will go out before the end of July and the Council are now looking for story ideas. This is a great opportunity for local charities, community groups and social enterprises to include your events, activities, general promotion, announcements, launches, opportunities or general news. If you have any story ideas for the next edition, which can be for a specific area or for the whole borough, you can submit your story online. The deadline for stories is the 5<sup>th</sup> July 2013.
