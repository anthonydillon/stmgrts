Prudential RideLondon is a new annual cycling festival which will be held on the weekend of 3-4 August 2013. The Saturday event, called the FreeCycle, will see up to 50,000 cyclists on closed roads in central London. It will have *no impact* on Richmond upon Thames.

On Sunday 4 August, however, the cycling routes run partly through the borough. This means that roads and traffic around parts of Richmond upon Thames will be affected by two events:



# The RideLondon-Surrey 100, a 100-mile route for amateur cyclists, will begin at the Olympic Park at 6am.
# In the afternoon 150 professional cyclists will compete in the RideLondon-Surrey Classic, a 140-mile version of the amateur route. This race will start at the Olympic Park at 12.30pm.

The "routes are detailed on a map":http://stmgrts.org.uk/assets/images/2013/ridelondon_visitrichmond_map_full_size.png, and there is further information on this site about how the two events will affect local residents. For more details of the events themselves, and how to watch them, visit the "Prudential RideLondon":http://www.prudentialridelondon.co.uk/ website or email helpdesk@ridelondon.co.uk.
