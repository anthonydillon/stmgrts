You're invited to join the award winning Twickenham Operatic Society as they take you back to a time when hair was big, greed was good, collars were up, and a wedding singer might just be the coolest guy in the room.

It's 1985 and rock-star wannabe Robbie Hart is New Jersey's favourite wedding singer. He's the life of the party, until his own fianc&#233;e leaves him at the altar. Shot through the heart, Robbie makes every wedding as disastrous as his own. Enter Julia, a winsome waitress who wins his affection. As luck would have it, Julia is about to be married to a Wall Street shark, and unless Robbie can pull off the performance of a decade, the girl of his dreams will be gone forever.
