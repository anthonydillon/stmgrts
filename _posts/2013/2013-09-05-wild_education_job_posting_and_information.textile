_Wild Education - learning outside makes children smarter, healthier, happier_

After working as a secondary school teacher and for an expedition company for 10 years, local mum Ellie Wrigglesworth re-trained as a Forest School practitioner and set up Wild Education last year. Wild Education now has 5 staff all passionate about re-connecting children with nature and learning to play in the wild.





Forest School is an ethos of education from Scandinavia focused on child led learning in a natural environment. Research shows that children generally learn more effectively in the outdoors, gain in confidence and self-esteem, are more balanced, more able to concentrate, show greater consideration to others, greater social capability and better coordination.

We can't enthuse enough about the benefits of getting our young people back to nature, learning outdoors, having adventures, taking responsibility, learning how best to take risks, cooperate together, using their initiative while solving problems and having enormous fun.

Wild Education is based in Orleans House Gallery woods and has also run sessions in Crane Park and Pensford Field, Kew. We are currently running -

* curriculum time programme for the Year 1's at Orleans Primary funded by their PTA
* after school clubs for Orleans, St Stephens and St Mary's
* school holiday activities
* one off sessions for schools to fit with a particular topic
* a new pre-school session - Mondays 9.30-11.30 starting 9<sup>th</sup> Sept

We are also looking for staff (assistants and Level 3 qualified practitioners) who will be CRB checked and share a passion for working with children and learning outdoors.

If you want to get in touch about any of our activities or want to work with us do get in touch.
