Step back in time and enjoy an evening of dancing at the Strawberry Summer Ball on [Friday 28 June 2013 from 7.15pm to midnight](/event/event/200705143836) at Horace Walpole's gothic castle, Strawberry Hill, Twickenham.

Horace Walpole spent many hours enjoying festivities and Lady Waldegrave established a tradition of hosting magnificent balls at Strawberry Hill, attended by the leading lights of the 1800s.

On Friday 28 June, guests will be able to take part in dancing with The Covent Garden Minuet Company and modern dancing with The Allbeats. The Covent Garden Minuet Company will perform the social dances of the 18<sup>th</sup> century, in particular the minuet, in full authentic costume and guests will have the opportunity take part in the dancing.

In contrast The Allbeats are a three piece band who will be performing favourite music from the 60s to 90s and the latest classic pop music.

The evening will kick off with prosecco and strawberries and guests will have a chance to view the house and garden at twilight. Guests are invited to bring their own picnic or dine in the restaurant at Strawberry Hill.

The fund-raising event for Strawberry Hill is part of Twickenham Festival and is supported by Twickenham Town Business Association. Barclays Community Investment, Laverstoke Park Farm, Bingham and Garsons are also generously supporting the ball, with a host of local companies providing fabulous prizes for the raffle.

Nick Smith, Director of the Strawberry Hill Trust said: "We are really delighted to be involved in the Twickenham Festival by staging the Strawberry Summer Ball, which gives a great opportunity to enjoy an evening in Horace Walpole's amazing house and garden. This is one summer event not to miss!"
