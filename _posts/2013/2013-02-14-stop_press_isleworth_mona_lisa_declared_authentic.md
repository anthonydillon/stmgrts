After exhaustive tests experts have just declared the so-called 'Isleworth Mona Lisa' as Leonardo Da Vinci's original version of the famous 'Mona Lisa' now in the Louvre in Paris.

David Feldman, vice-president of the Mona Lisa foundation, an international group set up to demonstrate the painting's authenticity said, "When we add these new findings to the wealth of scientific and physical studies we already have, I believe anyone will find the evidence of a Leonardo attribution overwhelming."

Much of this new evidence was provided by Italian geometrist Alfonso Rubino. He had made extended studies of the geometry of Leonardo's 'Vitruvian Man'. When he compared his findings with the geometry of the 'Isleworth Mona Visa' he was convinced that both paintings were by the same artist.

Carbon dating tests on the painting by the Federal Institute of Technology in Switzerland also confirmed that its canvas was almost certainly manufactured between 1410 and 1455, refuting claims that the painting was a late 16<sup>th</sup> century copy.

The 'Isleworth Mona Lisa' is so called because it was kept in Isleworth by art connoisseur Hugh Blaker who found it in a country house in Somerset in 1913.
