    Congratulations and thanks to all those who helped organise and run this year's Crown Road Christmas Fair.  And to all the volunteers who manned stalls and helped make it run so smoothly.  The weather wasn't always looking so good, but it held and hundreds of people where able to enjoy the night.
    
    Thank you!
