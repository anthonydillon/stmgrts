    Tiny Tunes are fun, energetic song, dance & rhyme sessions for pre-school children. Tiny Tunes has been entertaining children across Twickenham & Richmond for many years, and have now set up classes at All Souls Church in St Margarets on Thursday mornings at 9.30 and 10.30. The classes are pay-as-you-go, so no need to book - just turn up and have fun shaking the pom-poms, playing the maracas, dancing with bubbles and singing along! As well as the all-time children's favourite rhymes and songs, we will get you dancing to some of the well-known pop classics!
