Surya Cooper said "It's great to do something we love while knowing that we'll be making a difference to children around the world."

Save the Children Chief Executive Justin Forsyth said: "Children continue to die from preventable diseases like diarrhoea and pneumonia. We're working hard to stop these needless deaths. I want to say a huge thank you to everyone who is singing for Save the Children - you should feel proud that you're making our work possible."

Every year 6.9 million children under five die from easily preventable causes like pneumonia and malnutrition. Save the Children is working to stop this happening and to ensure more children live to celebrate their fifth birthday and beyond, no matter where they live.
