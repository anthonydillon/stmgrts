See Shakespeare's madcap "Comedy of Errors":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/event/play/200705141659 on the sunken lawn at Twickenham's "York House":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/directory/historic%20house/200508171541 in the latest production from the Richmond Shakespeare Society, a perfect way to enjoy the fun and frolic of Shakespeare's shortest comedy on a balmy summer's evening.

The play, the Bard's shortest, and one of his most farcical, tells of two sets of twins separated as babies by a shipwreck. One pair ended up in Syracuse, the other in Ephesus where the play is set.

The classic tangle of Shakespearean mistaken identity which follows risks turning to tragedy, but eventually all comes out right, and a family reunion provides the happy ending that a feel-good midsummer play demands.

Tickets are already on sale from the box office on 020 8744 0547. Shows are at 7.45pm on Sunday July 1 to Saturday July 7, matin&eacute;e July 7 at 3pm, no show Wednesday July 4. Seating this year is picnic style on the grass, so bring rugs, cushions or deckchair.

Meanwhile tomorrow's stars have been treading the boards at the Mary Wallace with Stages in Time, a Youth Theatre roller-coaster ride through the history of theatre from the Commedia dell'Arte to the present day.

Director Katie Abbott says: "We had scenes from The Importance of Being Earnest', Richard III, Oliver, and a mini Restoration comedy, and the talented and enthusiastic young cast worked really hard to bring them all to life."
