The Council has announced plans to provide an additional 150 permanent reception class places in borough schools, in order to meet forecast demand. The plans include the conversions of Orleans Infant and St Stephens Church of England Junior into two-form entry primary schools, subject to the final agreement of all governing bodies concerned. The Council is consulting on these plans with schools, neighbouring local authorities, and residents. If the plans are implemented, the extra places will be provided from September 2011.
