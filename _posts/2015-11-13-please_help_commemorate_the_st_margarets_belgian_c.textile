St Margarets has a unique WWI history! We gave a home in 1914-18 to a massive Belgian refugee community, the largest in Southern England, and our towns developed a real Belgian character. We were called "The Belgian Village on the Thames". We want to celebrate our Belgian connection with a memorial at the place where most of the Belgians worked. This is not about war, but international friendship.

"The Richmond and Twickenham Belgian Refugee Memorial Fund":http://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/1ww-belgian-refugee-memorial-1 has been opened by the East Twickenham Centennial Group, a voluntary group set up to commemorate Richmond and Twickenham's Belgian Refugees. East Twickenham was the focus of the Belgian community, as most of the refugees worked here in a Belgian munitions factory beside the river.

They need &pound;8400 for the memorial, on top of our &pound;5000 grant from Richmond Council.
