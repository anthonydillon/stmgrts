You may recall that last year the council introduced an Event Day Only Controlled Parking Zone (CPZ) in all roads situated within East Twickenham controlled parking zone F and St Margarets South controlled parking zone S during the Marble Hill concerts.

This year the English Heritage concert at Marble Hill Park will take place on Saturday 23 August 2008 and Sunday 24 August 2008. The Council will once again operate the Event Day CPZ on these two days between the hours of 5.30pm and 8pm in all roads within zones F and S.

During the Event Day CPZ, parking controls will only apply to the following parking bays:

* Resident permit holder bays
* Resident / business (permit holder bays)
* Business permit holder only bays.

All other parking will not be controlled and will remain free.

All current resident, business or operational permits, valid in either zones F or S, are automatically valid in the Event Day CPZ.
