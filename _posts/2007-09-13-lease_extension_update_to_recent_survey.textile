Following the meeting in the Winchester Hall on 24 July a Lease Survey was distributed to those who provided their contact details.

Thanks to everyone who participated in the survey,  please find results attached. We had 36 responses which is just over a 50% success rate! Link to Lease Survey Results

Those who wish to proceed with a lease extension or purchase of freehold immediately and within the next 6 months will be contacted by email shortly regarding moving forward with the process as a group. Those wishing to pursue this at a later stage can view regular updates on this website.
