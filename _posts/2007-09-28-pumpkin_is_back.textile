Our black cat Pumpkin, reported missing on this website (see "Missing Cat No. 3 - Pumpkin":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2007/09/missing_cat_no_3_pumpkin.html), turned up on Sunday, 23 September after ten days, a lot thinner and a little dazed but alive and well. If only he could tell us what happened!

Many thanks to everyone for their help and support.
