    "_Kew Village Community Market_":http://www.kewvillagemarket.org/ is a local market that is run by the community for the benefit of the community.  The current plans for the market are that (when it starts) it will be held on the first Sunday of every month in Station Parade from 10.00am - 2.00pm.
    
    We've now believe that we've got enough interest,  helpers and potential stallholders to run the market for a 3 month trial period starting in October.  We're aiming to hold the first market on Sunday 2<sup>nd</sup> October, and thereafter on Sunday 6<sup>th</sup> November, and Sunday 4<sup>th</sup> December.
