As demand for primary school places reaches an all time high, more in-borough applicants than in previous years have been offered a place at one of their preferred schools - 91% compared with 89% in 2011.

On 18 April 2012, Richmond Council will be making the initial allocation of reception class offers for this September: 75% have been offered a place at their first preference primary school, a rise from last year's figure of 73.5%; 88% have been offered a place at one of their top three preferred schools, compared with 86% last year. Those who have not been offered any of their preferences will have been offered an alternative - or will be offered one in the coming weeks.

To meet demand for places, last year the Council announced additional investment to expand the borough's primary schools, as part of a 10 year strategy. This year, an additional three permanent forms of entry, for 90 additional children, will be provided at Hampton Wick Infant, Orleans Primary, St Stephen's C of E Primary, and St Mary's C of E Primary. The provision of the 60 additional places within St Margarets and central/East Twickenham has been particularly helpful in greatly reducing the number of children in those areas who would otherwise have been unplaced at the initial allocations stage.
