Come and see the lights switched on in Richmond Road, East Twickenham. The Mayor will be switching on the lights on the big tree at the foot of the bridge at "6pm":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/event/event/200705143701. The Salvation Army Band will be playing carols. There'll be mince pies and maybe even something to drink. And the shops will be open late for some present browsing.

_PS Santa will be watching who turns up, so if you want him to drop by with those gifts, don't miss it!_
