"The ARThouse Open Studios Festival":http://stmgrts.org.uk/directory/art/201006031129 for the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames this year has 82 venues to visit over the two weekends (Friday 11, Saturday 12, Sunday 13 - Friday 18, Saturday 19, Sunday 20 June), as well as 11 of the Borough's schools taking part.

The range of artwork created in the borough is fantastic, with art forms including paintings, prints, sculpture, ceramics, jewellery, textiles, photography and more. Many of the venues are clustered together within easy walking or cycling distance of one another, so it's a simple way to spend an enjoyable afternoon discovering your local artists and learning about the borough.

Open studio festivals are a fantastic opportunity to learn about new artists, chat about their work and browse their exhibition in an informal atmosphere. With so many talented artists and craftspeople in the borough there really is something for everyone.

This year we've introduced a Prize Draw to encourage people to visit new artists. Visit five or more participating venues, and you could be in with a chance of winning Â£100 to spend on the ARThouse artist of your choice - see the brochure for more details.
