During the Queen's visit to Richmond Park on Tuesday, 15 May, Sir David Attenborough dug the first spade of earth for the new Jubilee Pond to commemorate her Diamond Jubilee.

Funded by the conservation charity Healthy Planet, the Friends of Richmond Park and through a public appeal, the pond will retain water in the park and create a new wildlife habitat.

Sir David, who is a patron of the Friends, said "Water is the lifeblood of the Park, its landscape and its wildlife, but we so often neglect the Park's ponds and streams. Jubilee Pond is an important addition to the Parks' ecology".
