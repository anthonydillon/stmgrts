_A free summer party for all the family!_

As the culmination of a two-week Twickenham Riverside festival, Carnival will open with a colourful parade from York House to the Carnival Village in the grounds of Orleans House Gallery, Twickenham. The riverside will come alive with the sights and sounds of the Caribbean in a global celebration, welcoming the world to London for 2012. Twickenham's Carnival celebration will be a wonderful summer event with music, dance, food, games and children's arts activities.

From 1-5pm.
