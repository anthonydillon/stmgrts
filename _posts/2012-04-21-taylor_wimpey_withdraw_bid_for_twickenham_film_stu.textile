A property developer has withdrawn its bid for Twickenham Film Studios because it said it wants to give film consortiums a chance to buy and maintain the site.

Members of the Save Twickenham Film Studios campaign said they were delighted with Taylor Wimpey's announcement but were aware that the fight to save the studios, which played host to classics including Alfie and The Italian Job, was not over.

Campaign leader Maria Walker said:

bq.. "The CEO has agreed to back-off to give it a chance to be kept as a studio.

"We have won the battle; the fight is still not over.

"We want to get the message to a developer that does think they can get in - we will fight. In fact if anything, the campaign is growing, so it has not gone away."
