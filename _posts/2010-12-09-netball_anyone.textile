Teddington Swans Netball Club is looking to recruit new players to join the club.

We are a friendly, sociable club that play a good level of netball. We have 3 teams and train on a Thursday night from 7.45pm to 9.45pm at the sports hall at Richmond upon Thames College in Twickenham.

We cater for all standards and have an excellent coach who runs sessions which are a mixture of drills, fitness and match play.

For more information email "teddingtonswans@hotmail.com":mailto:teddingtonswans@hotmail.com or come along to one of our training sessions which start again on 6 January 2011.
