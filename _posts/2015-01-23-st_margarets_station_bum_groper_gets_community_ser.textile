A sex offender was ordered to complete 150 hours of community service after groping a woman's buttock at St Margarets station.

Ranjit Singh Soni, 36, of Summerwood Road in Isleworth, approached the woman in broad daylight, who was waiting for a train on November 19, last year.

He was also ordered to pay total costs of &pound;220, including &pound;75 compensation to the victim, at Wimbledon Magistrates' Court on Tuesday, January 20.
