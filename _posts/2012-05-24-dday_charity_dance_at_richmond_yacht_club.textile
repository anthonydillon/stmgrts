    On June 19 1944, just less than two weeks after D-Day, a V1 'doodlebug' flying bomb landed on Twickenham Embankment at the bottom of Water Lane. It destroyed Gotham Villas, killing six people. A further 4 people on the Embankment were also killed.
    
    To commemorate this and D-Day, a dance will be held at Richmond Yacht club on Friday 8<sup>th</sup> June.  Proceeds from the dance will go towards The Embankment Memorial Fund -a fund established to build a memorial to the event and those who died.

On June 19 1944, just less than two weeks after D-Day, a V1 'doodlebug' flying bomb landed on Twickenham Embankment at the bottom of Water Lane. It destroyed Gotham Villas, killing six people. A further 4 people on the Embankment were also killed.

To commemorate this and D-Day, a dance will be held at Richmond Yacht club on Friday 8<sup>th</sup> June.  Proceeds from the dance will go towards The Embankment Memorial Fund -a fund established to build a memorial to the event and those who died.

A cold buffet will be served and there will be a good selection of drinks at the bar.

The dress code is 1940's (preferably) or smart casual.  There will be interesting prizes for the lady and gentleman wearing the best 1940's outfits so come dressed to impress!

There will be also be a raffle with prizes of essential but hard-to-get 1940's items.  (As these are to be prizes it will not be necessary to bring your ration card.)
