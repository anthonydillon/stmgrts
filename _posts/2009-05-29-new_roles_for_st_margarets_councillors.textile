Cllr Ben Khosa has succeeded Cllr Geoff Acton as Deputy Mayor for the coming year. He intends, as far as possible, to fulfil his public engagement by bicycle.

Geoff Acton has been appointed Cabinet Member for Environment, taking over from Cllr Martin Elengorn [Teddington], who will become his Assistant. His responsibilities include: allotments, building control, cemeteries, commercial environmental health, corporate property, development control (planning), licensing, parks and open spaces, planning policy and design, procurement, recycling, registrar's office, special projects (contaminated land, air pollution), street scene enforcement, sustainability, tourism, trading standards, and waste collection. He's going to be busy!
