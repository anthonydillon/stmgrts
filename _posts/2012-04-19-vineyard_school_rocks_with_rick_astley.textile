Forget cake sales and tombola stalls, Richmond's Vineyard Primary School is taking fundraising to a whole new level by staging its very own music festival, 'The Vineyard Live' on Saturday 19 May.

In the first event of its kind to be held at a school, Eighties pop legend and internet sensation Rick Astley will be headlining in the run up to performing at one of the year's biggest concerts  'The Hit Factory Live' in Hyde Park  in July.

Supporting Rick Astley and his band the Luddites will be the Barnes Blues Band, rockers Lady Bear and 'rock and roll's best kept secret',  Never the Bride. As well as entertaining the crowd with some of the eighties biggest hits, Rick will be performing cover versions of hits by The Arctic Monkeys, The Kings of Leon and T Rex.

The 'Vineyard Live' festival will see the school transformed into a mini Glastonbury with food stalls and bars, with organisers hoping the event will raise more than &pound;20,000.
