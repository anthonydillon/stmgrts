A partnership of local traders, residents and school PTAs are currently planning a community event to be held in Crown Road in September, the exact date is still to be confirmed. The event will be aimed at raising funds for local projects and charities.

Crown Road will be closed to traffic for the day, giving plenty of space for side stalls, arts and crafts, competitions, demonstrations and all sorts of fun and games.

The event would then carry on into the evening with a function held in the St Margarets Tavern.

Proceeds from the day will go to fund local projects and charities.

_Maybe you would like to organise a stall or a competition?_

If you would like to get involved and help fund raise for your chosen charity or project please "email us":mailto:volunteer@stmgrts.org.uk.
