For those who are not aware, the Crown Road Surgery is going to be moving to a new building on the old Brunnel site in August, 2007.  The surgery will be located on St Margarets Road, opposite the Talbot Road junction.  A larger building with better access are sited as the reasons for the move.  

Patients will not have to change registrations as a result of the move.
