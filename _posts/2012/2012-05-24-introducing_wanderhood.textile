    The world loves social networks, but there is a gap, according to local resident Scott Gregory. He has designed "Wanderhood":http://www.wanderhood.com, an online network for a very important community in our lives, our neighbourhood.
    
    Wanderhood aims to build on the great community spirit that already exists in St Margarets. Scott believes that Wanderhood is a tool that can help people to get out and enjoy their local neighbourhood even more, by putting people in touch with who and what's happening in St Margarets.

The world loves social networks, but there is a gap, according to local resident Scott Gregory. He has designed "Wanderhood":http://www.wanderhood.com, an online network for a very important community in our lives, our neighbourhood.

Wanderhood aims to build on the great community spirit that already exists in St Margarets. Scott believes that Wanderhood is a tool that can help people to get out and enjoy their local neighbourhood even more, by putting people in touch with who and what's happening in St Margarets.

To join the site, local residents, workers or people with a connection to St Margarets need to provide their postcode (held privately) and should upload a profile picture.

Members can connect and keep up to date with their neighbours online. They can also join or set up local groups and discussions, view or add events, sell things locally and check out the local weather and news (from the St Margarets community website). The website is also available to use from your smartphone, with an app in the works.

If you live or work locally or have a group or event you wish to add to the site you can register at "www.wanderhood.com.":http://www.wanderhood.com. The site launched this week, so Scott is interested in your "feedback":http://www.wanderhood.com/page/comments-1 so he can continue to improve the site.
