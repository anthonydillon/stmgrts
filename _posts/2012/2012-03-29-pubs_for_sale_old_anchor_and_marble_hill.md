Young & Co Brewery plc, who these days are in truth a pubco that no longer brews any beer, are trying to sell 14 pubs, including the Old Anchor and Marble Hill on Richmond Road. The Old Anchor's asking price is £650,000 for the freehold (but it is let on a 3-year lease until 2014 for £17000 p.a.). Ominously the agents say 'The building occupies a large plot and may be suitable for alternative uses, subject to planning permission.'

The now shut Marble Hill (formerly the Rising Sun) is cheaper at £600,000 with vacant possession. It has had a difficult time since its last proper landlord, Kevin Barker, left in disgust at the greedy rent rises demanded by Young's: as a neighbour, even though I am a pub-goer, I haven't used this one for years: I think its demise would pass unmourned, indeed unnoticed, by one and all.

Also for sale is the Mitre in St Mary's Grove, Richmond, a pub that many residents don't know exists, at one time said to be the haunt of the local criminal fraternity, where a strange face was rarely seen, but now a 'Well-run traditional pub serving the local community in an affluent residential area. There is no
commercial kitchen, so food is limited. Popular music venue.'
