The first images of how Richmond Council will transform the derelict swimming pool on Twickenham Riverside into a new park and public square have been revealed.

An artist's impression and other drawings of the site have been made public by the Council, to show local people how the area will be opened up. The artist's impression shows a grassed area immediately behind Caf√© Sunshine and a park space in front of the old diving board, which will be kept as a memorial to the long struggle to re-open the site. A square section closest to the old changing rooms would be paved to become a public square. The Council hopes this would tie in to plans for the section of the site which currently has buildings on, which will be brought forward after further consultation next year.
