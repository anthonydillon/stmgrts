_Practical advice on keeping you and your home warm, avoiding cold related illness such as flu and eating well in the winter_

Winter isn't everyone's favourite season and there's no doubt that the cold weather can be a worry for some. Cold weather can lead to serious health problems, particularly for people who have a long-term health condition or are over 65. With a little preparation, and by following some simple suggestions, we can help ward off the winter chills.

The Winter Wellbeing Campaign for 2012/13 has been launched to help the residents of the borough of Richmond upon Thames prepare for the colder weather. Age UK Richmond, NHS Richmond and Richmond AID are working in partnership to deliver the local campaign.

The campaign aims to help older and more vulnerable people keep warm and well this winter. Keeping warm both inside and outside your home can help to reduce risk of serious health problems that are more common in the colder months, such as chest infections, flu and pneumonia.


We are on hand to offer advice and guidance on a range of winter wellbeing issues, including:

* Heating homes to the right temperature and finding out what help is available to make homes warmer
* Avoiding cold related illness (such as flu and pneumonia)
* Maximising income to help with fuel bills and keeping warm
* Feeling safe at home
* Eating healthily

When the weather takes a turn for the worse, we all struggle to get out and about but it can be particularly difficult for people who are disabled or in poor health. Sadly, staying at home can be just as problematic, especially if they are struggling to pay their heating bills to warm their homes and have to make choices between daily basics like heating and eating.

Together, we aim to tackle the problems that winter brings and make it easier for thousands of older, more vulnerable people to manage during the colder months.
