There is an exciting new addition to the Art Auction this year.

Local MP, environmentalist, art lover and Patron of the Environment Trust, Zac Goldsmith, has offered Tea for Four at the Houses of Parliament.

So come along and place your bids!

The auction is one of the highlights of the social calendar in Twickenham and last year raised almost £12,000 towards the many environmental projects supported by the Environment Trust for Richmond upon Thames.

The final number of lots is expected to reach around forty. Prices for individual pieces may start from as little as £20 and some may achieve well over £1,500.

Says auctioneer and fine art dealer, John Iddon: "We are, as ever, indebted to our artists who so generously donate their work to help the work of the Trust. Because it is an auction, amazing bargains are to be had on the night - there are some wonderful paintings."
