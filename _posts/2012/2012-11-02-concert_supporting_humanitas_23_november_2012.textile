_An Evening of Flute, Voice and Verse_

I am delighted to invite you to a concert to support a charity "www.humanitascharity.org":http://www.humanitascharity.org which supports children in need.

In 2000, a British A-level student called Sarah Wade visited Romania as an eighteen-year-old volunteer working in a children's orphanage. Horrified, angered and overwhelmed by the conditions and treatment endured by the orphans, she returned to the UK with an unshakable need to do something about it. True to her conscience, in 2001 she returned.

bq. "We believe every child is entitled to health care, an education and a family. We strive to provide children across the globe with these three key rights."

Artists based in St Margarets Lilly Dufter-Wimmer, Moir Leslie, Ester Kosar and Roy Stratford would love to enchant you for an evening with classical music and poetry...
