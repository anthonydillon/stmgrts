Twickenham Film Studios is back on the market after the company that won the bid pulled out for "personal reasons" last week.

Gerald Krasner, of Begbies Traynor, joint administrator of Twickenham Film Studios, said he could not say why the company had pulled out, but he could confirm it was not for financial reasons.

The purchaser had put forward a &pound;100,000 deposit, which it has lost, and Mr Krasner has said the money would be used to help maintain the site as it is.

Mr Krasner was adamant the studios would not be sold for property development, which was previously feared by campaign group, Save Twickenham Film Studios (STFS).
