*Help is at hand to stay tuned in*

Residents in Richmond upon Thames are reminded that their TV reception will switch from analogue to digital in April and anyone not prepared for the switch will be left with a blank screen.

In a drive to make the switchover as a painless as possible, the BBC is running a Help Scheme for vulnerable residents across the country. Under the initiative the BBC will send an accredited engineer to your home to help prepare your set for digital transmission and will provide any extra information you may require.

Cllr Rita Palmer, Champion for Senior Residents said: "I urge residents who are worried about how to switch over to digital to contact the Help Scheme. They are very helpful and will come to your home and quickly and efficiently switch you over to digital."

> "This is not something to worry about as help is at hand, but you shouldn't leave it too late otherwise come April 4, you will not receive any channels."

The switch to digital will take place on 4 April 2012. The support is free for eligible people who are on pension credit, income support, income-based jobseeker's allowance or income-related employment and support allowance. Otherwise the BBC charges Â£40 for the standard option of help. This covers an approved engineer supplying and installing the equipment, easy to use equipment and a 12 month aftercare service including a free helpline.
