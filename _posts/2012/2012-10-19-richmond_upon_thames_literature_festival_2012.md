Now in its' 21<sup>st</sup> year, the [Richmond Literature Festival](https://stmargarets.london/directory/art/200610191449) is a calendar highlight for the borough and beyond. This years' programme features a wide range of authors, commentators and leading figures from politics, journalism, sport, theatre and television, including Andrew Marr, Jack Straw and Prue Leith.

Our programme for young people includes events with Emma Chichester Clark, the legendary Judith Kerr, as well as workshops for young children with Nicholas Allan author of The Queens Knickers, and Eileen Browne's Boo Boo Baby and the Giraffe drawing event.

Many of this years' festival events are set among prestigious heritage locations including galleries, arts centres and universities across the borough.
