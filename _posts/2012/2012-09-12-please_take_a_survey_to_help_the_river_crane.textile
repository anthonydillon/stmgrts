The Crane Valley Partnership is working to create a management plan for River Crane and its surrounding green space. We would really like to get the local community to share their opinions and ideas with us regarding what is important to them in this area through filling out a very short questionnaire.

We would like people who live or work in Harrow, Hillingdon, Ealing, Hounslow and Richmond to help us through spending 5 minutes on this questionnaire. We have a FREE FAMILY TICKET TO THE LONDON WETLAND CENTRE IN BARNES up for grabs in a prize draw that will take place at the end of October.

Would you be kind enough to fill in this questionnaire and forward it on to any of your members, colleagues or friends who live or work in these three boroughs.

Thank you so much for your time!
