*Don't forget the [Jubilee Jazz Festival](https://stmargarets.london/event/concert/200705143211) on 3 and 4 June 2012!*

The long range weather forecast is looking horrible... but don't worry, the performances all take place in a large chandelier lit marquee which has plenty of seating.

On Sunday 3<sup>rd</sup> June Saxophonist Don Weller cannot appear due to ill health but he has been replaced by legendary saxophonist Peter King, who will also have copies of his newly published autobiography.

Our Hospitality Village includes local Ales, chilled strawberry cider, speciality teas and cup cakes, a hog roast & BBQ, vegetarian and vegan Indian food. Also, a 7ft chocolate fountain! All locally sourced from our own local high quality and very individual businesses.

There is also plenty of space to picnic in the beautiful grounds but we ask you not to bring alcohol as there is a festival bar.

#### More Information

-   No Dogs
-   Parking in the House car park is for disabled drivers only but there is plenty of parking in the surrounding streets and we ask everyone to be considerate of the homeowners.
