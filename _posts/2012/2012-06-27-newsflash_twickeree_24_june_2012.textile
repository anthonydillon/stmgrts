    h4. St Margarets Win The Derby!

    Despite the appalling weather and their abysmal sporting record the 1<sup>st</sup> St Margarets Cub Pack won the _Tri-Annual Soap Box Derby_ at the "Twickeree Camp":https://stmargarets.london/archives/2012/06/twickeree_2012.html this weekend in Marble Hill Park. Competing against 14 other Packs the 23 strong squad of boys and girls pushed, panted and propelled their home-made cart through heats, quarter and semi finals and eventually the final itself to victory. The only thing to decide now is who gets to look after the trophy first!
