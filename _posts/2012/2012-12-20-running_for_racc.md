*Fund raising for students with learning difficulties and disabilities at Richmond Adult Community College*

Richmond Adult Community College is one of 360 adult education colleges in the UK but the only one with a specific adult mission that includes comprehensive learner support for students with learning difficulties and disabilities.

As government funding has reduced it has become increasingly difficult to maintain the level of support that these students need and deserve. The answer is to run round Richmond Park.

We are putting together a team of ten people to run in the Richmond Park Marathon on Sunday May 5 with a target to raise £3000 from a mix of individual and team sponsorship. All funds raised going directly to the college LLDD support fund.

It is only £31 to enter which includes an informal but professional structured training schedule and a free 'Running for RACC' T Shirt.

Join the 'Running for RACC' team to raise £3000 for supported learning (LLDD) students.

*There are just six places left.*

#### About the Richmond Park Marathon

[richmondparkmarathon.co.uk](http://richmondparkmarathon.co.uk/)
Now in its third year this is a great run through stunning deer studded scenery and right on our door step.

The hills can be a bit of a challenge but what a great way to get fit!

#### Fund raising for RACC

An independent registered charity The Portcullis Trust (PT 281564) has been raising funds for the college for over thirty years.

If you are interested in joining as a trustee or being involved in any way do please contact us.
