_Farewell to the Marble Hill! Hello to The Aleksander!_

The new owners of the Marble Hill pub are "throwing a party on the 2 October 2012 from 4 to 11 pm":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/event/party/200705143620 to celebrate the renaming of the pub after their son Aleksander. It's his birthday  too!

And they'll be showcasing their new kitchen, complete with wood-fired pizza oven and a genuine Neapolitan chef, Francesco.

And there will be food and drink samples to try for free.

And as if that wasn't enough, they have a great range of craft beers, so you can enjoy your very own comparative tasting.

See you there!
