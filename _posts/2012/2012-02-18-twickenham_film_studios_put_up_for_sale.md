Twickenham Film Studios is being sold one year before its centenary.

A current freelance worker at the studios, where films including Alfie and the Italian Job were produced, said staff had to leave the premises by July.

Future projects already booked there will be moved to other venues, such as Pinewood Studios.

The source, who asked to remain anonymous, said selling the studios to property developers was the "easiest option" for the current owners.
