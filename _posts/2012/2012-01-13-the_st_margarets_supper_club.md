Are you a single 38 to 48 something (give or take a few years) and sometimes feel you have lots of friends all over place but just no one local, or maybe you're so busy you don't really have many friends at all. Maybe you're fed up with your old friends and just fancy meeting some new people, either for socialising or networking. Either way, if you live in the St Margarets area and would like socialising on your doorstep, read on....Local female resident, is thinking about setting up a St Margarets supper club. It can be as fancy or as casual as you like, dinner parties around someone's house, bring a dish parties, order in a take away or simply a night out in a local restaurant.
