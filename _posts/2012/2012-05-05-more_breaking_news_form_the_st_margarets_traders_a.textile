*It is with great regret we announce that the famous St Margarets Diamond has gone missing!*

_The story so far..._

The famous and very valuable St Margarets Diamond was recently re-discovered in St Margarets after being lost for centuries. The diamond went on display for all to admire but unfortunately has gone missing again!

International diamond thief - Dia Monte has been seen in the area and Inspector Bright-Spark of the Yard has deduced that Dia Monte has stolen the diamond and hidden it somewhere in St Margarets. How does Inspector Bright Spark know this? Because a shopping list belonging to Dia Monte was found near to where the diamond was stolen.

Can you help Inspector Bright-Spark solve the clues and recover the diamond? Our friends at Churchills Estate Agents are offering a reward prize of a family break to a fun packed theme park to the lucky junior detective who solves the mystery. Clue sheets and entry forms are available from Churchills offices in St Margarets Road.
