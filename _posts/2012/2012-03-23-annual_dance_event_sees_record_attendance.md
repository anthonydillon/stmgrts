Over 400 residents flocked to this year's Richdance Festival held at Hampton School last weekend, making it the most attended dance event in the borough.

The two day festival, now in it's 10<sup>th</sup> year, showcased the talents of over 27 dance and youth groups from across the borough and beyond with a diverse range of dance styles, including street, contemporary, jazz, tap and ballet. Sunday's programme ended with a performance choreographed by professional choreographer Cathy Waller, this years' recipient of the Blueprint Bursary Award.

Cllr Pamela Fleming, Cabinet Member for Communities, Business and Culture at Richmond Council, said:

> "This weekend's Richdance festival showcased and celebrated dance in the Borough. We saw a packed theatre full of residents which speaks highly of the talent and variety of performances. The borough has an exceptional passion for the arts which is growing every year and I am pleased once again that we have provided a stage for them."

This annual celebration of dance provides aspiring dancers with a platform to perform in a professional setting. This year participants were also able to take part in a street dance workshop run by professional dancers and also given the opportunity to learn some of the choreography for the Big Dance 2012 Schools Pledge.
