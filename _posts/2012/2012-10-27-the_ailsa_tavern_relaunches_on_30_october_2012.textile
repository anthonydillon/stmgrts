h4. Food

We've created a brand new menu with our new head chef. We're combining traditional pub fare (steak and Guinness pie, rack of ribs, fish and chips etc.) with a few posher dishes (venison loin or beetroot, pine nut and goats cheese salad etc.) but making sure we're a pub that sells good food as opposed to a restaurant with a bar attached. It's important to us that we remain a traditional community pub and distance ourselves from the gastro or pub chain image.

We're offering a range of meals for &pound;5 at lunchtimes, as well as offers on coffee and cake and a free kids meal with every adult meal purchased in order to get some of the mums in the area in during the day. We're massively accommodating to families and children, and it'd be great to see more of them in during the daytimes.

h4. Music

We already have a band in the pub every Saturday from 9pm and the live music crowd is steadily growing. In addition to this, we're adding a few new weekly events.

On Thursday nights we're having Irish and Scottish Folk music - a group of musicians are going to set up in the pub, unamplified, and will play traditional instruments between 8pm and 11pm with different guests each week (first night Thu 8<sup>th</sup> Nov), with additional performers welcome to join in and paid with a free pint of beer!

On Sundays between 4pm and 6pm we're going to have a different jazz quartet every week. A fantastic trumpeter called Evan Clegg is going to run the session and invite a different three performers to join him each time. Hopefully this will be a great accompaniment to the tail end of our Sunday roast trade, where people can come and be entertained without worrying about being home late due to children or work. Starts November 4<sup>th</sup>.

We will also have two open mic nights a month, on the second and last weeks. These have already proved very popular and are run by Elaine Samuels, a musician who has just started a national campaign to support live music in pubs ("www.elainesamuels.co.uk/OpenMicNights.htm":http://www.elainesamuels.co.uk/OpenMicNights.htm). We get a range of standards, from very talented up-and-coming or established acts all the way to very cheesy novelty performances - it never fails to entertain!
