l am also still looking for businesses who may be interested in donating to the event looking for everything and anything really that we can auction! Of course we will be sure to thank businesses who have donated on the evening ensuring everyone knows they have supported the event.

This event will raise money for Voluntary Services Overseas (VSO reg charity number 313757). VSO tackles poverty in developing countries by empowering those most affected by it. Volunteers from the UK and host countries work together on projects such as education and maternal health which provide sustainable, long lasting change.

I will be volunteering with them in February. My place is already funded so all the money raised on the evening will go directly towards future projects. If you would like to find out more about the amazing work VSO do visit [www.vso.org.uk](http://www.vso.org.uk)
