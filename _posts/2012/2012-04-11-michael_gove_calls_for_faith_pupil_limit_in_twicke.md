Education Secretary Michael Gove has suggested a proposed new Catholic school should limit Catholic pupils to 50% of its intake.

Business Secretary Vince Cable wrote to Mr Gove about the proposed school, which is in his Twickenham constituency.

Mr Gove said the proposal for a cap was "very sensible".

But a Catholic Education Service official said turning Catholics away and admitting others just because they were not Catholic would be "odd".
