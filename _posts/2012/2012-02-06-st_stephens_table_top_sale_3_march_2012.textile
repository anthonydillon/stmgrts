It's the perfect time for a good Spring clean, so why not clear out all those unwanted clothes, bikes, toys and household goods... they may be just what someone else is looking for... and could earn you some extra
cash.

Tea, coffee, cold drinks and snacks will be on sale. Money raised from the sale of spaces and refreshments will go towards a Smarter St Stephen's campaign to refurbish the school hall. Additional  donations always gratefully received.
