On [Sunday, 22 July 2012](/event/fair/200705143443) the Rugby Football Union presents the annual Strawberry Hill Music & Family Fun Day in the grounds of the gothic house on Waldegrave Road, Twickenham. Over 7,000 attended last year.

As well as providing the community with a fun day out, the aim is to raise funds for the restoration of Strawberry Hill House.

Once again there will be the popular live music stage, charity and craft stalls, children's rides and entertainment, beer and Pimms tents, food and refreshments. Why not bring a picnic and enjoy the day.

From 12noon until 7.30pm the music stage will feature bands, mostly with a local connection:

-   Skalextric
-   The Mustangs
-   The Blue Meanies
-   Nark Drool & The Shudders
-   Marner Brown

... and others.
