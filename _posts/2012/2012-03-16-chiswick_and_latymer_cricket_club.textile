    _New Colts Section_
    
    Despite our name our headquarters are in Wills Crescent on the Whitton and Hounslow border from where we run 4 adult teams on Saturdays and a further 2 teams on Sundays. We are now starting a colts section for ages 7 upwards that will be supervised by ECB qualified coaches who have all been CRB checked.
    
    The first colts coaching session will be on Sunday 1 April from 10 until midday and will run every Sunday morning through the summer.
    
    No need to book - just turn up - and we look forward to meeting you.
