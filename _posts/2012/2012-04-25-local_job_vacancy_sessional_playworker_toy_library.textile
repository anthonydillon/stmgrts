The Toy library has an extensive catalogue which includes baby toys, construction toys, dressing up, role play, books, sensory toys and more.

Borrowing rather than buying toys is a green way of introducing children to new experiences, helping to shrink families' carbon footprint. It is also an easier way for children to experience new toys without the expense. Our toy library currently holds sessions at 6 Children's Centre's and is continuing to grow.

Marble Hill Playcentres is looking for a Sessional Playworker, who is passionate about Play, to work at our Toy library.
