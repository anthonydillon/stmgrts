    Thank you for the ever continuing support for the St Margarets Fair.  After a damp and boggy start to the day, the weather came to its senses and for the 34<sup>th</sup> year the Fair was once again St Margarets largest community event.  We really appreciate the help and support we get from residents and their friends, and especially the very local residents who are invaded on mass for a Saturday every July.  We'll let you know shortly how much money will be going to the local schools and charities, but in the meantime it would be really useful if you could find a few minutes to complete a survey that will help us in our planning for next year's Fair.
