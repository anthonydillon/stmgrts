Super-jumbos could be allowed to land at Heathrow for more than 20 hours a day under plans being considered by ministers.

Emirates Airline hopes to bypass restrictions on night flights by landing its A380 airbuses -- the world's largest passenger airliners -- at steeper angles to protect homes from jet-engine noise. The airline wants permission to fly in and out until 1am every day, restarting flights after 4am.
