Over 60 local residents joined the Mayor of the Borough, Cllr Clare Head as she celebrated St Patrick's Day in Twickenham last Saturday.

The event, which raised &pound;1,000 for the Mayor's charity Richmond Citizens Advice Bureau (RCABS), saw live Irish music and traditional dancing by former Riverdance star Dermot Cullen and was also attended by the Mayor of Ealing and the Deputy Mayors of Croydon and Barnet.



Cllr Clare Head, the Mayor of Richmond upon Thames said:

bq.. "The atmosphere was full of cheer and rich Irish culture. As well as the Irish fiddle we enjoyed a brilliant performance led by Dermot Cullen and a traditional sit down dinner.

The ultimate success was the money raised for The Citizens Advice Bureau - an extremely deserving charity."
