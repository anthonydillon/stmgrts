_St Margarets local, Bob Howard has won the prestigious BIBA Journalist of the Year award._

<div class="letter">

The British Insurance Brokers' Association (BIBA), the UK's leading general insurance intermediary organisation, has named Bob Howard from BBC Radio Moneybox as the "BIBA Journalist of the Year":http://www.biba.org.uk/MediaCenterContentDetails.aspx?ContentID=3036.

The awards showcase journalists who have used their work to further the understanding of what can often be highly complex insurance issues.

Eric Galbraith, BIBA Chief Executive said: 

bq.. "We are now in our 30th year of the awards, and every year we have seen the entries grow in strength. I believe that this year's short-listed journalists represent the strongest group that we have ever had the pleasure to work with.

"As well as looking at the originality and style of writing, and the quality of related research or investigatory work, our independent judges have been asked to identify the journalists that raised awareness of general insurance subjects through their work and provided an insight into general insurance issues.

"I commend all those short-listed for providing a valuable service to the British consumer and the insurance sector, and would like to congratulate the winners on their fantastic and well deserved achievement."
