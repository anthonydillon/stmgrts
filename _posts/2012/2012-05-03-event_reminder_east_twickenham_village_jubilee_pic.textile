"Monday 4 June 2012 - from noon to 3pm":http://stmargarets.london/event/fair/200705143341

Celebrate the Jubilee with an old-fashioned picnic in Cambridge Gardens, our local riverside park. Bring your own food and drink, or buy snacks and drinks at Rachel's Caf&#233;. They will be doing a barbecue too. There'll be a beer and wine tent, provided by Real Ale. And we're expecting Queen Elizabeth I to make an appearance and a short speech. There will be flags to wave and crowns and tiaras for everyone. So come along and bring your neighbours!
