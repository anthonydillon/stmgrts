The January 26 Council Cabinet meeting decided to go ahead with the 'Expansion Of Orleans Infant And Nursery School And St Stephen's Church Of England Junior School'.

> '... The proposals are that, in September 2012, Orleans Infant would be converted from a three-form entry infant school to a two-form entry primary and St Stephen's Junior would be converted from a three-form entry junior to a two- form entry primary. Both schools would therefore provide statutory education of children in all year-groups from Reception to Year 6 inclusive. The proposals would create:
> 
>  \* a fourth Reception class across the two schools and a seventh within the local area, enabling an extra 30 children to be admitted into Reception each year;
>  \* a third school - St Stephen's - with a reception intake in the area; and
>  \* a third geographical entry-point for Reception in the area . . '
> 
 The responses include one from the governors of Governing Body of Orleans Infants setting out their position in detail.
