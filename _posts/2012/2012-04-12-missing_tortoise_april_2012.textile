I was hoping that someone could help me finding my missing tortoise!

He goes by the name of Basil, not that that will be of much help, but he is greatly missed. It may be the case that he is taking a very long hibernation, but we have concerns that he may have escaped from his garden in South Western Road and been picked up by someone. Even if someone has had him for several weeks they will be thanked for looking after him, but we would very much like to have him back. Tortoises need to have special care.

Small reward for anyone who finds him. He is a Hermans Tortoise, about 12 years old and would probably be about the same size as an adult male's hand.

Please contact the website "here":mailto:editor@stmgrts.org.uk if you have any information, or Basil himself.
