Eddie comments:

> I've been in the Sushi business for years, I used to be the head chef at YO! Sushi in its very early days. I've been selling sushi at the Crown road fairs for several years now and so know how popular fresh sushi is in St Margarets. All of the sushi is hand made fresh at the stall, we use the finest Scottish salmon and only responsibly fished yellow fin tuna. We will have a full range of sushi so you can pick individual items or pick up ready to go lunch boxes from £5.00 we also do event catering and can deliver party platters. I'm looking forward to serving you sushi -- this Saturday and every Saturday in St Margarets. Please come and have a look.

Eddie's stall is fully licensed by Richmond council. The St Margarets Traders Association have been working with Eddie and Richmond council to introduce this initiative to St Margarets. We are also hoping to expand the offer to include fresh fish.
