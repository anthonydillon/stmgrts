Local charity Richmond AID's gardening project for disabled residents is set to receive Â£5,000 as part of Richmond Council's Civic Pride Grant fund.

The volunteer-run Richmond SPADE provides a tailored gardening service for elderly or disabled residents in the borough. Local volunteers utilise their skills to tidy, prune and clean gardens so that they are safe, accessible and can be enjoyed by their owner. This funding will go towards the continued running costs of the programme and help with the purchasing and maintaining equipment and gardening tools.

Cllr Pamela Fleming, Richmond Council's Strategic Cabinet Member for Community, Business and Culture said:

> "Civic Pride is all about enhancing the local area by creating places for people to enjoy and be proud of. SPADE is a great example of a local community service where volunteers are able to use their talents and hobbies to help create beautiful safe places for the enjoyment of others. This grant will help to give the project the boost it needs to continue providing such a valued service in the borough."

Alex Brining, Operations Manager at Richmond AID added: "The Civic Pride fund will allow us to maintain and develop this project with our dedicated teams of volunteer gardeners and a Coordinator. There are many people who would benefit from help to keep this borough in bloom and we are so happy to receive this grant to carry on our work to ensure as many people as possible can be proud of their borough."
