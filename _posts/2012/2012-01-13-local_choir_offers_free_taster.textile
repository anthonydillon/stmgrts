If you are one of the many who have relished the particular thrill of communal singing at Christmas carol services and concerts in recent weeks, why not make it a weekly pleasure by joining a choir?

Local choir 'Vocality' has just moved to St Margarets and extends a warm welcome to beginner and experienced singers for its new term, commencing this week at St Mary's Junior School.

Vocality's unusual repertoire of harmony songs from around the world, combined with a fun and accessible no-sheet-music approach, makes rehearsals a weekly highlight for many of its members of all ages.

Songs from a wide range of traditions - jazz, folk, spiritual, popular music and others - are selected for their uplifting qualities, and provide a welcome boost to the spirits on a winter's evening.

Rehearsals are on Tuesdays 8.00-10.00pm at St Mary's School on Richmond Road. A free taster session is on offer to anyone wishing to try it out. Please visit "www.vocalitysinging.co.uk":http://www.vocalitysinging.co.uk for more details and to book a taster session.
