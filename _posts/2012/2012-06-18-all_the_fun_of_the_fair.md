    The <a href="http://www.mystmargarets.com/">St Margarets Traders Association</a> recently hosted a Jubilee themed fair. The fair was sponsored by the RFU and local traders.

    Thousands flocked to crown road to soak up the fantastic atmosphere and enjoy the Jubilee. Bands played all day, a variety of entertainers entertained the crowds but perhaps the days highlight was the Jubilee tea party. The party helped raise funds for local charity - Jonny's Journey.
