_St Margarets is open for business_

St Margarets boosts a unique high street bursting with independent specialist shops offering a wide and varied range of goods, services and places to eat.

Over the past few weeks many new businesses have opened and many existing businesses have been refurbished. Recent additions include:

h4. Crown Cycles

_47b Crown Road_

Crown Cycles is an independent bike shop located in the heart of St Margarets village. We sell bikes and are experienced at working on a wide range of cycles from children's to commuter, hybrid, mountain and road bikes. The shop boasts a comprehensive workshop including all the latest equipment and trained and accredited technicians for all your cycling repair and servicing needs. Our passion is bicycles and our vision is to provide a knowledgeable, jargon free value for money service to our customers.



h4. Brula Pantry

_46 Crown Road_

Branching out from our Parisien restaurant, The Brula Pantry brings a range of different culinary delights for you to enjoy in-house or on-the-go.  Food to Go, Light Mains and Small Plates, Refreshments and our Outside Catering Department... With our Outside Catering and Private Dining Room business growing each day the Brula Pantry will enable us to host meetings with guests when organising events, show case the types and style of dishes we do and afford us the room we need to cater for large parties.

h4. La Boulangerie

You will find "Good Life" at La Boulangerie, a French family - run business stocked with simple, honest foods full of unforgettable taste.  From your daily baguette to gastronomic delights, La Boulangerie products are freshly made every day according to French handmade recipes by master bakers using natural ingredients -- unbleached French flour, French butter, the finest chocolate, and no artificial additives, flavourings, colourings or preservatives. We never compromise on quality, which is why we spend 3 days preparing every croissant!  Mangez du pain, Vous vivrez bien

h4. Chase Buchanan Lettings

_155 St Margarets Road_

Chase Buchanan have successfully purchased the Churchills sales office at 155 St Margarets Road. Michael Peacock, Sales Director of Chase Buchanan said "This was great timing for us, as we have been running out of space in our current branch opposite the station. Our plan is to just run Sales from our existing office at 124 St Margarets Road and re-site Lettings to the new office on the corner of Bridge Road. Creating a lot more room will allow us to increase our staff-base within both sales and lettings and hopefully assist even more people with their move, whilst continuing to provide the best level of service available locally."

h4. Thorougoods

_40 Crown Road_

The former Look-In Video store has been transformed into Thorougoods, still offering the latest DVD's to rent, key cutting and Ink cartridges but now boasts a wide and varied range of wines, beers and spirits. Wines to suit all tastes and pockets!

h4. The Turks Head pub

_28 Winchester Road_

A popular meeting place for fans of the oval ball, The Turk's Head pub in Twickenham lies conveniently between St Margarets train station and the home of rugby. Electric on a matchday, the pub enjoys a more relaxed atmosphere in the week - great for a quiet pint. The pub has recently undergone a refurbishment opening up the Winchester Hall to make more space in the bar when required. The pub now offers a new and extensive menu.

h4. Ches's Trattoria

_48 Crown Road_

A caf&#233; by day serving hearty breakfasts and lunches, the place is transformed in to the Trattoria in the evening. The restaurant is not licensed so you are cordially invited to bring your own alcohol. Our recent refurbishment allows us to offer more dining space but we still advise you to book to avoid disappointment.

_91 Crown Road_

The Vet in St Margarets provides veterinary excellence to pets and their owners in the community and local surrounding areas of Twickenham, Isleworth, Richmond and Teddington.
