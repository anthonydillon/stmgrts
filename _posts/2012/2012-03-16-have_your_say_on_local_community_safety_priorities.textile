Residents in Richmond upon Thames are being invited to discuss community safety issues with the Borough Commander, Clive Chalk, and Richmond Council's Chief Executive, Gillian Norton, at an open forum event at York House, Twickenham on Tuesday, 20 March 2012.

The event, called 'Face the People', is run by the Borough's Community Safety Partnership  It will review performance and actions that have been taken on community safety, policing and other local issues over the last year, and will provide an opportunity for residents to get involved and shape the priorities for the Community Safety Partnership Plan for the next year.





Cllr Pamela Fleming, Strategic Cabinet Member for Communities, Business and Culture on Richmond Council, said:  "Through the All in One consultation last year, we found out that over a third of residents said that low levels of crime and anti-social behaviour made their area a great place to live, residents generally felt safe in their local community and we want to keep it this way.

bq. "I would like to encourage local people to come to this event for a chance to tell us the community safety and policing issues that they think should be prioritised in the borough. We know that crime levels are typically low in Richmond upon Thames, but we want to look at what more can be done to improve safety even further."

The event runs from 7 to 8pm in the Hyde Room at York House, Twickenham. For more information contact the CPP administrator on "community.safety@richmond.gov.uk":mailto:community.safety@richmond.gov.uk or on 020 8891 7777.
