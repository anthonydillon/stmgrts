    We have a son who is very, very interested in Pokemon... but all the leagues are pretty far away. Are there any interested people out in Richmond Borough? Perhaps we could set up a casual, regular game?
    
    If so, please email: "pokemon@stmargarets.london":mailto:pokemon@stmargarets.london
