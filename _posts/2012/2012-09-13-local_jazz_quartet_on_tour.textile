The St Margarets based "Julian Costello Quartet":http://www.juliancostello.co.uk plays contemporary music that incorporates a range of different grooves, moods and colours, its textures both tuneful and melodic. Some of the tunes are really structured and scored while others are more free-flowing and left to chance. Playing tenor and soprano saxophones and composing all the music. Julian sees the group as his heritage to 'jam'; improvise and see what happens. The rest of the quartet feature very much as equals rather than as accompanists, and Julian tries to think of his solos as conversations with the rest of the group rather than traditional solos with rhythmic and harmonic accompaniment. To date the group has released a number of recordings, their most recent being Edge of Distinction and Cake and Consequences.

bq. "Costello is an extremely moody player on both saxophones and his compositions cover many musical areas...an emotive and soulful tenor player"
??Jazzwise magazine??

bq. "Delicate and melodic... saxophone led original material with nods to Jan Garbarek and Ralph Towner"
??Time Out??

bq. "Brilliant music... I am very impressed"
??Gilad Atzmon??
