It's that time of the year again! Twickenham Farmers' Market holds its annual Spring Plant Fair this Saturday - 14 April 2012!

We have some great nurseries attending this year - let's hope we can squeeze them all in!

We have Hampshire herbs from Stockbridge Herbs, Surrey herbs from the Culinary Herb Company, and fantastic-looking perennials from Pioneer Plants. For beautiful bulbs go to Rose Cottage Plants from Essex, or pay a visit to Ab of Beauchamp Nurseries, another South London growing business. Edible Ornamentals will be bringing their broad range of edible plants (with a string emphasis on chillies), and Test Valley Nursery will have an interesting mix of rare specialist plants alongside traditional "cottage garden" varieties. Market regulars Perry Court Farm will be bringing an extra range of fruit and veg seedling plants from their farm in Kent.

We have no doubt Twickenham will be looking a much brighter, more vibrant place in the days and weeks to come.

Enjoy the market and plant fair on Saturday,

<em>Twickenham Farmers' Market - every Saturday 9am to 1pm in "Holly Road car park":http://g.co/maps/wg4wq</em>
