Make a note in your diary, on [Sunday, April 22<sup>nd</sup>](/event/event/200705143286) a selection of gardens in Petersham will be open to the public. The event is being held to raise money for the Petersham Environmental Trust, a charitable trust whose aim is to help fund environmental causes in and around Petersham. This year over 10 gardens will be included in the ticket price of Â£10 per adult and for children under 16 entry is free. Gardens will be open from 11am to 6pm, with last ticket sales at 5pm.

This year the gardens are open earlier in the year than in previous times to enjoy viewing early spring displays of flowers and foliage. There will be a wealth of variety, size and style to enjoy; with gardens ranging from the grand and ornate to simple, cottage gardens.

The privately owned gardens are all within a ten minute walk from the Petersham Gate entrance to Richmond Park, opposite the Dysart Arms. Buses 65 and 371 from Richmond station serve. Directions to the gardens will be displayed throughout the village, and a simple map is included in your programme.
