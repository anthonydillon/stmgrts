I'm a 15 year old seeking babysitting and childminding jobs. I study at Orleans Park School and I am responsible, mature and reliable. I love working with kids and I can also work at short notice. I am happy to pick children up from Orleans Primary School or St Stephan's CE Primary School on Tuesdays through Fridays and bring them home. I can also do evening and weekend babysitting in the St Margarets area. 

Please don't hesitate to contact me with further questions or queries on 07564440158 

Thank you. Charlotte.
