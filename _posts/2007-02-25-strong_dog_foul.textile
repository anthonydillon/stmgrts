    The Council will be adopting new dog fouling powers that will increase the maximum penalty for failing to remove dog faeces deposited on the highway to &pound;1000 on conviction. The Council will be targeting its enforcement operations at known hotspots in the vicinity of Primary schools.
    
    New signage and publicity in the local newspapers will advertise this new power in the next couple of months. Leaflets will also be handed out to dog walkers and local residents in the vicinity of targeted enforcement areas. The Council will be offering those actually caught in the act of failing to remove faeces the opportunity of paying a fixed penalty notice of &pound;80. If the notice is not paid, legal proceedings will be issued. Such operations will be dependent on Council resources and the level of Police support that can be made available.
