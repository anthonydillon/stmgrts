h2. BACKGROUND

h3. Tell us about your education?

My BA was in French, Modern Greek and Social and Political Science at Cambridge University, I then studied law at Guildford College of Law. After a long gap I returned to university and completed my MA in Human Rights at Kingston University last year.


h3. What are three jobs you have held?

# Counter-Trafficking Team at the Helen Bamber Foundation.
# Office manager at the Royal Ballet School in Richmond Park.
# Legal researcher and editor at Chambers & Partners.
# Can I squeeze in a fourth? Founder of Richmond Freecycle, an online community which lets people give away unwanted items to keep them out of landfill.

h3. What are you links to the Twickenham community?

I've lived in the area for 20 years, my 3 children were all born at Kingston Hospital, I cannot imagine living anywhere else. I have done voluntary work for local community groups including SPEAR, Oxfam, Richmond Allotment Holders Association and the National Childbirth Trust, and find that there is always something interesting happening in the area.

h2. YOUR VIEWS

h3. Why did/do you want to be an MP?

I want to be an MP so that I can support Twickenham residents by promoting Green Party policies. Political life has been devalued with expenses scandals, illegal wars and tax dodging problems, and I feel it's time for a fresh approach.

h3. What do you think are the top three issues for Twickenham and what do you should be done about them?

Traffic congestion makes it hard to move around easily by bicycle or on foot. I would make public transport more affordable and support a 20mph speed limit on roads where people live and work if they request it.

The siting of Turing House free school remains a problem, it is for Teddington children but the proposed location in Whitton would create difficult journeys. I would argue for local authority control over such decisions so that communities can have more say about it.

Local businesses have suffered since the recession. We propose reduced taxes on small business to encourage local enterprise, together with a living wage for all staff.

h3. What do you think are the top three issues are for the Country?

# Inequality has grown since 2010, and the austerity cuts have been a political choice. I would fight to ensure that everybody has decent wages, secure housing and access to appropriate health and social care. We are the sixth richest nation in the world and can afford to care for our most vulnerable people.
# Housing is too expensive and there is not enough stock. We would build more social housing and also license landlords and introduce more protections for tenants.
# Climate change is a real problem, I support a move toward renewable energy. We are an island with amazing wind and tidal energy sources, and if Germany can switch to renewables we can also.

h3. Are there any big things you are looking to achieve or change as an MP?

I would be proud to promote a society which works for the common good while living within the resources of our precious planet. As I work in human rights, I would like to see respect for international laws and more support for UN peacekeeping initiatives in conflict zones.

h3. If elected, how will you keep in-touch with your constituents?

I would have regular open surgeries and also be available via email or phone calls.

h3. What lasting impression would you like to leave for readers

I know and love Twickenham and its people. I am a new candidate offering fresh ideas and the vision of a clear political alternative. Our policies are joined up sensibly to reduce inequality and promote wellbeing. We support decent wages and job security, fair rents, affordable public transport and free university education. I also have the experience and knowhow of a serious contender. Voters need both.

h2. FUN

h3. What is your favourite musical group/band/album?

Pink Floyd The Wall.

h3. What is your favourite book?

"Marjane Satrapi - Persepolis":http://www.amazon.co.uk/Persepolis-Marjane-Satrapi/dp/009952399X

Pasta with anything.

h3. What is your favourite place to take a holiday?

Greece - my father's from Athens, and I don't get there as often as I'd like.
