We finally received a picture of the winner of the _St Margarets Autumn Event_ Dog Show, Molly with her sisters; Imogen, Georgie and Cicely Green (click for a larger photo).

Molly was born and raised in St Margarets and is a Lakeland Terrier.  Some trivia, the winner of the _Scruffiest Dog Contest_ was Molly's brother.
