Children's workshops, art demonstrations, exhibition and music are all included at 'the little draw', a fun family art day taking place at Turner's House on Sunday 12 July, with a programme of events from 12 noon to 6pm.

This is rare opportunity to be creative in the very house that England's much-revered landscape painter, JMW Turner, designed as his country retreat and from where he sketched along the River Thames.



It promises to be a thoroughly enjoyable fun day for families to be creative together. A free event (donations welcome), materials will be provided, with thanks to donations from Cass Art, Kingston upon Thames. Everyone will benefit from artistic hints and tips from London artists, Chiara Conway, Beverley Waller and Jim Woodman.

Workshops for children aged 5 years plus will be held at 1pm, 2.30pm and 4pm. Children should be accompanied by an adult who will be encouraged to participate, too. There is no need to book, but places will be allocated on a first come first served basis.

Between workshops the artists will be drawing and Chiara Conway making music. You can enjoy home-baked cakes and soft drinks throughout the afternoon.
