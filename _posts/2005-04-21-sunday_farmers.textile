The St. Margaret's Traders Association and the St. Margaret's Tavern have submitted an application to the council to hold a small Sunday market in the pub car park on an ongoing basis. If council permission is received potential stalls could include organic meats, fishmonger and produce from local farmers.

Stay tuned for more information.

In order to make the market a success, let us know what kind of vendors you are most interested in seeing by "taking part in our poll":http://stmgrts.org.uk/cgi-bin/poll.cgi?pollname=farmmkt.
