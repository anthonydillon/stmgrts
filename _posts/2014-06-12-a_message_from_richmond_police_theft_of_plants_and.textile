Just to make you all aware we have had a significant increase in the theft of plants, trees and shrubs from residents front gardens
 
Most of these items are very heavy and would require transport to remove them and the majority of alleged thefts are being carried out overnight  
 
The nice weather is encouraging us all into our gardens but the downside is it also encourages thieves...
 
Please can you be extra vigilant and also wherever possible property mark your pots as you would do with valuable property inside your house as you never know if we stop vans with plants and pots in them we can restore them very quickly with a postcode or address on them and arrest the suspect's) immediately
