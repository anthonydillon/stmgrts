Twickenham Ultimate is a small, mixed group of locals that gets together every Monday and Thursday evenings at 7pm for a game of Ultimate Frisbee in Marble Hill Park, Twickenham.

Ultimate Frisbee is a fast-paced team sport and is a great way to build fitness and agility. If you've played Ultimate before, or are relatively fit and want to try, come down and get involved! It's free and informal.

We play at the bottom corner close to the swings and below the Coach House cafe. See you there or email "zephking@btinternet.com":mailto:zephking@btinternet.com to join the mailing list.
