    In the past year St Margarets has raised &pound;17,000 for FRODO, the UK charity working with disabled children in Romania.  It has been an amazing effort and we would like to say thank you to all those who have made and bought the cakes, run, cycled the race and taken part in the great St Margarets Wardrobe sale.  We are in the last lap, just &pound;8,000 to go to complete the target of &pound;25,000 which will pay for a team of doctors from the UK to diagnose and treat 60-70 disabled children over a two week medical mission.
    
    The next event is the "London Duathlon":http://www.thelondonduathlon.com, a team from St Margarets is taking part and we would welcome your support both in giving any sponsorship you can and also joining us on the day.  The Duathlon takes place in "Richmond Park , on Sunday 13<sup>th</sup> September":http://stmgrts.org.uk/event/match/200705142211, the park is specially closed for the day and is a great occasion for all the family.
    
    To sponsor the our team visit "www.justgiving.com/feet-for-frodo/":http://www.justgiving.com/feet-for-frodo/   or, to find out more about FRODO and how St Margarets is supporting it  visit "www.frodokids.org":http://www.frodokids.org/.
