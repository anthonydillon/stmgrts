Dear Resident

We will be carrying out a planned shutdown of the odour control unit for the new inlet and primary settlement tanks on Monday 2 and Tuesday 3 September, for around six hours each day, to replace faulty valves inside.

Without the fans running the majority of the air should stay contained within these covered processes, however, we apologise for any odour noticed as a result of this essential work.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Regards,
...
 Thames Water Customer Services - Mogden Line (24hr/day): 0845 641 0030
