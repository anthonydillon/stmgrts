Richmond Council has started issuing parking tickets using the CCTV camera installed on the corner St Margarets Road and Amyand Road.  We have had reports of a number of people parking in the loading bays outside Tesco having already received tickets.  

The good news is that there is finally some enforcement of the parking rules, bad news as the Council hasn't made it very clear to people that this is now happening in an effort to prevent people from using the loading bay.
