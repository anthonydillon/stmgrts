Richmond Council's Parks and Open Spaces have started a trial of _FitPoint_, a  piece of fitness equipment in Moormead Park.  FitPoint is designed for both young and old to test their strength and exercise their bodies.  The unit consists of a rowing machine, twisting disc, bench lift, push-up, pull-up and step-up.  


This is a temporary installation and is part of a roaming project within the Borough's Parks and Open Spaces. The Fitpoint has been in Kneller Gardens, Meadway, Twickenham for the past 6 weeks where it was well received.

The Council would like feedback on the _FitPoint_ to assess whether it would be a popular addition to the park, so if you have an opinion, call 020 8487 5243.
