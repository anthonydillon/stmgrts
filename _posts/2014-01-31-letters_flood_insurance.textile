<div class="letter">

Trying to sort out renewal of my home insurance I've had a quote higher than ever before - just over &pound;800 for this year.

The insurer - Home Protect - says "your policy has been invited on a scheme which uses the latest flood mapping information and this has highlighted that your home may be at risk of flooding.  As a result the excess for Flooding has been increased to &pound;10,000 & Subsidence, Landslip & Heave to &pound;5,000".

The mention of subsidence, landslip & heave refers to a claim made in 2004 relating to a drain crash.

I would like to know if any of our neighbours have had their insurance premiums increased in light of the 'latest flood mapping information'

many thanks

Gail Rooke
