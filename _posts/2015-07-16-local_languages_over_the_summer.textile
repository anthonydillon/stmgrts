Prepare for your holiday, or pretend you're already there, by joining me (Adrienne at Live Languages) for private or small group lessons in French, German or Spanish.

I do bespoke languages tutoring from primary through to degree level. Adults, children, individuals and groups are all warmly welcomed, and I am available to travel to offices or schools if there is enough interest.

Join Adrienne, bilingual Oxford graduate, for fun, friendly and relaxed French conversation in a small adults' group.  There are a couple of new spaces available on weekday mornings so please call or email for more information.

_Strictly limited places - contact Adrienne ASAP_
