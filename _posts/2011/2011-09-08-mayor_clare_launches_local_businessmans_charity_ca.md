    Richmond Mayor Councillor Clare Head visited St Margarets recently to help launch, local trader Jason Payne's campaign to raise funds for Cancer Research UK.
    
    Jason who runs Crown Classic Cars in Crown Road St Margarets is planning to trek the 5895 metres to the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro in March next year.
    
    Jason's trek will take him through four eco systems on his way to the summit. Mt Kilimanjaro is the highest mountain in Africa and one of the largest volcanoes ever to break through the earth's crust. Jason will be trekking for 7 days with only a small tent to call home; he is actively training to get into shape for the mammoth task.

Richmond Mayor Councillor Clare Head visited St Margarets recently to help launch, local trader Jason Payne's campaign to raise funds for Cancer Research UK.

Jason who runs Crown Classic Cars in Crown Road St Margarets is planning to trek the 5895 metres to the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro in March next year.

Jason's trek will take him through four eco systems on his way to the summit. Mt Kilimanjaro is the highest mountain in Africa and one of the largest volcanoes ever to break through the earth's crust. Jason will be trekking for 7 days with only a small tent to call home; he is actively training to get into shape for the mammoth task.

Jason comments 'My lovely wife was diagnosed with the dreaded Big C, I felt that I needed to do something to help support Cancer Research in the UK. The treatment and care given by the hospital staff was amazing and as we are now nearing the 5 year all clear it is now time for me to fulfil my pledge and get fund raising.'

The Mayor wished Jason well with his challenge and commented 'This is a truly wonderful example of somebody giving something back to a charity that is so supportive.'

Jason added 'I know that cancer touches everyone's lives at some point and I know that every penny raised will help to combat this awful disease. I hope you will help me help others, as every penny counts.' To donate to Jason's appeal please see his Just Giving page at [www.justgiving.com/Jason-Payne1](http://www.justgiving.com/Jason-Payne1).
