Pop-up Opera is an innovative touring opera company which takes opera to unusual venues. We bring opera to bars, boats, barns, and all sorts of unexpected places. Productions are uniquely adapted to each individual venue but will maintain the highest professional standards. The originality of the settings will reveal the universal appeal of opera.

We are touring "a production of Donizetti's comic opera Don Pasquale":http://www.popupopera.co.uk/productions.php, with four singers and piano, and our director, who adapts the production uniquely to each venue. We are performing the opera at the Turk's Head pub in St Margarets on Tuesday 12<sup>th</sup> July.
