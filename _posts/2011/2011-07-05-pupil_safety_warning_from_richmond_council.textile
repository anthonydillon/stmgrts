<div class="letter">

h4. Notification to  schools - Pupil safety

Please could you notify all parents that yesterday, at the vicarage garden at Michael's Church, Barnes, there was an attempted abduction of a child. The child concerned managed to escape and was unharmed, though very frightened. The police were involved, but unfortunately the person got away and there was not a clear sighting of him (the child was pulled from behind). Please remind all parents to exercise increased vigilance with regards to the whereabouts of their children following this incident.

Regards

Tessa Moore
_Head of School Effectiveness_

Barbara Murray
_Deputy Director Children's Services_

_Note: We just received this from St Stephens School, sent to all parents._
