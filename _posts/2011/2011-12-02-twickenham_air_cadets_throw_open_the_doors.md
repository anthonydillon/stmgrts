Twickenham's 267 Squadron ATC threw open its doors last night to welcome family, friends and former cadets at a special open evening at the new Cadet Centre in London Road.

Over fifty visitors saw the cadets of all ages enjoying a range of activities from First Aid to aircraft modelling, and a lesson on the principles of flight.

The Cadet Centre was officially opened in October by Dr Vince Cable and this is the first opportunity for parents and potential cadets to visit the new premises.

Middlesex Wing Commander David Hale said "You have a very fine facility here - it will not have the charm of the old one but it is you young cadets of today who will give the centre its tradition for the cadets of the future. I am grateful to the staff and the families who provide you with so much support and encouragement."

On the final parade of the evening, and watched by proud parents, Wing Commander Hale announced the promotions of both Tim Evans to Cadet Sergeant and Tara Crank to Flight Sergeant.

Eighteen year old Flight Sergeant Tara Crank, formerly of Whitton School, plans a career in medicine and enjoys fencing as her other hobby. She modestly admits to being in the top 43 in senior ranking in the UK Fencing world.

The squadron will now continue with its normal parade activities on a Tuesday and Thursday evening at the London Road Cadet Centre. Young people interested can make enquiries at the centre on either of these evenings or find out more at [www.aircadets.org](http://www.aircadets.org)
