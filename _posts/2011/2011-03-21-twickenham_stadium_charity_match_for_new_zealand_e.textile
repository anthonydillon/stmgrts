p=. INVESTEC SUPER RUGBY - Crusaders v Sharks

p=. Sunday 27<sup>th</sup> March 2011, Twickenham Stadium - Kick off 4pm

p=. _Supporting the Red Cross Earthquake appeal in New Zealand_

New Zealand's Crusaders Investec Super Rugby match against the Sharks from South Africa has been confirmed at Twickenham Stadium on Sunday 27 March at 4pm.

We regret the short notice of this match which is an extremely unusual occurrence for a Twickenham event. The maximum attendance will be 45 -55,000 which is some 30,000 less than the capacity of a major match.

The RFU agreed to host the match following consultations with the police, transport authorities and the local authority. Local parking controls will be in operation around the stadium event day zone from 12 noon to 8pm.

The game will raise funds for the Red Cross Earthquake appeal in New Zealand as well as helping out the Crusaders, as their home stadium in Christchurch is currently out of action following the earthquake. &pound;5 from each ticket sold will go to the earthquake appeal.
