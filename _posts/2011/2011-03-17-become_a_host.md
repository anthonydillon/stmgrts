*Here is an unusual opportunity to practise a bit of international diplomacy in your own home.*

[HOST](http://www.hostuk.org.uk), a well-established national charity, is looking for new volunteer hosts to offer the occasional one-off day, weekend or Christmas invitation to international students at UK universities. Far from their own homes, these adult students, including many from China, India and the USA, mostly post-grads, are keen to discover more about the way of life in this country,and are happy to share their own culture with their hosts. They all speak English. Volunteer hosts of all ages and walks of life are urgently needed. This is an interesting way to enjoy a weekend, and makes a worthwhile contribution to international understanding and goodwill.
