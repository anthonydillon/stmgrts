For Fairtrade Fortnight (28 Feb - 13 March), Richmond Fairtrade ([www.richmondfairtrade.org.uk](http://www.richmondfairtrade.org.uk)) ran a cotton bunting competition for all borough schools to help the Fairtrade Foundation break the record for the world's longest length of hand-designed bunting - a massive 2.7km.

All participating schools were invited to a tea party with the Deputy Mayor at which prizes were awarded to Bishop Perrin Primary, East Sheen Primary, St Elizabeth's Primary, Teddington Secondary, and Strathmore. The party was lots of fun with plenty of consumable Fairtrade goodies, a flag decorating workshop led by Orleans House Gallery and some very popular dancing mats. Over 90 metres of bunting were sent to the Fairtrade Foundation, who will announce the total length in early May.

At Lady Eleanor Holles school teachers walked the catwalk in Fairtrade cotton t-shirts decorated by the girls to convey the message of fair trade.
