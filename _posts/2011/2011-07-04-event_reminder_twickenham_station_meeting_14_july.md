Residents are invited to have their say on the plans to redevelop Twickenham station at a public meeting at Richmond College in Egerton Road, on Thursday July 14, from 7 to 9 pm. It is being organised by the Twickenham Advisory Panel; a presentation from Solum - a joint venture between Network Rail and Kier Property - will be followed by a question and answer session. The panel asks residents to send in written questions in advance of the meeting: email <tap@richmond.gov.uk> or call 8487 5016.
