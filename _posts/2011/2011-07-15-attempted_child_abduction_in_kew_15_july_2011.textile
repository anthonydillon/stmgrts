We have spoken to the Police.  This story is *not* true.  Apparently there have been many rumours going around, but still only the single incident in Barnes.

<del>Apparently there has been another "attempted child abduction":http://cms.met.police.uk/met/boroughs/richmond_upon_thames/04how_are_we_doing/news/statement_regarding_incidents_on_towpath_and_alleged_attempted_abduction_of_a_boy_under_the_age_of_10 in Kew.</del>

<del>Police are looking for a man in white puffer jacket and shorts with a cap.</del>

Please be careful.

<em>Note, we have been passed this warning from a community member, not the Police and well after "this article from the Richmond and Twickenham Times":http://www.richmondandtwickenhamtimes.co.uk/news/9142947.Police_calm_fears_of_abductions__but_urge_continued_vigilance/ was published</em>
