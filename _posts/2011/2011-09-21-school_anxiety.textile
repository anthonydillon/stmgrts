    It's a fact that there is an anticipated shortfall of 306 school places Borough wide in the 2012/13 academic year.
    
    At the gates of your average nursery or pre-school in and around St Margarets' there has been a lot of discussion and anxiety surrounding schooling.  Where will we get a place for our little ones when they are 4? Will we get a place?  Will we have to traipse across the Borough to go to a school not of choosing? Many parents have been surprised that they simply have not been given a place for their 4 year old due to the chronic shortage of places.

It's a fact that there is an anticipated shortfall of 306 school places Borough wide in the 2012/13 academic year.

At the gates of your average nursery or pre-school in and around St Margarets' there has been a lot of discussion and anxiety surrounding schooling.  Where will we get a place for our little ones when they are 4? Will we get a place?  Will we have to traipse across the Borough to go to a school not of choosing? Many parents have been surprised that they simply have not been given a place for their 4 year old due to the chronic shortage of places.

In addition to this, the Council has recently shelved 50% of the development plans to build additional forms which has put the issue even more into the limelight.

So, what are people doing about this? Where did you end up schooling your 4 or 5 year old this September and how far from your home do you have to travel so that your child can attend this school? We'd love to hear people's stories, so please leave a comment here (and a street if you can) and "vote in our poll":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/poll/SCHOOLS
