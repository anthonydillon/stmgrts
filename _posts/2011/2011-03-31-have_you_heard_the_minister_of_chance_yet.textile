_Well, you should._

Masterminded from Amyand Park Road, Clare Eden and Bruce Collingwood have created a whole new thing, a modern, pay-as-you-go radio-play.

For the first time high quality audio drama is available directly to the public as an mp3 download so you can listen at any time that suits -- on a computer/mp3 player/ipod/kindle etc... An award winning production team creates the innovative MINISTER OF CHANCE starring Jenny Agutter, Paul McGann,Sylvester McCoy and with local resident Julian Wadham in the title role.


bq. "This particular story arc (Prologue & 2 episodes) is what we intend will be a long running series but ultimately it's just one of many varied dramas & comedies on our development slate if we can sell this and finance production of the next block.  Aimed at anyone who enjoys good audio drama but we're also hoping we might reach a teenage audience -- we have a whole generation now glued permanently to modern technology on facebook, ipods and apps --  how fantastic if we could bring the world of creativity and dramatic performance to meet them in their world on their headphones!"

Clare has been the Executive Producer for this series.  Bruce has designed "the website":http://www.ministerofchance.com and Dan Freeman has written, directed and produced - Dan won the Spoken Word Gold Award for his last BBC drama.

"www.ministerofchance.com":http://www.ministerofchance.com  will give you access to the free 9 minute prologue starring Paul McGann, as well as the trailer for the whole series.  The Minister's adventures will begin in Episode One (35 mins)  which is available for &pound;1.49 from our website. Episode 2 follows on 14 April,  also at &pound;1.49.
