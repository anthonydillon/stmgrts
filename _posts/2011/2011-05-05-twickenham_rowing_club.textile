_Time to get back on the river... Calling all rowers!_

Spring is here, the days are getting longer, what better way to spend your spare time than on the water? Maybe you've just finished Uni or recently moved to the area and are looking to continue rowing at a local club? Or maybe you used to row and have had a break for a while but would love to get back into it.

Twickenham Rowing Club is looking for experienced male and female rowers to join our Senior squads. We are a friendly, well-established club with excellent weights and rowing coaches and a structured training plan in place. We are competitive at local regattas and have entered crews for Henley for over 130 years. This year we are hoping to build on the success of previous years.

We are also looking for coxes. If you have coxing experience or are looking to learn how to cox with a view to racing with us this summer, we would love to hear from you.

If you are interested in hearing more about what the club has to offer, meeting some of us or having a look around the clubhouse, please email "twixmembership@gmail.com":mailto:twixmembership@gmail.com.
