    The Smarter St Stephen's first ever Duathlon took place on Wednesday, 2 November 2011 in Moormead Park.  An amazing all day event with over 300 pupils from St Stephen's School taking part.  The children, aged 7 - 11, had to run, cycle and run again around Moormead Park to raise money for the Smarter St Stephen's campaign.  Local Estate Agent, Churchills, sponsored the event and England Rugby International, Simon Shaw, presented the trophies in a school assembly.

The Smarter St Stephen's first ever Duathlon took place on Wednesday, 2 November 2011 in Moormead Park.  An amazing all day event with over 300 pupils from St Stephen's School taking part.  The children, aged 7 - 11, had to run, cycle and run again around Moormead Park to raise money for the Smarter St Stephen's campaign.  Local Estate Agent, Churchills, sponsored the event and England Rugby International, Simon Shaw, presented the trophies in a school assembly.

Since St Stephen's launched it's fundraising campaign in June this year, staff, parents and the local St Margarets community have pulled together and raised an incredible &pound;25,000 in just over 4 months. The money is going towards improving the school facilities.  A 'makeover' of the school hall has already started and future plans include improvements to the school's outside spaces.
