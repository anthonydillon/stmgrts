[Saturday 23<sup>rd</sup> July 2011, 7.30pm](/event/show/200705142859)

The magnificent Michael Flanders and Donald Swann are no longer with us - but you can catch a whole evening of their wonderful comic songs at the Normansfield Theatre, Langdon Down Centre, Teddington, at 7.30pm.

Their names will be associated forever with the likes of "The Hippopotamus" ("Mud, mud, glorious mud"), "A Transport of Delight" ("...ninety-seven horsepower omnibus") and "The Gasman Cometh". Now, in "A Celebration of Flanders & Swann", Gordon Peters and David Carter bring their own interpretation of this very British look at life.

Both bring impressive show-business credentials. Gordon Peters can boast of fifty years as comic, actor and director - in his words, "earning a crust - and occasionally a piece of cake". He is instantly recognisable from a range of tv programmes including "Dad's Army, "One Foot In The Grave", and "Little Britain". David Carter was Danny La Rue's Musical Director for many years, and has accompanied a host of stars.

Flanders and Swann were responsible for what was surely one of the West End's most extraordinary musical hits, back in the 1950s. The audiences loved it!
