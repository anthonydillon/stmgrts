> Michael "Mac" McGann was a folk singer and songwriter, a unique guitarist, barrelhouse blues pianist, harmonica player, graphic artist, wood carver and cartoonist. He was best-known for his live performances in pubs and clubs around London alongside guitarists and singers who would become more famous - including John Martyn, John Renbourn, Ralph McTell and the "King of the Buskers" Don Partridge. McGann co-founded several folk bands, including the Levee Breakers in the 1960s with the 12-string guitarist Johnny Joyce and singer Beverley Kutner (later to become Beverley Martyn). They were a breakthrough outfit who became a major influence on McTell and such folk groups as Pentangle, with Renbourn and Bert Jantsch, and later the Incredible String Band.

>  McTell, who would make his name with Streets of London, was inspired by McGann, whom he described as "truly in the vanguard of the singer/songwriter movement, long before the term was coined." McGann played his unique, self-designed double-neck guitar on McTell's early solo albums and on many tracks laid down by the popular '70s rock band McGuinness Flint.
