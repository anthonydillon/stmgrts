    New simpler parking charges are being introduced during April/May; the changes remove the CO2 tax linkage on parking tariffs and introduces for residents the opportunity to have 30 minutes free parking or a discount on the general tariffs applicable for the car park/on street location. By using a Richmond Card residents will receive 10% discount and for those residents over 75 years old the discount will increase to 20%.
    
    All new Richmond Cards will be issued based on these changes.
