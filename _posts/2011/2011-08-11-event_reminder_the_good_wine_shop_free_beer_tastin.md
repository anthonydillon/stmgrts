[Saturday 13<sup>th</sup> August from 2pm](/event/event/200705142933) at our St Margarets shop we are hosting a FREE beer tasting of Brewers & Union beers from the Sao Gabriel Collective.

Brewers & Union believe the beer giants have lost their passion and aim to put things right with their quest for more authenticity and substance.

They have found artisan-produced German beers from some of Europe's oldest family-run breweries and worked hand-in-hand with brewmasters to develop the finest lagers and ales.

Come along and see what you think!

#### THE BREWERS & UNION BEERS TO TRY:

-   **Versus Goliath** - A copper coloured amber lager with a toasty yet malty flavour. Hints of vanilla, caramel and toffee.
-   **Unfiltered Lager** - An industrial brewer simply couldn't make a beer like this. Unfiltered, unpasteurised and bursting with flavour it has phenomenal body and freshness.
-   **Steph Weiss** - Liquid sunshine. Delicate, smooth and creamy - a true unfiltered Bavarian white beer with aromas of vanilla and clove.
-   \*Berne - Unfiltered amber lager in a rare old German style. Wholesome and buttery with toasty bready malts and hints of caramel and toffee. A smooth and naturally cloudy beer.
-   **Dark Lager** - Very drinkable, dry and beautifully hopped yet rich and loaded with dark roasted malt flavour. Relatively light in body but bursting with character.
