    We are currently planning the next edition of "My St Margarets Magazine":http://www.mystmargarets.com/our_magazine/. The autumn edition is due to be published in September and will feature local authors. We are keen to hear from any local writers who have had their works published and perhaps might like a write up in the magazine.
    
    If you or somebody you know are interested in being included in the feature please contact "traders@mystmargarets.com":mailto:traders@mystmargarets.com
