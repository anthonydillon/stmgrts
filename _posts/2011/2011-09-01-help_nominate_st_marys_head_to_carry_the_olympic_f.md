Stuart Campbell, head teacher at St Mary's schools, has been nominated to carry the Olympic Flame in the London 2012 Olympic Torch Relay.

> "Mr Campbell is an amazing head teacher who runs a infant and junior school (St. Mary's in Twickenham) over 2 different locations and will soon be 3 locations. He works tirelessly to ensure outstanding results for the children. He is very special and knows every child's name has time for everyone even though he is very busy. I think he made a huge difference to our community."
