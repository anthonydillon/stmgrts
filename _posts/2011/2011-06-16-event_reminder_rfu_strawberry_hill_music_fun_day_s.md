On Sunday 26<sup>th</sup> June the Rugby Football Union presents the annual [Strawberry Hill Music & Family Fun Day](http://www.strawberryhillmusicday.co.uk) in the grounds of the gothic house on Waldegrave Road, Twickenham. Over 7,000 attended last year.

As well as providing the community with a fun day out, the aim is to raise funds for restoration of Horace Walpole's little gothic castle, Strawberry Hill House and local charities.

Once again there will be the popular live music stage, charity and craft stalls, children's rides and entertainment, beer and Pimms tents, food and refreshments. Why not bring a picnic and enjoy the day.

From 12noon until 7.30pm the music stage will feature bands, mostly with a local connection: Leaf Hound, Skalextric, The Mustangs, Robin Bibi Band, Cry No More, Nark Drool & The Shudders, All Theory No Action, The Carnabys and The Orleans Park School Soul Band.
