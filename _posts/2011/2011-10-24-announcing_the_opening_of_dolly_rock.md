*The [St Margarets Traders Association](http://www.mystmargarets.com) is proud to announce the latest edition to St Margarets - **Dolly Rock boutique** at 14 Crown Road St Margarets.*

Beth Huett & Nikki Kirsopp the boutiques owners say:

> "With many years experience between us in the fashion industry covering design, retail management, personal shopping and styling. Our passion for fashion is from head to toe.
> 
>  After creating many new wardrobes and seeing the excitement and new found confidence that clothes bring, we wanted to give the customer a new and unique way of shopping. So we decided to create Dolly Rock boutique, where you'll find exclusive collections set in a relaxed and friendly environment incorporated with a private personal styling suite downstairs that gives you the opportunity to have the experience of one on one styling consultations.
> 
>  So whatever your budget or occasion, if you are looking for a key Christmas piece or a new wardrobe to start the New Year, we are your girls."

 Come and find us at 14 Crown Road, St Margarets, Twickenham
