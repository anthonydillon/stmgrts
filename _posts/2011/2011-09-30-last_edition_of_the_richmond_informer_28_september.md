This week's edition of the Richmond Informer is the last that will be published.

The paper will no longer be distributed, along with its sister title the Kingston Informer. The Informer's website [www.richmondinformer.co.uk](http://www.richmondinformer.co.uk) will also be closing down, and readers will be re-directed to our sister website, [www.hounslowchronicle.co.uk](http://www.hounslowchronicle.co.uk)

Regrettably, tough economic conditions have led to the titles not being sustainable in the market.

We would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our readers and advertisers who have supported the paper over the years.

The Informer has had a proud tradition of being at the heart of the borough. bringing you the latest news and views from all walks of life and has always strived to make sure you enjoy journalism of the highest standard.

It has campaigned on news issues and brought into sharp focus what is relevant and what really affected you the reader. We would like to think it has been like a friend dropping through your letterbox every week.

It has also provided businesses with the most effective advertising platforms, maximising commercial potential.

We are extremely grateful to all the people who have contributed news and sport reports; you have been valuable supporters of the Informer.

Informer reporter Rupert Basham said:
