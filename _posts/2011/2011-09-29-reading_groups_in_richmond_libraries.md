    _Explore new books! Discover new authors! Swap reading ideas in a friendly library environment!_

    Richmond libraries are keen to support and encourage local reading groups.  Reading groups are a good way to meet new people and share your passion for reading. They are a great way to try out a range of different books and authors, developing and challenging your reading habits. Groups can read anything from crime to poetry, graphic novels to classics, or focus on a particular genre.
