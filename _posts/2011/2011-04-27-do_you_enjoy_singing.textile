Then come and make some musical magic with St Stephen's Community Choir!

We meet once a fortnight on Thursday evenings and sing everything from gospel, jazz and show tunes to folk and African songs.

We started singing together six years ago as parents at St Stephen's School in Twickenham, and we've since grown to become a community choir which welcomes new members of any ability and experience -- from shower-singers to concert hall divas!

Recent gigs include a charity Christmas concert at the Tea Box in Richmond and our first annual concert at the ETNA Centre in East Twickenham. We also continue to sing at school events including the annual Carol Concert at St Stephens Church.

Several of us have taken part in the popular St Margarets community operas; _A Very Magical Flute_ (2006), _Carmen_ (2007), _Hansel and Gretel_ (2008), _Robinson Crusoe_ (2009) and _La Cenerentola_ (2010).

We're also stars of YouTube!
