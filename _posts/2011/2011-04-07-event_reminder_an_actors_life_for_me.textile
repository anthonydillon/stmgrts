On "Saturday, 21<sup>st</sup> May 2011":https://stmargarets.london/event/play/200705142768, The English Chamber Theatre presents "An Actor's Life for Me!" starring Honor Blackman and Nickolas Grace.  Devised and Directed by Jane McCulloch.

This hilarious and poignant show gives an entertaining glimpse of the life of an actor, from the early years of child star, through drama school and repertory theatre, to the mature years and final performances of the aged thespian.

Anecdotes and Green Room stories abound, along with tales of theatrical legends. Material is drawn from many sources - Noel Coward, Ellen Terry, Edmund Kean, Beerbohm Tree, Gielgud, Wolfit and many, many others.

Discover what really happens behind the curtain, from The Lives, The Wives, The Mistresses and... The Mothers!
