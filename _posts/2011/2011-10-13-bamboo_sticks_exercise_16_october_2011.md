    _Sunday, 16<sup>th</sup> October 2011 at 9am in Marble Hill Park near the car park_
    
    Local resident Daphne Cotton is offering an introductory session to this unusual exercise routine in aid of Amnesty International. Otherwise known as the "Art of the Longevity Stick",  these exercises will strengthen your body, build up your immune system and make you feel good, especially if you do them first thing in the morning out in your local park. The half marathon completed, Daphne would now like to see 100 local residents out in Marble Hill Park on Sunday morning to complete her fundraising activity. If you have already donated to the cause it is free and if you don't wish to donate, come anyway and explore Bamboo Sticks!
