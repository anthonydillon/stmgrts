_Inspiring creativity, confidence and well-being._

This new and unique approach to health and wellbeing uses breathing, warm ups, stretches, and rhythmic and vocal exercises to develop the power and range of your voice and gain confidence in singing and speaking. Harnessing the power of your voice has many health benefits- among them relieving stress, working your abdominal core muscles, thereby helping to improve posture. It also stimulates the cardio-vascular system- in other words gives your body a good work-out





No experience is necessary and you do not have to be a singer to attend these fun and relaxed workshops. They also include opportunities to learn to improvise and harmonise, playing with your voice and draw on music from many styles, cultures and eras. Drums and percussion

Surya Cooper draws on her vast experience of teaching Yoga, Voice and Music to children and adults, working in the fields of education, counselling and personal development to create these special workshops. She plays guitar and ukulele, and a assortment of drums and percussion are provided to further enliven workshops .
