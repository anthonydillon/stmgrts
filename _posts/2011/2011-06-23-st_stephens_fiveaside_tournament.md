    Saturday, the 18<sup>th</sup> June 2011, was St Stephen Junior School's annual five-a-side tournament.  Each year group had their own mini-round-robin and champion.  There were also trophies for 'best dressed' and boy and girl of the match.  The weather mostly co-operated with only the Year 5 group getting hit with a gale.  The day was a huge success.

    Well done to all who participated!
