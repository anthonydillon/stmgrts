    Richard Lomas, a resident of St Margarets, is one of a team of around 20 attempting the Three Peaks Challenge in honour of their friend and colleague, Francesco Anstey, who passed away in May earlier this year.  They are hoping to raise as much money as possible for the Anstey family's chosen charity, the "Samantha Dickson Brain Tumour Trust":http://braintumourtrust.co.uk/.

    Francesco, a former colleague of Richard's, sadly passed away after an outrageous, courageous fight against the odds.  Francesco was aged just 23 and his job at Firebrand Digital Ltd was his first "proper" one after recent graduation from the Royal Holloway University.

Richard Lomas, a resident of St Margarets, is one of a team of around 20 attempting the Three Peaks Challenge in honour of their friend and colleague, Francesco Anstey, who passed away in May earlier this year.  They are hoping to raise as much money as possible for the Anstey family's chosen charity, the "Samantha Dickson Brain Tumour Trust":http://braintumourtrust.co.uk/.

Francesco, a former colleague of Richard's, sadly passed away after an outrageous, courageous fight against the odds.  Francesco was aged just 23 and his job at Firebrand Digital Ltd was his first "proper" one after recent graduation from the Royal Holloway University.

The Three Peaks Challenge, climbing Ben Nevis (Scotland), Snowdon (Wales) and Scafell Pike (England) in 24 hours, will be attempted the first weekend in September 2011, in honour and memory of Francesco.

There are numerous charity-raising events coming-up over the coming weeks, including "a special (hijacked) quiz at the St Margarets Tavern on 16 August 2011":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/event/event/200705142953.  The evening's fun will include a coconut shy, and special coconut recipe ideas from "@whatsforteadear":http://www.twitter.com/whatsforteadear (plus lots lots more!).  There is also a special charity/society lottery/raffle that will be launched as part of the night (plus, again lots, lots more...)
