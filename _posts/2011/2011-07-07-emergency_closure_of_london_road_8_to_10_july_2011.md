Due to emergency gas works in London Road, Richmond Council is going to have to close the road affecting southbound traffic in a part of London Road, Twickenham.

Whilst the works take place no person may permit a vehicle to proceed in a southbound direction along London Road from its junction with A 316 Chertsey Road to its junction with Whitton Road and Cole Park Road.

The road closure will be in force at 10am on Friday 8 July 2011. It is anticipated that this length of London Road will remain closed to southbound traffic until 10pm on Sunday 10 July, although it may remain closed for a longer period if the emergency works have not been completed by that time.

Traffic will be diverted via A316 Chertsey Road and B361 Whitton Road.
