RHYTHM FORCE was launched in 2006 to showcase the Corps of Army Music's contemporary musical talent.  The RFU has agreed to sponsor the highly popular event as part of the "Great River Race":https://stmargarets.london/event/event/200705142952 and "Twickenham Riverside Regatta Weekend":https://stmargarets.london/event/fair/200705142981  on 17<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup> September with two nights of concerts in Orleans Gardens on Saturday 17 & Sunday 18 Sept 6.45pm-10.45pm.

The Corps is delighted to have this opportunity to continue to develop its contemporary music, rock and pop bands. They hope that their loyal fans will continue to support them until their return to traditional home Kneller Hall.

Each night there will be three of the best army contemporary groups and a special guest group. Both concerts will finish with the superb Army Big Band.

The concerts will maintain the picnic and party atmosphere inside the big riverside marquee. We do hope you will join us for what is sure to be two very special concerts on a special weekend in Twickenham.
