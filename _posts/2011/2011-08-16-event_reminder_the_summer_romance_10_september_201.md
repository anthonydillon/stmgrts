#### About Ester

Ester Svandova was born in 1986 in Prague into a professional musical family. She plays violin and piano, but since a young age her greatest passion was singing. Initally, she sang folk songs from a rich Czech musical inheritance, but later started to take singing seriously and is now focused on classical music. She performed Czech arias by Smetana with the Prague Student Orchestra in Rudolfinum, where she also played the violin. Ester moved to London three years ago and started to study singing with Jacqueline Bremar. She is also coached by Lada Valesova, Alex Ingram and recently started to study with Ludmilla Andrew. Since living in London she has performed at many private soirées and concerts and is busy building a repertoire for her mezzo voice. This year she sang the role of Pitti Sing in Mikado with the Eynsford based company Riverside Players. Her biggest passion is for songs and some of her favorites will be performed this evening.
