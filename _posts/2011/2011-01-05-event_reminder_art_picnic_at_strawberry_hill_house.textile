Horace Walpole's Gothic castle is undergoing an &pound;8.9 million restoration and the first phase is complete. The house will be closed until 2 April whilst important conservation work continues, but the Environment Trust has been offered a special opportunity to spend a day drawing the interior spaces with tuition by popular local artist Jill Storey.

Materials for sketching (paper, pencils, and charcoal) and drawing boards will be provided, but you are welcome to bring your own equipment if you prefer.  Don't forget to bring a picnic lunch too. We meet at Strawberry Hill House at 11am at the horseshoe in front of the main entrance on Waldegrave Road.  The day will end at 4pm after a discussion about our achievements. This will be a very popular art picnic, so be sure to book early!
