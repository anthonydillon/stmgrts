Once again, we've teamed up with Scottish craft brewery, BrewDog, to give you a unique opportunity to try many of their different beers including (we are told) some new ones, yet to be announced!  Watch this space, but the evening is sure to be full of new and exciting styles, as well as their established favourites... Plus, we'll get a cask on for the night of something different.

This is a completely free event to attend at our shop in Twickenham.
