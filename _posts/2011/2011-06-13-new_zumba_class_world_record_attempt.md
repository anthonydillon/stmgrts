We are still awaiting *official* confirmation; however, according to a photo on [the official Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=group_109292832430088) and from an attendee, it looks like they succeeded in being the *worlds largest outdoor Zumba class*.

Thank you to Graham Bancroft for the excellent photos of the day. [See the slideshow on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com//photos/mahnke/sets/72157626826457931/show/)
