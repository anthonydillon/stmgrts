The "St Margarets Traders Association":http://www.mystmargarets.com has published a leaflet that will soon be distributed to local residents.  It highlights the Traders ideas for improving the high street without cost to the Council.

bq. "We love St Margarets and care that it retains its village atmosphere and unique identity. We don't want St Margarets to become another faceless town dominated by the major multiples or allow it to deteriorate to an area plagued by unsightly and vacant shop units. The St Margarets Traders Association has been working hard to ensure that we promote and protect all that is special about St Margarets."

Ideas include getting a fishmonger and a bakery and adding more retail space on St Margarets and Crown Roads.
