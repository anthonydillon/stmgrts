    It was a wet and windy day, but that didn't stop thousands of people coming out and supporting the 33<sup>rd</sup> Annual St Margarets Fair.  While the weather caused a few displays to be cancelled, nearly everything else went to plan, including the always popular dog show and music stage.

Thank you to all those who volunteered their time, specially the St Margarets Fair Committee.
