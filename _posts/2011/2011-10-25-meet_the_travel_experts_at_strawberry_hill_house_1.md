*Spend an inspiring day at historic Strawberry Hill House and plan your next holiday with expert assistance*

Old Isleworth-based Sunvil and its sister companies Expert Africa and GIC The Villa Collection are hosting a 'Meet the Travel Experts' event at Strawberry Hill House on Saturday 19 November, 2011, from 9:30am to 5:30pm.

Guests will have the opportunity to spend a leisurely day learning about Latin America and some of its exciting islands, such as the Galapagos, the San Blas archipelago off Panama or Brazil's Fernando de Noronha, plus Africa and the Seychelles or, closer to home, Portugal, including the Alentejo with its unspoilt Atlantic coast, the Azores and Madeira. Also featured will be Italy - plus Sicily and the Aeolian islands - Greece, Scandinavia with its 30,000-strong archipelagos, the Faroe Islands, Cyprus and Romania.

Included in the 'Meet the Travel Experts' day is a free guided tour (worth £12.50 per person) of the newly-renovated Strawberry Hill House, a fascinating Gothic castle that was once Horace Walpole's home and which inspired buildings such as the Houses of Parliament. Available throughout the day will be coffee, tea, soft drinks and biscuits. A light buffet lunch of sandwiches (pre-booking is required) will be served in the café.

Along with travel experts from the tourist boards for Sweden, Cyprus, Greece, the Alentejo (Portugal) and Central America, Sunvil's expert teams will be dotted around Strawberry Hill House - in the Great Parlour, the Library and the Little Parlour - ready to provide fascinating travel inspiration and chat through all kinds of holiday ideas.

To enhance the day, there will be a series of destination presentations (for 20 people maximum) as follows:
