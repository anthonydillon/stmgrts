The Richmond & Twickenham Photographic Society (RTPS) is holding its Annual Exhibition at the Landmark Arts Centre in Teddington from [Wednesday 13 April to Monday 25 April](https://stmargarets.london/event/show/200705142769).

More than 50 local photographers will be showing their work and you can vote for your favourite. An exhibition by members of The Royal Photographic Society's Visual Art Group will also be on display, as well as Photography GSCE and A Level exam work by students from St Catherine's School for Girls, in Twickenham.

Many of the photographs will be for sale and the Exhibition Shop will be selling cards, photography books and all sorts of photographic paraphernalia. Members of the Society will be on hand throughout the day to discuss the work on display or to talk about photography in general - there's nothing they enjoy more. You can also find out more about RTPS and how to join.

It promises to be a real treat!
