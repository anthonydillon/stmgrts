Richmond Riverside comes alive "from 1 to 8pm, Saturday, 20 August 2011":http://stmargarets.london/event/concert/200705142986 to the sights and sounds of live music and dance from across the globe. Now in its sixteenth year, this much-loved festival offers the borough's residents and world music enthusiasts eight hours of fantastic free entertainment.

Grab your picnic basket and dancing shoes and head down to On the Edge.

From the Caribbean beats of Tropical Storm and the sultry Jesus Cutino & Son de Cuba, to Karan's Bollywood performance and workshop which will have everyone their feet! Zambula change the mood with music from Uganda and the Congo before Toby Nowell's Runaway Wedding Band bring their own riotous melee of Balkan bebop, with Serbian songs, high speed coceks and Balkan brass classics. Dancing will be unavoidable!
