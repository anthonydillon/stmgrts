    As this is a _very_ slow news week, unless you are Angelina Jolie spotting, a friend of St Margarets Community Website suggested we introduce <a href="http://www.ted.com/">TED Talks</a> to everyone. TED is a nonprofit devoted to _Ideas Worth Spreading_. It started out in 1984 as a conference bringing together people from three worlds: Technology, Entertainment, Design but has now grown far beyond that with over 900 talks online.  The talks are only 20 minutes and are all persuasive, fascinating, inspiring and informative.
