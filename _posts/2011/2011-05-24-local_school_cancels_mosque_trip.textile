h4. Orleans Infant School headteacher defends decision to cancel mosque trip over terror attack fears

A headteacher today defended her decision to cancel a school trip to a mosque over fears of revenge attacks in the wake of the death of Osama bin Laden.

Pupils from Orleans Infant School, St Margarets, were due to visit Hounslow Mosque today as part of their studies on major faiths.

But letters were sent to parents last week saying the year 1 trip was to be cancelled over safety fears following the death of the Al-Qaeda leader on May 2.

Jane Evans, headteacher of the school in Hartington Road, said her "first duty" was the safety of pupils at the school.
