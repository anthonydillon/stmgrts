We're often asked for more information about the bands that play at the fair. Please find below a short bio of each of the bands.

### St Margarets Elastic Band

The St Margarets Elastic Band are back again to play their Christmas selection of popular hits- the band gets a bit bigger each year (possibly too many mince pies) and now boasts a tuba or two to provide that extra bit of early morning music excitement

### Anacousis Jazz Quintet

The name's Greek for Hear Us.We play quality Jazz for everyone. We like to entertain, and play from the classic Jazz era Our mellow sounds come from the Sax, and Bb/Bass Clarinets, supported by a fine rhythm section. Visit: [www.anacousisjazzquintet.com](http://www.anacousisjazzquintet.com)

### Shelle Luscombe

Shelle Luscombe lives in Twickenham and sings a real mixed bag of popular covers from the 50s to the present day. She touches on just about every genre of music from jazz, blues and soul through to motown, disco and good old rock n roll. Check out [www.shelleluscombe.co.uk](http://www.shelleluscombe.co.uk) to hear tracks and view Shelle's demo video.
3am

Soulful, passionate vocals fronting blues-guitar-based rock songs written by the band or inspired by the best female singers including Janis Joplin, Etta James, Gladys Knight and Elkie Brooks. Blues you can get your teeth into!

### Richmond Youth Brass Band

Richmond Youth Brass Band has performed at many prestigious events across the Borough including the Mayor of Richmond's Charity Ball and concerts for Hampton Fuel Allotment Charity and Richmond Parish Lands. The Band, for 8-16 year olds, is run by Richmond Music Trust and meets on Saturday mornings at Waldegrave School. For more details see: [www.richmondmusictrust.org.uk](http://www.richmondmusictrust.org.uk/)

### Orleans Brass Bunch

Orleans Brass Bunch reformed earlier this year playing creative or unusual arrangements of well known pieces, such as Mango Walk and Linstead Market. The group is sustained by the real fun and enthusiasm of its players drawn from years 7-11, as well as the parents and brass coaches who support it.

### Anthony Alix band

Alix is from New York and toured America, including a night supporting Duran Duran at Madison Square Garden, before stints in Toronto and Dubai. His trio now plays London with his funky soul hits and what a big sound 3 people can make!

*A special thank you to all of the bands and to Alistair Wright of Radio Jackie who organises the music at the fair and act as MC.*
