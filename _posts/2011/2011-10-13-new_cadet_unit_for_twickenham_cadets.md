The Right Honourable Dr Vince Cable MP for Twickenham was guest of honour at the official opening of the long awaited new cadet centre in London Road Twickenham.

Cadets, staff, friends and supporters toured the new building which will serve the needs both of 196 Twickenham Army Cadet Force (Royal Engineers) Detachment and of 267 (Twickenham) Squadron Air Training Corps.

Unveiling the commemorative plaque Dr Cable said;

> "As a local person I am very pleased to have been asked to open this joint Army and Air Cadet centre. The cadets provide a great service to the local community here in Twickenham. This centre will at last provide both cadet units with a place where they can learn together the many skills that the cadet world offers. I wish you well in your cadet times."

Both local cadet units were forced to vacate what had become unsuitable accommodation and through the Greater London Reserve Forces' and Cadets' Association a fine new centre with modern facilities had been provided to help serve the needs of young people in the area.
