    Of all the people watching the Royal Wedding today, the fervent monarchists with their flags and souvenir teaspoons, the republicans grumbling about the cost of the nonsense, the _fashionistas_ going on about 'that' dress, it is young people who will be most affected by it. With their lives stretching way ahead of them it is our children who will subjects in a country 'ruled' by King William and his Queen, Catherine.

Of all the people watching the Royal Wedding today, the fervent monarchists with their flags and souvenir teaspoons, the republicans grumbling about the cost of the nonsense, the _fashionistas_ going on about 'that' dress, it is young people who will be most affected by it. With their lives stretching way ahead of them it is our children who will subjects in a country 'ruled' by King William and his Queen, Catherine.

So what do they think about that prospect? Last night I put a simple question to a totally unrepresentative group of 8 -10 year olds, the _1<sup>st</sup> St Margarets Cub Pack_. Would they rather live in a country 'ruled' by a President, like France or America or in a monarchy, like the United Kingdom? Here are the results: &ndash;

|  |*Votes*|
|A PRESIDENT|12|
|A KING OR QUEEN|12|

Does this clean and precise 50/50 split mean that our monarchy is safe for the next 100 years - or does it mean that there is latent republicanism lurking in the hearts of the nation's children - or does it mean that I should have asked a control question like, "Would you rather live in a country ruled by Wallace and Grommit"?

As for me, I'll be creosoting the shed.
