Dear friends,

<a href="//stmgrts.org.uk/assets/images/2011/minister_of_chance_logo.gif" title="See larger version of - Minister of Chance logo"><img src="//stmgrts.org.uk/assets/images/2011/minister_of_chance_logo_thumb.gif" width="150" height="80" alt="Minister of Chance logo" class="photo right" /></a>

Thank you so much for making the "Minister of Chance":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2011/05/update_the_minister_of_chance.html such a phenomenal success! 

We're thrilled to say the series will continue & we are now planning to record Episode 3 this autumn. Meanwhile, please do keep spreading the word... it's perfect for airport delays & sun-loungers!

Dan and I are truly grateful for your support...

Clare Eden
