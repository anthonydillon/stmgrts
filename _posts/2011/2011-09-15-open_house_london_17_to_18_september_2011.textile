Open House London celebrates all that is best about the capital's buildings, places and neighbourhoods. Every September, it gives a unique opportunity to get out and under the skin of London's amazing architecture, with over 700 buildings of all kinds opening their doors to everyone - all for free. This year it takes place over the weekend of 17 and 18 September.  Richmond has 23 unusual or  historic buildings for the public to explore.

With architects homes, eco and retrofit buildings, tours of major regeneration projects, landscape projects, government buildings, historic landmarks and towers, major infrastructure sites and more all available to explore over one weekend, it's a great way to find out how good design makes more liveable cities.

Many properties require advanced booking, so go online now.
