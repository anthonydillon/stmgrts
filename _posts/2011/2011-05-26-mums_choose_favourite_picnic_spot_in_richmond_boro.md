Local survey reveals *Marble Hill Park* is most popular picnic spot in the borough

A survey, organised by local community web site For Sanity's Sake, asked its members (1,850) to vote for their Favourite Family Picnic Spot in the borough of Richmond.

Marble Hill Park won the top spot, with Bushy Park's Woodland Gardens coming a close second. Kew Gardens was in third place and Richmond Park was forth.

On Friday 20<sup>th</sup> May, around 50 parents arrived with their babies, toddlers and teddy bears at Marble Hill Park. They threw down their blankets to celebrate in style with a truly tremendous Teddy Bears Picnic.

It was a case of 'Who Bears Wins' when Teddy Bears and babies descended on Marble Hill Park to celebrate it being voted the 'Number One Picnic Spot' in the borough.

> "We were delighted with the number of babies and bears who came along to picnic with us in the glorious sunshine on Friday in Marble Hill Park. Many Mums put in lots of effort with baking and bringing miniature tea sets. All the rugs were one big patchwork with everyone chatting and making new friends. It was great to see the community getting together and having fun outdoors."
