The London-Surrey Cycle Classic is a dress rehearsal for the London 2012 Cycling Road Race, and is one of the most important pre-Olympic test events taking place. The race will take place along a 140km route from central London to Surrey and back. Starting and finishing at the Mall in central London, world-class cyclists will race through the boroughs of Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, Hammersmith and Fulham, Wandsworth, Richmond and Kingston.

*The event will take place on fully closed roads, meaning that transport will be severely affected in and around the Borough of Richmond.*



h3. Road closures and times

The race will enter the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames at approximately 09:20, from the direction of Upper Richmond Road and Richmond Park and will travel along the following roads, leaving the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames via Hampton Court Bridge.

# Richmond Park (Roehampton Gate to Richmond Gate)
# Star and Garter Hill
# Petersham Road
# Hill Rise
# Bridge Street
# Richmond Bridge
# Richmond Road
# York Street
# King Street
# Cross Deep
# Waldegrave Road
# High Street (Teddington)
# Park Road
# Bushy Park (Chestnut Avenue)
# Hampton Court Road
# Hampton Court Bridge

The road closure period will start from 6:00am, on the morning of the race, with the roads beginning to reopen very soon after 11:30am. This time is necessary to enable barriers to be deployed to protect riders and spectators, steward deployment and to allow for some minor highways works, all crucial for the race.

The race will re-enter the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames en route to central London at Hampton Court Bridge, at approximately 11:00 on the return leg and will utilise the following roads;

# Hampton Court Bridge
# Hampton Court Road
# Kingston Bridge
# Kingston Town Centre (Royal Borough of Kingston)
# Richmond Park (Kingston Gate to Roehampton Gate via Richmond Gate)
# Priory Lane (London Borough of Wandsworth)
# Upper Richmond Road

It is necessary to keep Hampton Court Bridge and Kingston Bridge closed until approximately 15:00 to restrict traffic flow from the Richmond and Twickenham directions. This is due to the race travelling through Kingston town centre on its return and to allow Surrey County Council time to reopen and clear the route within their section.

Unfortunately, Upper Richmond Road and Priory Road (London Borough of Wandsworth) will be closed from 04:00 to 15:00.

Richmond and Bushy Parks will be closed all day. This is the responsibility of The Royal Parks and not the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames.
