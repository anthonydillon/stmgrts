    Last year, over 13,500 local people took the opportunity to have their say about their local areas through the survey run by Richmond Council. That represents 17% of households spread evenly across the borough.
    
    First results from the survey, show that 92 per cent of local people have said they were happy with their local area -- however they did highlight a number of areas that need improving.

Last year, over 13,500 local people took the opportunity to have their say about their local areas through the survey run by Richmond Council. That represents 17% of households spread evenly across the borough.

First results from the survey, show that 92 per cent of local people have said they were happy with their local area -- however they did highlight a number of areas that need improving.

We have now fully analysed all the results and are beginning to understand what
people want for their local area and villages. To help with the next stage, the Council has organised a series of local area planning events across the borough over the next few months where people will be able to get together to decide what they want for their local area.

If you would like to have your say about the area where you live, please come along to your nearest event, which is on the "11<sup>th</sup> June for Twickenham, St Margarets, East Twickenham and Strawberry Hill Villages in the Twickenham Civic Centre foyer from 10am to 4pm":http://stmgrts.org.uk/event/meeting/200705142790.
