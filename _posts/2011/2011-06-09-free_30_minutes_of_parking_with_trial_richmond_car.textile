As part of the Council's fair parking programme, over the next few weeks 10,000 residents in the borough will benefit from 30 minutes' free parking via the free trial Richmond Cards that are being distributed this week.

The trial cards will function between 10 June and 31 August, and allow the holder to receive 30 minutes' free parking at any Council car park or on street bay. They will also trigger 10 per cent discounts on longer stays. The cards are only available to local residents.

The trial cards are intended to grab attention and promote the full Richmond Card which has the same benefits, and a 20 per cent discount for over-75s but which operate permanently once local people register.
