Given the success of our monthly beer tastings, we felt it was time to introduce some of our great wines currently available.  So we've linked up with our two favourite wine suppliers to give you the chance to try 8 different wines from our selection.

This is the perfect opportunity to learn more about wines - the different grape varieties, different regions, how to taste wine and what food accompanies different wines.

We're pleased to be joined by Phil Barnet from Les Caves and Elizabeth Killick from Stratford Wines - both experts in their field.



All of our wines cannot be found in supermarkets, are sourced for their uniqueness, and importantly don't cost the earth.

We also hope to have a local food producer, subject to their availability.

This is a completely free event to attend at our shop in Twickenham on "Thursday 20 October 2011 from 7.30pm until 9.30pm.":http://stmargarets.london/event/event/200705143062

PLEASE NOTE THAT OUR TASTINGS BOOK UP VERY QUICKLY.  YOU ARE ADVISED TO BOOK TODAY!

Email "zeph@realale.com":mailto:zeph@realale.com to book your place.  Bring your friends! You can confirm more than one place, subject to availability.
