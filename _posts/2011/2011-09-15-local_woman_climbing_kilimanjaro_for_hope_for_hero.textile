    Phoebe Armstrong, a true St Margarets girl, who went to Orleans Infants, St Stephens and Orleans Park School is climbing Mount Kilimanjaro with two girlfriends on 20<sup>th</sup> October 2011 to help raise funds for the charity _Help for Heroes_ and she needs our help.  As their leaving date gets nearer, they need a final push to get to their target of &pound;12,000.  So far they have raised an impressive &pound;9,934.94 by standing on the A316 with their Hope for Heros buckets on major rugby days and by having donation pots in the Turks Head Pub.
    
    So if you can, please help the _3 Blondes_ reach their goal.
