    _The Richmond Printmakers group celebrate their first 20 years this year._
    
    An exhibition of past and current members runs at the "Stables Gallery, Orleans House Gallery, Twickenham from 20 January to 20 March 2011":http://stmgrts.org.uk/event/show/200705142702.
    
    Ingrid Alan a very committed tutor at the Shaftsbury Centre at Richmond Adult College founded Richmond Printmakers in 1991. She felt that her talented students needed a showcase for their work who, at that time, were mainly etchers. The group attracted printmakers in other disciplines from outside the college and a lively cohesive body of artists started exhibiting together. Helping with the mechanics of setting up the group was Peter Strachan who was also an experienced member of Greenwich Printmakers.

Sue Ribbans, one of the original members, says;

bq. "The first exhibitions were local, the first in the Old Town Hall Richmond, but soon the Richmond Printmakers could be seen many venues including, in London, the National Theatre and the Barbican."

An application for a National Lottery Grant through the Arts Council of England in 1997 enabled the group to produce a leaflet that has helped to promote and explain the mysteries of printmaking to an interested public.

For eighteen months from 2001 Richmond Printmakers ran a small gallery in Richmond but a hike in rental made the project uneconomic so the group does not have a permanent base but holds several exhibitions a year that are varied in scale and location.

The Richmond Printmakers group continues to thrive but sadly Ingrid Alan and Peter Strachan are no longer with us. Their work, however, can be seen amongst the 60 participating artists 21 of which are current members.
