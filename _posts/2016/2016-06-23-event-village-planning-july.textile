Hundreds of residents, local community groups and businesses have worked together to develop a village plan and planning guidance to maintain and enhance the character of East Twickenham and of St Margarets.

In 2015, the Council invited residents and businesses to have their say on the look and feel of their local area; what they like about where they live, what needs to be maintained and what could be improved. Hundreds of people have taken part in the Village Plan consultation through walkabouts, drop-in sessions, Question Time with the Leader of Richmond Council and our online survey.

We have used your feedback to refresh the Village Plan and produce new Village Planning Guidance that developers and the local planning authority will have to take into account when making decisions on planning applications.

Come along to the launch of your Village Plan and Village Planning Guidance.
