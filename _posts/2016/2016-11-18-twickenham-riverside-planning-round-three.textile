_A more village feel to Twickenham Riverside to be unveiled this week_

New proposals for redeveloping Twickenham Riverside are to be published by the Council - designs which reflect the 'village feel' of the local area

Over the past few months, Richmond Council has been engaging with residents and businesses in Twickenham in order to gather the creative ideas of all those who wish to see a new heart for the area.

This engagement included an exhibition at a pop up shop, opinion survey, community group meetings and a series of seminars/workshops looking at various themes and topics.

Feedback included, more recognition of the current layout of streets and lanes in the area, the importance of parking and access to Eel Pie Island, a development that draws people to and makes more use of the river, and balances more open space with a mix use of buildings.

Three proposals are being published.

From 2pm on 17<sup>th</sup> November until the 16<sup>th</sup> December, residents are invited to have their say on the proposals. The pop-up shop on Church Street will reopen and proposals will be available on the Council website.

Cllr Pamela Fleming, Richmond Council Cabinet Member for Environment, said:

bq.. "Like everybody we want the very best for Twickenham. Indeed, we paused on our plans earlier in the year so we could carry out further engagement on the first concepts we issued.

"Passions have always run high when it comes to schemes for the Riverside. As a result, part of the site has been left to rack and ruin for over thirty years.

"However, we have spent the last few months really listening to what people want. And, we know that the original concept did not, for many, hit the mark.

"We have heard that people want to make Twickenham a destination, they want to draw people down from the town to the riverside. But, most of all we have heard that people want a design that is more in keeping with the local area. A design that reflects the history and style of local residential and business properties.

"I hope that when people see the proposals on Thursday, they can really see how their input has shaped the concepts. And that they are more aligned with their expectations of the site.

"These concepts are not final. There is still a lot of work to do. However, we want to continue to work with residents to finesse one of them into a final design. One that is ready to submit for Planning next year.


"I hope that people will visit the pop-up shop or look at the proposals online and engage with us positively so we can shape the designs into a scheme that will benefit the whole of Twickenham."


p. Following the consultation, one of the proposals will be further developed and further consultation will be carried out in the New Year. Additional studies, including transport assessments and financial viability will also be carried out.

From 2pm on Thursday 17<sup>th</sup> November, the proposals will be available at: "www.richmond.gov.uk/twickenham_rediscovered":http://www.richmond.gov.uk/twickenham_rediscovered

The pop up shop on Church Street will be open on the below times:

Thursday 17<sup>th</sup> November from 2pm - 5pm. Following this the shop will be open every:

* Tuesday / Wednesday and Friday from 11-4pm
* Thursday from 11- 7pm

The shop will also be open on Sunday 27 November from 12-6pm for the Twickenham Christmas event.
