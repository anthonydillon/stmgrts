Actress Samantha Bond to highlight the Holly Lodge Centre's annual Spring lunch on 16 March 2016.

"In conversation with Samantha Bond" will be the centre piece of the annual Holly Lodge Centre Spring Lunch on Wednesday 16 March at Pembroke Lodge in Richmond Park. Supporters of the Centre will have a chance to interact with Samantha about her distinguished career in film, theatre and television. Perhaps best known as Lady Rosamund Painswick in Downton Abbey and Moneypenny in four 007 movies, Samantha also has numerous other credits to her name. Shakespearean roles include "Romeo and Juliet," 'Much Ado about Nothing" and "Macbeth." Among other West End appearances have been in Tom Stoppard's "Arcadia," "Three Tall Women" (with Dame Maggie Smith), "Amy's View" (with Dame Judi Dench), "A Woman of No Importance" and Michael Frayn's "Donkey's Years." She has played numerous television roles most recently including as Angela in "Outnumbered" on the BBC and as Frances Barden in "Home Fires" on ITV.

In addition to enjoying the stories of Samantha Bond, attendees will have the opportunity to peruse the clothing and gift ideas presented in several select stalls from 11:30 am onwards

During a Prosecco reception from 12:15 pm the stunning new Holly Lodge Centre video will be shown -- everyone agrees it is a brilliant encapsulation of the spirit of the Holly Lodge Centre.

A three-course sit-down lunch will be served at 1:00 pm with wine, coffee, mints and a raffle.
