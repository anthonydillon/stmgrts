*Make some noise on Council's latest public consultation*

Residents can have their say on new rules governing the amount of noise property developers can make during construction or the creation of noisy developments such as music venues.

During the planning process, developers must submit their plans to the Council on how they propose to minimise the impact of noise on the local area. Richmond Council is now updating its guidance on what should be considered and would like the views from residents and other stakeholders on the proposals.

The guidance will form part of a formal Council document called the Noise Sensitive and Noise Generating Developments Supplementary Planning Document. This document will be considered by both Planning Officers and Planning Committee when making decisions on planning applications.

Following the consultation, it is hoped that the final SPD will be adopted later this year.

Richmond Council's Cabinet Member for Environment, Cllr Pamela Fleming, said:

> "Noise can have a significant effect on the environment and the health and quality of life enjoyed by individuals and communities. Noise must be considered when new developments may create noise and when new developments would be sensitive to the existing noise conditions."

**Deadline for views is Friday, 11 November 2016**
