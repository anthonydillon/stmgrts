*The future direction and goals of Children's Services are being decided: Have your say*

Share your views on the future direction and goals of Children's Services for the next four years in a consultation launched this week by Richmond Council.

The consultation centres on The Children and Young People's Plan 2017 to 2021 which sets out the goals to be achieved within the next four years. The plan concerns children and young people up to the age of 19 and 25 years of age for care leavers and young people with learning disabilities.

All your views will help the Council develop the Children and Young People's Plan (CYPP) which has been divided into five broad priorities. These include:

-   Keeping children and young people safe and supported at home and school
-   Helping children and young people to be healthy and make good choices about their health
-   Ensuring children and young people enjoy life, do well in school and get involved in activities
-   Helping families before things get too bad
-   Making sure services are right for families and work well

Richmond Council's Cabinet Member for Children and Young People's Services, Cllr Paul Hodgins, said:

> "We want as many residents as possible to have their say on how children's services will be run in Richmond over the next four years. A lot of research has gone into shaping this plan and now it is up to our residents to have their say - don't miss your chance."

Children's Services in Richmond and Kingston are run by Achieving for Children (AfC). The award-winning and nationally recognised organisation is a community interest company that launched in April 2014. It is owned by both Richmond and Kingston councils and delivers children's services across both boroughs. In addition, AfC is working with other local authorities to drive standards.

AfC was established to enable the two authorities to have a greater potential for innovation, improved economies of scale, better opportunities for staff development, leading to a better trained and more stable workforce, as well as reduced management costs.
