[Richmond upon Thames Literature Festival](/directory/art/200610191449) is celebrating its 25<sup>th</sup> birthday in style, hosting a stellar line up of some of today's most thought-provoking novelists, including Sebastian Barry (in conversation with Erica Wagner), Margaret Drabble, Kate Summerscale and Sarah Moss.

Consider your November entertainment sorted with events embracing everything from vampires and gangsters, through to spies, royal princes and the Mitford sisters. Science journalist Jo Marchant will open our eyes to mind-body medicine, whilst best-selling biographer Anne Sebba will discuss the fascinating lives and loves of women in Paris in the 1940s. Weekend events for families include historian Lucy Worsley introducing her first children's book, storytelling and drawing with Axel Scheffler, and a podcast workshop with spoken word artist Polarbear.

As well as this we have writing masterclasses, a poetry evening, film night and performances of Shakespeare's A Merchant of Venice, all held in some of Richmond upon Thames' most inspiring spaces.
