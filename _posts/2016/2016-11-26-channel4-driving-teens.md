*Local parents who constantly ferry their teens round in the car wanted for new channel 4 programme.*

**Taxi of Mum & Dad** is a one-hour programme that uses mini cameras in the car to explore parenting in the family vehicle. At home parents have to compete with technology for their teens' attention and rarely have the opportunity to catch up and connect as a family. But there is one place where no-one can escape - and that is the family car. Parents use the car as a way to catch up on what's going on in their kids' lives - to bond, to gossip, to dispense advice and to have a laugh. Taxi of Mum & Dad will explore the relationships between lots of different families as they drive to and from events, clubs and family visits - providing us with a insightful look into modern parenting and British family life.
