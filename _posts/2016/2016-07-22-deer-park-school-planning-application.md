We are delighted to announce that a planning application for Deer Park School's permanent facilities has been submitted to the Borough of Richmond. As part of a wider development lead by family supermarket Lidl UK at Ryde House, the government have committed investment into the future pupils at Deer Park School with this exciting mixed use development. It will provide a wonderful facility for pupils to learn with the best teachers, enjoy their school days and succeed in an environment that enables a love for learning.

The Head Teacher of Deer Park School, Alison Colenso said:

> "I am delighted that we now have a submitted application for planning for our permanent site. Ryde House is the perfect location for Deer Park to make its home and will mean that we are able to serve the community that so desperately needs new school places".

Deer Park School opened in temporary accommodation opposite Old Deer Park in Richmond Upon Thames in September 2015. The school's name has come to represent so much more than a location and the pupils and parents of the school have already developed a strong bond with the current name. We are looking to build on this identity with the future pupils and parents who are joining us next year and beyond and therefore there are no plans at present to change the name of the school.
