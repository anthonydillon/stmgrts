The Environment Trust for Richmond-upon-Thames has launched a fundraising campaign for its Model Market Garden in Marble Hill Park. Can you help them to continue making the most of an amazing community garden where volunteers and community groups get hands-on experience of making a heritage garden? They need funds to sustain the garden's good work for the next 12 months.

A £10 donation will help towards their goal of £4,500.
