The London Borough of Richmond upon Thames has bestowed a Civic Pride Award of Â£5,000 to enable Turner's House Trust to have its collection of prints, drawings, watercolours and oils professionally catalogued.

This large and fascinating collection, much of which relates to JMW Turner's own work and to that of his contemporaries, was left to the Trust by Professor Harold Livermore, the last owner of Sandycombe Lodge. Professor Livermore's bequest of the house has made all the Trust's projects possible, preserving it for the nation and future generations.

Richmond Council's Cabinet Member for Community and the Voluntary Sector, Cllr Susan Chappell, said: "The Civic Pride Fund offers grants to various deserving local organisations including those maintaining and protecting the Arts. We are delighted to fund Turner's House Trust's cataloguing project. We are aware that there are a number of Turner enthusiasts in the community and are very pleased to be able support this magnificent organisation."

"Thanks to Civic Pride, when Turner's House conservation is complete and reopened to the public, a full professional catalogue will be a valuable resource for teachers and students and will allow interested members of the public to explore the wealth of information, which these works hold," said Catherine Parry-Wingfield, chairman, Turner's House Trust.
