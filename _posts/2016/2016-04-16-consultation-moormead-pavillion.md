The Council has an aspiration for this building to bring it back into use with a focus around a good quality community facility as well as exploring the local interest in a having a basic refreshment facility as well as public toilets that are open during the busiest times of park life.

Following the advertisement of an opportunity to submit expressions of interest late last year the council has now had the opportunity to assess the seven submissions which were received. They offered varying detail and quality and the submissions can be put into 3 previously mooted categories:-

-   Community Caf√© operation
-   Sport focused operation
-   Nursery provision

In addition there was one submission that suggested a complete rethink, and suggested a master plan for the park being developed before considering the future use of a pavilion. However following the assessment it is felt that the focus for the next stage should be on the current pavilion and on its future use rather than taking a master plan approach.

With that in mind we would now like to seek wider input from the community to gauge the interest in the proposed use or a combination of the proposed uses.

Please give us your views [using the online survey](https://consultation.richmond.gov.uk/parks-open-spaces/moormead/consultation). If you need a paper copy of the questionnaire please contact <parks@richmond.gov.uk>

All feedback must be submitted by 3<sup>rd</sup> May 2016 when the consultation closes.
