The youngsters of St Margarets community football club, Moor Mead FC, are one game away from an unbeaten season in their first year in the league.

Playing in the Epsom and Ewell league, the 'Parakeets' have played 14, won 13, drawn 1. Even though they were promoted 4 divisions at the mid season point, their winning form has continued and the 8 and 9 year olds now only need to avoid defeat in their final game on Saturday April 23<sup>rd</sup> to complete a triumphant season.

Head coach Dan Matthews commented, 'Performances matter to us more than results. We want the kids to play good passing football with the ball under control. But naturally, we're delighted with the results the team have had. There are some really talented players and we're really proud of all of them.'

Moor Mead FC was founded by local parents in 2011 and runs teams for 4 to 14 year olds. Each Saturday morning, approximately 200 local children receive free coaching in Moor Mead park, St Margarets. Home games are currently played at Marble Hill Park but the club are actively lobbying LBRUT to take over and refurbish the Moor Mead park pavilion to enable league matches to be played at home.

Moor Mead coach Jonny Bevan emphasises the community philosophy, 'This is a club open to all. Coaching is free and we have kids from 3 local primary schools. We want to help kids to learn about exercise, teamwork, sportsmanship but mainly how much fun they can have. If we can win too, even better, but every child at every level is included.'

Moor Mead U9 defender, Orla McNeany, the side's only girl added, 'This season has been epic. It's our first season and by playing as a team, we've had some great wins.'

Moor Mead Athletic U9s' final league is on April 23<sup>rd</sup> at Marble Hill Park. Kick off time 9.30am.
