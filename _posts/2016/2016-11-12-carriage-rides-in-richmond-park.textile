_What can be more magical than a carriage ride in beautiful Richmond Park?_

This Festive Season, the Royal Parks Foundation has teamed up with Operation Centaur to bring you a six-person Park Brake drawn by our majestic Shire Horses, allowing you to experience Richmond Park like never before.

The 90-minute experience begins at Holly Lodge, Richmond Park, where you'll be met with festive refreshments. You will take your place in the carriage under warm blankets, embarking on a 60 minute ride through the park in all its stark winter beauty! You'll also be treated to a unique behind-the-scenes visit of the working stables.

Proceeds will help fund sustainable conservation initiatives with the working Shire horses in The Royal Parks.
