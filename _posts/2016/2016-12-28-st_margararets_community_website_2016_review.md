    As 2016 comes to a close, we wanted to share some quick stats on the year that's gone by, as we have in 2015 and 2014.

As 2016 comes to a close, we wanted to share some quick stats on the year that has gone by, as we have in [2015](/archives/2015/12/st_margarets_community_website_2015_review.html) and [2014](/archives/2014/12/st_margarets_community_website_2014_review.html). The site has gone through many big changes this year, but not many people will notice, including:

-   a new CMS - now we are using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) moving over from Movable Type
-   a new version control system - [GitHub](https://github.com/pmahnke/stmgrts)
-   a new server - with [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)
-   a new domain name - stmargarets.london over stmgrts.org.uk
-   secure pages - https over http

### Articles and events

This year we wrote fewer articles, but published more events than in previous years.

We also have a Facebook page. Why not [follow us](https://www.facebook.com/stmgrts/?)

#### Usage stats

Perhaps less newsletter means a slight decline in usage over 2015:

|           |         |
|-----------|--------:|
| Sessions  | 63,903  |
| Users     | 47,013  |

### How people accessed the site

<a href="/assets/images/2016/stmgrts-stats-devices_2016.png" title="See larger version of - stmgrts stats devices 2016"><img src="/assets/images/2016/stmgrts-stats-devices_2016_thumb.png" width="250" height="189" alt="stmgrts stats devices 2016" class=" right" /></a>

One trend we have been watching is how many people are now using the site on phones and tablets. This is why we continue making the site work better on smaller screens.

| Device  | Sessions | Change&nbsp;from&nbsp;2015 |
|:--------|---------:|---------------------------:|
| Desktop | 51.78%   | -3.62%                     |
| Mobile  | 33.42%   | +5.52%                     |
| Tablet  | 14.80%   | -1.90%                     |
