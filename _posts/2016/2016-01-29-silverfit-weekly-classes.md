#### About the Silverfit Charity

We're a charity which encourages people to regain or to maintain their lifelong fitness. In addition, we provide opportunities to get active by arranging events and regular local groups. We also provide links to other exercise events of interest.

Our volunteers have all found regular exercise improves many aspects of life, and our team includes sport enthusiasts and health professionals. We are happy to take on new-comers from those just getting into exercise to lapsed athletes.
