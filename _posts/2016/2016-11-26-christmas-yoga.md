If you're looking to buy a slightly different Christmas present this year, Grounded Yoga are offering a 6 week beginners introductory course into yoga starting on Sunday, 8 January 2017.

Running at the ETNA Centre on Rosslyn Road, Amy at Grounded Yoga will introduce some of the key postures regularly practised in yoga, as well as focus on breathing and relaxation. Possibly a good antidote to the Christmas stress?
