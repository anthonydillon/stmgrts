Half Backs is excited to announce that we will be expanding by launching a new session for two to six year olds to enjoy rugby in the Twickenham area. Working in Partnership with Thamesians RFC we will be offering our fun, and active rugby based play sessions on Twickenham Green with the first session on the 11<sup>th</sup> September 2016 at 10am.

Half Backs' aim is to be the physical activity of choice, for children aged two to six, by providing professionally run, safe and educational early years development through rugby union. Our sessions are always in an outdoors setting and we strive to be an active part of the local community.

Thamesians RFC started in 1962 and have had a residence on Twickenham Green for a number of years, although currently they run an adults men's rugby team they have a strong family ethos which will be a great fit for Half Backs.

"We are so excited to be able to grow the Half Backs family in West London and to be able to work with such a great rugby club like Thamesians RFC is the cherry on the cake!" commented Heather Smith Half Backs Director.

At a Half Backs session, you can expect your child to develop teamwork and sportsmanship as well as fundamental movement skills such as running, jumping, passing and catching and kicking. All our sessions are game based and full of fun. Our coaches are all experienced rugby coaches or teachers.

Half Backs also run a session on a Saturday morning in Marble Hill Park near St Margrets, if you would like to sign up for a free trial session at either sight, then visit "www.halfbacks.co.uk/sign-up":http://www.halfbacks.co.uk/sign-up and click on the Book Now button.
