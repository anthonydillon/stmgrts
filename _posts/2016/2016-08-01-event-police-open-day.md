#### WHY NOT TAKE THEM TO THE LOCAL POLICE STATION?

*No. You're can't leave them there. Sorry!*

On Sunday 7<sup>th</sup> August our local Safer Neighbourhood Team are running an Open Day at Twickenham Police Station, 41London Road in Twickenham. There will lots to see and do... Police Dogs, A Crime Scene, Finger Printing, Vintage Police Cars, Free Bicycle marking and units from the RNLI, Fire Brigade and Ambulance Services. Adding to the fun will be live music from local rock 'n' roll specialists 'Nark Drool and the Shudders' and a chance to "Soak a Bobby in the Stocks."

The doors are open from 10.00am to 3.00pm and admission is absolutely free.

Do come. It will be FUN - and you'll be in 'Safer Neighbourhood Hands'!
