Young athletes from St Stephen's Primary on Winchester Road have been celebrating their recent successes in the Richmond Borough Sports competition.  Joining 35 other local schools the children took part in an fantastic day of sporting challenges at St Mary's University.

The St Stephen's pupils, led by sports coach Aaron Downes, had been training hard in the run up to the event and all their hard work and enthusiasm paid off with the children taking the Borough Champion title in the 2 Form Entry schools category.  Other successes included:

* Borough Champions Relay Team
* Borough Champions - Year 6 Team
* Borough Champion - Girl Athlete
* Team 1000 - Borough Champion - Boy Sprint

The Year 6 team are now preparing to represent the Borough in the London Games, Europe's largest youth sports festival, being held in Crystal Palace on Thursday 30 June.

Sports coach Mr Downes said "I'm so proud of the children and what they have achieved.  The team displayed fabulous sportsmanship towards each other and competing schools.  The Year 6 team are looking forward to the next challenge at the London Youth Games and feel really privileged to be able to represent their borough".
