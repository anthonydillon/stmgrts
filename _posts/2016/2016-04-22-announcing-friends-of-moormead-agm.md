<div markdown="1" class="letter">
Dear Friends of Moormead,

I attach [an agenda](/assets/images/2016/Friends_of_Moormead_AGM_agenda_27_April_2016.pdf) Friends of Moormead AGM agenda 27 April 2016.pdf</a> for the Annual General Meeting to be held on 27<sup>th</sup> April 2016 at 7pm in Winchester Hall at the Turk's Head. I also attach the minutes of the last AGM

I hope and trust that the "formal" part of the meeting will take all of 5 minutes. This year, yet again, there is only really one subject for airing your views on and that is the Pavilion.

Through LBRuT we are inviting those who have Expressed an Interest to the Council to give a 3 minute presentation to the meeting. We would like to hear how their plans address :-

1.  Provision of toilets and refreshments
2.  Provision of community space for activities and storage
3.  Impact of refurbished building
4.  Generation of traffic and parking
5.  Sustainability

I realise that this sound like a lot to pack into 3 minutes but that is what Councils allow the public at their meetings.

Please note that this will not be a "beauty contest". If a popular bidder emerged at our AGM this does not mean that LBRuT will automatically adopt that plan. Expressions of Interest have been made, the public can comment on their preferred option and then the negotiations between the bidders and LBRuT start.

We hope to see you on 27<sup>th</sup> April 2016.
