### Art History Lecture Series: Women in Art

<a href="/assets/images/2016/ORLEANS-2016_Art_History_Lectures.jpg" title="See larger version of - Art History Lectures"><img src="/assets/images/2016/ORLEANS-2016_Art_History_Lectures_thumb.jpg" width="250" height="331" alt="Art History Lectures" class="photo right" /></a>

Women have always been involved with making art, despite the fact that they are grossly underrepresented in museums and galleries worldwide. This course will introduce women artists from the Middle Ages to the present, discuss some of the misconceptions about their art, and explore if women in art can be a platform for discussing women's issues.

#### Lecture Timetable

-   Tuesday 14 June: Art about Women & Art by Women
-   Tuesday 21 June: Historical Female Artists you should know
-   Tuesday 28 June: Female Artists during Modern Times, and Artist Couples

Each lecture is a self-contained exploration of a particular period and so can be enjoyed as a standalone session or as part of the series.

#### More Information
