Absolutely no wine expertise is required, and whether you are a complete novice or an experienced taster, there will be plenty to learn and enjoy.

The tastings are hosted by Tim Syrad, who has 25 years experience of running wine tastings, and currently runs the monthly Richmond and Teddington Wine Societies, as well as fine wine Masterclasses. He is a fervent advocate that wine is to be enjoyed without snobbery.

You will be warmly welcomed with a glass of wine. Over our first glass of wine we will learn about wine tasting technique, and quickly put this into practice on a series of six wines, interspersed with a three course dinner. We will explore champagne vs sparkling wine, classic French and Italian wines, and some stunning wines from the New World. We will discover how different wines go with food, and enjoy a superb meal.
