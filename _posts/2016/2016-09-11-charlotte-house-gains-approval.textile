A national care watchdog has given a care home in Isleworth the seal of approval, with relatives and residents praising the home's caring team members

The Care Quality Commission's (CQC) report gave Care UK's Charlotte House care home on Snowy Fielder Waye an overall 'Good' rating, following an unannounced inspection.

To assess service standards at Charlotte House, the CQC's inspector spoke with team members, residents and their visiting relatives on the day of the inspection. They also reviewed the records and procedures already in place at the care home.

According to the inspector's report, residents said they were happy and felt their needs were being met. Resident's preferences and wishes were taken into account when providing care, and they were asked for their opinion about the care they received. The inspector observed how the Care UK team members were kind, polite and caring towards the residents. They were gentle when they approached them, spoke with them positively and showed genuine affection.

The team also supported residents to have positive mealtime experiences. The chef meets with residents when they move to Charlotte House to assess their likes, dislikes and food preferences, and residents said they were supported to stay healthy.

The report highlighted the varied programme of social events and activities, which included visits from musicians, church services and pet therapy sessions. It was also highlighted that the activities coordinator was attentive towards people and made sure they interacted with everybody in their rooms and the communal areas.

The atmosphere at the care home was described as calm, with residents appearing relaxed and comfortable. One resident said: "This is a brilliant home with brilliant staff."

Home manager at Charlotte House, Zoe Smith, said:

bq.. "We strive to create a welcoming home from home at Charlotte House and I'm so pleased our efforts have been recognised by the CQC's inspectors.
