    Once upon a time a Prince made Orleans House his home; he loved books and built a library where he could house his large collection and read in peace. When he left Orleans House for France he took his prized books with him, years later his library was demolished by gravel merchants. Today, the woodland has grown and covered where the library once stood.

Once upon a time a Prince made Orleans House his home; he loved books and built a library where he could house his large collection and read in peace. When he left Orleans House for France he took his prized books with him, years later his library was demolished by gravel merchants. Today, the woodland has grown and covered where the library once stood.

Families are invited to explore the woodland surrounding Orleans House Gallery to uncover the hidden history of the lost library. A professional writer will encourage you to play with words to create your own stories, poems and artworks inspired by the lost library.
