I'm Amy Faulkner of [Grounded Yoga](https://stmargarets.london/directory/health_aNd_beauty/201609041530) and I have been practising yoga for over 15 years - I love how it makes me feel both physically and emotionally and try to convey that through my teaching. Sunday evening is a great time to try a class, to both relax the body and mind but also get your energy levels ready for the week ahead!

I'll be teaching two classes at the beautiful [ETNA Community Centre](https://stmargarets.london/directory/other/201110040733) every Sunday during term time:

-   **6.30 - 7.45pm - beginners/ intermediate Hatha yoga**
    No need to book, just come along! £10 per lesson and every 10<sup>th</sup> lesson is free of charge
-   **7.50 - 9pm - complete beginners course**
    A 6 week course designed to teach you the basics of understanding yoga, introducing you to the asanas (poses) and breathing practices. £65 for the course

*Equipment is provided for both classes, but do bring your own mat if you prefer.*
