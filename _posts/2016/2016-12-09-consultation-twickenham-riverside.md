*One week to go to have your say on future of Twickenham Riverside*

Residents are reminded that there is just one week to go to have their say on the future of Twickenham Riverside.

Over the past three weeks, Richmond Council has been consulting residents and businesses in Twickenham on proposals for a new 'village feel' for the development on King Street / Water Lane and Twickenham Riverside.

This consultation includes an exhibition at a pop-up shop on Church Street and online survey.

The consultation follows engagement over the summer where residents told the Council they wanted to see more recognition of the current layout of streets and lanes in the area, a development that draws people to and celebrates the River, and balances more open, community space with buildings with a mix of uses.

The pop-up shop exhibition is open until Thursday 15<sup>th</sup> December, with the online survey available until midnight on Friday 16<sup>th</sup> December.

Cllr Pamela Fleming, Richmond Council Cabinet Member for Environment, said:

> "So far nearly 1,000 people have visited the exhibition to view our proposals. We are pleased that residents generally seem to think we are heading in the right direction. However, we need everyone to remember to complete the questionnaire, so we can really understand what they like and don't like about each of the proposals presented.
> 
> "We have really worked hard to ensure that resident's thoughts and ideas have been incorporated into the concept designs. And, we know that we will need to do more work to develop the designs.

"I hope that over the final few days of the consultation, even more people will help us on this journey."

Following the consultation, one of the proposals will be developed in more detail and further consultation will be carried out in 2017. Additional studies and technical assessments will also be carried out.

The pop-up shop on Church Street will be open until Thursday 15 December:

-   Tuesday / Wednesday and Friday from 11am to 4pm
-   Thursday from 11am to 7pm
-   Saturday from 11am to 5pm
