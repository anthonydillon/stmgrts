h3. Art Clubs

<a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/assets/images/2016/art_club_autumn_2016.jpg" title="See larger version of - art club autumn 2016"><img src="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/assets/images/2016/art_club_autumn_2016_thumb.jpg" width="250" height="353" alt="art club autumn 2016" class="photo right" /></a>

Exciting weekly workshops offer budding young artists the opportunity to explore a broad range of artistic media and practice with our experienced gallery artists. Each term brings a varied selection of projects which are explored in group sizes of no more than sixteen, allowing participants to try more messy and adventurous media than may be possible at school.

Often taking inspiration from Gallery exhibitions or the work of other artists, our Art Club members benefit from being given creative opportunities in a relaxing and inspiring environment.

Autumn Term Art Clubs take place from the week beginning 12 September until the week beginning 12 December 2016, with a week off for half term on the week beginning 24 October.
