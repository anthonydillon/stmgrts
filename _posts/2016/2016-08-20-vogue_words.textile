    Maybe it's because I am getting old or like Rip Van Winkle I have been asleep for the last twenty years or maybe I'm just thick but something strange seems to be happening to our language.  A whole gabble of words that I have never seen before have recently appeared and left me baffled.

bq. "Lowly words raised to high estate, humdrum terms invested with a picturesque and individual life or not unattractive general currency"

Maybe it's because I am getting old or like Rip Van Winkle I have been asleep for the last twenty years or maybe I'm just thick but something strange seems to be happening to our language.  A whole gabble of words that I have never seen before have recently appeared and left me baffled. Even my trusty English O Level has left me struggling with these apparent newcomers like <em>'meme'</em>,  <em>'dench'</em>, <em>'uber'</em>, <em>'elancer'</em>, and the most ubiquitous of them all - <em>'trope'</em>!

Paul Greengrass the director of the new film <em>"Jason Bourne"</em> used the word <em>'trope'</em> about a dozen times in a 3 minute interview on Radio 4 last week and left none of us any the wiser.

Of course as one grows older we do tend to lose a grip on the modern world and its manifestations - PC's, tablets, GPS, smart phones, apps and similar examples of the programmer's art. When people tell me that these devices are <em>'intuitive'</em> (huh?) and even an eight year old can understand them I feel like rushing out into the streets and asking an eight year old to tell me if I should upgrade to Windows 10 or not. <a href="/assets/images/2016/NEWWORDS_Chief_I-Spy_and_children.jpg" title="See larger version of - Chief I Spy and children"><img src="/assets/images/2016/NEWWORDS_Chief_I-Spy_and_children_thumb.jpg" width="250" height="184" alt="Chief I Spy and children" class="photo right" /></a> The only trouble is the 8 year olds on the streets are now all playing Pok&#233;mon GO - the modern variant of the <em>'I Spy'</em> books that I grew up with in the 1950's. Who remembers <em>'Big Chief I -Spy?"</em>

So what do these <em>'new'</em> words actually mean? To find the answer I used a book.

*TROPE*:- a word, phrase, or image used in a new, non-literal and different way in order to create an artistic effect.

examples:

* <em>'rainy day'</em> - a future time of shortage as in <em>"saving money for a rainy day"</em>
* <em>'blind alley'</em> - unproductive action as in <em>"all the clues led the police into a blind alley"</em>.

*MEME*:- an idea, behaviour, or style that spreads from person to person within a culture  - often proliferated through the internet, E mail and social media.  (Richard Dawkins coined the word meme in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene)

*UBER*:-  Nothing to do with taxis - Uber means <em>'extremely'</em>, 'outstanding', <em>'very'</em> as in <em>"he'</em>s uber-cool" or <em>"she'</em>s uber-attractive". The word is German.

*DENCH*:- Nothing to do with Dame Judy. It means <em>'impressive'</em>, fashionable' or <em>'attractive'</em> or should I say <em>'uber-attractive'</em>.

*ELANCER*:- a person who works from home providing goods or services over the internet

I stumbled upon another newbie this week. 'Frow'. It accompanied a photograph of Sir Philip Green, Ann Wintour, Kate Moss and their trendy chums sitting on <em>'the frow'</em>  (front row) at the Top Shop Fashion Show. Given the company I think that I would have opted for the <em>'brow'</em> so that I could make a quick escape.

Tajikistan, one of central Europe's most repressive states, plans to fine journalists who use <em>"incomprehensible"</em> words in their reports, according to Gavhar Sharifzoda, the head of Tajikistan's state language committee. <em>"There are cases when journalists use as many as 10 words in one day that the simple reader cannot comprehend. This grossly violates the norms of state language"</em> she said. Fines will range from &pound;50 to &pound;75 for individuals up to &pound;150 for state officials and organisations.

Oh no! Another two have just appeared from out of the Olympics. The first was a reference to Jessica Ennis-Hill's <em>'peebee'</em> which I had to think about until I realised that it meant P.B, as is <em>"personal best"</em>. The other was a freshly formed verb - 'to medal'. The context was <em>"Argentina hasn'</em>t medalled yet"..meaning that Argentina hadn't won any medals at the time. I could complain I suppose but I don't want to meddle.
