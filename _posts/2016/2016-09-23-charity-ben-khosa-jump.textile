Local Councillor Ben Khosa is doing a bungee jump in support of the domestic abuse charity Refuge.

Ben says:

bq. "I am doing a 160ft bungee jump with my daughter Reena Dev. I was just going to do it for the hell of it, but I've had a thought, if I'm going to risk my life and limb, it may as well be for a worthy cause."

Please support Ben and Refuge if you can.
