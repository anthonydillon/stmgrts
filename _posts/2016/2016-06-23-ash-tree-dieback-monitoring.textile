_A call for involvement and help from residents to help monitor ash die back across Richmond Borough_

Ash Dieback is a serious threat to ash trees across the UK, including Richmond Borough. The Council is embarking upon a new project to monitor ash dieback and needs your help!  The aim is to identify whether trees are being affected by the disease, and to identify trees that are not being affected and could therefore be resistant - resistant trees may help to sustain a future for Ash trees within the UK.

We are inviting residents to assist with this very simple monitoring process using the "Ash Tag initiative":http://www.ashtag.org - with information feeding into a national database.

If you love trees and can help, please contact us: "hello@swlen.org.uk":mailto:hello@swlen.org.uk
