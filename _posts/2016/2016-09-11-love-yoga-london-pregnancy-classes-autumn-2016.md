I am delighted to announce that a lovely new pregnancy yoga class is now running in the heart of Twickenham, with 'Love Yoga London'

Being a mother of two, and a 'British Wheel of Yoga' teacher, specialising in pregnancy yoga, I have seen and experienced first hand the positive benefits that a yoga practice can bring, both for pregnancy, birth and postnatal recovery afterwards.

Specifically, pregnancy yoga can help with:

-   Common pregnancy conditions such as heartburn, back pain, water retention, cramps, nausea, lack of energy, insomnia, stress
-   Preparation for labour and giving birth. By strengthening body and mind, using breathing and relaxation techniques, Pregnancy Yoga aims to prepare you for labour and to provide a toolbox crammed full of tips and techniques that you can draw upon when you need them most
-   Postnatal recovery and getting back into shape. A physically fit and supple mother is much more likely to recover well and have the stamina to cope with a new born. Pregnancy yoga is a stepping stone to aid recovery.

Spending time in a pregnancy yoga class with other women can also be an emotionally bonding experience and I have seen many friendships formed at this time.

If you would like to try out a class contact Sammie.
