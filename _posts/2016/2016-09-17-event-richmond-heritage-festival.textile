Tickets are still available for the annual 'Know Your Place' Heritage Festival which celebrates Richmond's rich and vibrant history.

Organised by Richmond Council's Library Service, the 'Know Your Place' festival is the annual programme of activities that celebrate the history of the borough throughout September.

The festival is a month long series of workshops, walks, talks and activities and there are also a number of hidden treasure 'trails' around Richmond Town and East Twickenham.

* Talks on Ham in the early 20<sup>th</sup> Century, Twentieth Century Richmond, Richmond Park during both World Wars and Six Tudor Queens.
* Exhibitions include the History of Kew Gardens; Contemporary British Painting Prize and the Life and Works of Lancelot Capability Brown.
