Come hear Vince Cable speaking with Paddy O'Connell about the economic future of Britain at Queen Charlotte Hall, RACC Parkshot on [Tuesday, 9 February 2016 from 7.30pm to 9.00pm](https://stmargarets.london/event/event/200705145366)

Vince Cable was Business Secretary in the 2010-2015 coalition government and MP for Twickenham for 18 years.

His bestselling book, *The Storm*, explored and explained the causes of the 2008 world economic crisis. His new book, *After the Storm*, provides a unique perspective on how the British economy has fared since 2008, how to make improvements in productivity to raise living standards, and how Britain can rebalance its economy and earn its keep in an increasingly uncertain global market.

In conversation with Paddy O'Connell, Vince Cable explores the economic future of Britain and related social and political implications, reflects on lessons learnt and not learnt over the past 5 years and the likely shape of politics 5 years from now.

Paddy O 'Connell presents The Sunday morning magazine programme 'Broadcasting House' on Radio 4. He was formerly North America Business and Wall Street Correspondent for the BBC and anchored the reporting of the September 11 2001 attacks on the World Trade Centre.
