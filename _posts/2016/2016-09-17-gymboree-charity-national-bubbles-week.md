Young visitors to Gymboree St Margarets will be bursting with excitement during National Bubbles Week from 19 to 25 September whilst raising money for Rainbow Trust Children's Charity, which supports families caring for a child with a life threatening or terminal illness.

The fun-packed week will involve lots of special bubble filled sessions for babies, toddlers and children under five years old. There will also be an exciting bubble themed party which will raise as much money as possible for Rainbow Trust.

Both Gymboree and Rainbow Trust are celebrating milestone birthdays in 2016 with Gymboree turning 40 and Rainbow Trust celebrating 30 years of care. Gymboree, the world's foremost provider of children's developmental programmes, has committed all its annual fundraising in 2016 to helping Rainbow Trust.

Gymboree St Margarets Manager Sangeeta Gardiner says:

> "We are really looking forward to hosting National Bubbles Week. Not only will we have great fun with the children attending, but it will also be wonderful knowing that our bubble fun will be raising funds to help Rainbow Trust support more families who are caring for seriously ill children."

Emma Haines, Director of Marketing and Fundraising at Rainbow Trust, says:

> "We are absolutely delighted about our partnership with Gymboree and we want to thank them for helping us raise awareness of Rainbow Trust's work. It's down to the generosity of our supporters that we are able to fund our vital Family Support Workers who help families wherever they need us, to make life a little bit easier."

Rainbow Trust is a national charity offering emotional and practical support for the whole family; from their child's diagnosis, during treatment and, if needed, through bereavement and beyond. It relies almost entirely on voluntary donations and the money raised from events like this help the charity to continue to support families. Just £154 pays for a day's visit from a Family Support Worker and £1,700 is the cost of support for a family with a terminally ill child for a whole year.
