For one day only Rambert School is opening its doors to children for a fun filled family day of dancing.

It will offer a behind the scenes look into the studios and inner workings of one of the UK's oldest professional dance schools. Children from two years upwards will be able to try out free taster dance classes, available all day from 11am until 3pm.

Rambert School is delighted to welcome graduate Bradley Weller as special guest for their Open Day on Saturday 10 September.

Bradley Waller trained at Rambert School, based in St Margarets, Twickenham, before joining the internationally acclaimed all male ballet company, Balletboyz, in 2013.

Bradley Waller is one of four Rambert School alumni dancing with the 10 strong Balletboyz company. Balletboyz performed their latest work, Life, earlier this year at Sadler's Wells and they tour all over the world.

Amanda Britton, Principal and Artistic Director of Rambert School, alumnus of the School and former dancer with Rambert dance company, says:

> "We are really excited to open the School for the day and to share our passion for dance with our local community. Rambert School is a hidden gem in the neighbourhood and we are delighted to be able to give local children the chance to try a dance class for themselves.
> 
>  "It is particularly exciting to welcome back Bradley Waller, one of our former students. His successful dance career began here at Rambert School, when he was approached in his third year to join Balletboyz. Many of our students go on to join some of the top dance companies around the world and it is very inspiring for current students and aspiring students to have a chance meet a professional dancer."
