Richmond's Cycling Vision is: to get more people cycling more often by making cycling easier, safer and more integrated.

The benefits of cycling for health are well known, but they also extend to the wider community - reducing road and public transport congestion, in turn reducing noise, improving air quality and providing health and wellbeing benefits.

The London Borough of Richmond upon Thames has one of the highest proportions of people cycling in London (7% of journeys). However, there is still more that can be done to inspire people to cycle and make it safer for all. So it's important that the borough has a clear plan on how we intend to support and encourage growth in cycling over the next ten years.

Our strategy has three aims to help us meet make our cycling vision a reality:

-   To make cycling journeys safer and easier
-   To develop cycling locally as an everyday option
-   To promote cycling as a safe, fun and healthy way to travel

Whether you cycle or not we would like to hear your views on how we can improve cycling in Richmond borough. Your comments will help us understand what we need to do to get more people cycling.
