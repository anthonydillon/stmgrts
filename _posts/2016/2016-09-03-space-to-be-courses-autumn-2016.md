Space to Be is offering a variety of mindfulness courses, tasters and workshops this autumn. Come along to a mindfulness taster session on 16 September 2016. Meet Andrea and find out how mindfulness can bring more peace, inner harmony, and connection to your life.

Mindfulness is a practice which involves deliberately bringing your awareness to the present moment with acceptance and non-judgement. Research suggests that meditation and awareness training can boost the immune system, significantly reduce stress, improve sleep, bolster creativity, reduce the ruminative thinking that leads to anxiety and depression and improve relationships with loved ones and friends.

Could mindfulness be your path to less stress and greater wellbeing? Come along to the taster session and find out!
