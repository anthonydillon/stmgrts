Twickenham will come alive with free music on Saturday 19 and Sunday 20 November as 'The Streets' hits the town centre with a series of vibrant 'pop-up' musical performances in some unusual locations.

Over the weekend, venues such as St Mary's Church, Harris + Hoole, Waterstones, Church Street Food Hall and The Bear will play host to a number of musical performances.

Performances include: Richmond Youth Jazz Band, a long-running group formed of students from around the borough; The Lesley & Kelvin Christiane Quartet, bringing a classical cocktail of music from 1930s to present day and Richmond Jazz School Group, a unique range of musicians based at Richmond Adult Community College.

As part of the local Literature Festival, there will also be The Gruffalo and Roald Dahl Themed Family Music Workshops, suitable for under7's. These will give the youngest music fans an opportunity to bring their favourite books to life and enjoy making music of their own.

Other performances from national and international artists include:

-   Randolph Matthews, UK-based jazz, soul and ethnic beatbox performer
-   Perhaps Contraption, multi-award winning progressive brass band
-   Allan Harris, Brooklyn-born, Harlem-based vocalist, guitarist
-   Adam Ben Ezra, double-bass phenomenon, multi-instrumentalist
-   Vimala Rowe and John Etheridge, soulful vocal and guitar duo from the UK.

Cllr Meena Bond, Cabinet Member for Arts, said:

> "What a fantastic weekend. There are events in church halls, coffee shops, a book shop, local food hall and a pub. We are really bringing singing and dancing to the streets of Twickenham. I'm really looking forward to it, and hope to see people from across the borough enjoying the free shows."

The Streets is an ambitious and dynamic programme which is part of the EFG London Jazz Festival, these pop-up events are curated by the renowned live music and event producers, Serious, alongside Richmond Council's Arts Service. The programme is bringing high quality music and performance to high streets across seven outer-London boroughs and has been designed to showcase the local streetscape and unlock the potential of high streets, local residents and businesses. The programme of music and performance is touring around London, using the communal space of the high street as its stage.
