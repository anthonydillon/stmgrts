Help set the priorities for the Richmond Community Safety Partnership for April 2016 to March 2017. The Strategic Intelligence Assessment report looks at our performance on a range of crimes over the previous year and helps set the priorities for the coming year.

The Community Safety Partnership has a duty to reduce crime and disorder, substance misuse, anti-social behaviour and reduce reoffending. The partnership is made up of the Council, Police, Fire Service, Community Rehabilitation Company, National Probation Service, Achieving for Children, Richmond Housing Partnership, Safer Neighbourhood Board and Victim Support.

We would like to understand what priorities you think should be set for the partnership and the borough as a whole, as well as the most important issues for you in your local area.

Please watch the video above and/or read the Strategic Intelligence Assessment report or summary below before filling out the survey.

Please "complete the survey online":https://consultation.richmond.gov.uk/community-safety/crime-2016 or if you would like a paper copy please contact us at "consultation@richmond.gov.uk":mailto:consultation@richmond.gov.uk

_The consultation closes on 3 April 2016._
