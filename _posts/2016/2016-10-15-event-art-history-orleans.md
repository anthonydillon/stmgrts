*Hungry for Art History? Why not spend your Tuesday lunchtime at Orleans House Gallery?*

For a Tuesday lunchtime with a difference, why not develop your knowledge of Art History at a series of fascinating weekly lectures being held at Orleans House Gallery?

The Art History Lecture series takes place every Tuesday from 1pm to 2.30pm until November 29 (except Tuesday October 25). This series offers an intensive introduction to the history of Western Art and concentrates specifically on the fine arts.

Sessions will refer to well-known Master Pieces to explain and focus on interesting aspects from different historical moments in the arts. Lessons provide an overview of many of the most important movements in art, its key artists and reference to its historical context.

Richmond Council's Cabinet Member for Arts, Culture and Sport, Cllr Meena Bond, said:

> "Art is tremendously popular with our residents so I have no doubt that our lunchtime art history sessions will be very well attended. Each lecture introduces a series of themes and goes into great depth about a particular work of art. The sessions finish with the chance to participate in informal discussions to enhance your learning and share experiences and opinions. So don't miss out and enrol today!"
