Action on Hearing Loss' annual sponsored walk around Richmond Park- Ramble Round Richmond- taking place on Saturday 7<sup>th</sup> May, starting at Sheen Gate Car Park at 9:30am.

This is a charity challenge event with a difference: whilst 7.4 miles is no easy task, the event will not be about people's fastest times but about having the best time and enjoying the beauty and tranquillity of the park. As the quietest place in London, we think Richmond Park is a place worth celebrating.

The Mayor of Richmond, Councillor Martin Seymour, will be formally opening the walk and people from right across the surrounding communities are attending. It is going to be a wonderful community event and we would love to get more people from the St Margarets area involved. It is a family event so anyone interested is welcome to take part with children, grandparents and even the family dog.

Light refreshments will be provided and we will be sending an electronic photo album to everyone after the event so that they can continue to cherish the memory of what we know will be a wonderful day. There will also be an informal post-walk reception at a nearby pub that people can head to when they finish the walk to celebrate.

With 11 million people in the UK affected by hearing loss, it is a growing problem that is likely to affect all of us or someone we know at some point in life. Hearing Loss can prevent people from living the life they choose and so we, at Action on Hearing Loss, aim to remove the barriers in their way through our care and support services, campaigns for equality and funding of research that we know will lead us to a cure for hearing loss within a generation. Events such as Ramble Round Richmond support the vital work we do and spread awareness about a condition that can so easily go unnoticed.
