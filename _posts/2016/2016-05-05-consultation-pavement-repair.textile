Residents concerned about the state of pavements in their local area can now nominate them for repair until 17 June 2016.

In our local Residents Survey, people highlighted that the condition of pavements was among their top concerns. In response, the Council has made available &pound;500k in 2016/17 specifically to pay for community nominated improvements. This round of funding is now open for residents to nominate pavements they feel are in need of extra work. This is in addition to the regular maintenance work being carried out.

Funding will be directed to pavements that receive the most nominations and fulfil the greatest community need.

For more information and to nominate please go to the "Community Pavements webpage":http://stmargarets.london/l/qenCw
