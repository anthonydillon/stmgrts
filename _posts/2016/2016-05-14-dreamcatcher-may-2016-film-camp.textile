_Make a short film in 5 Days and take a copy home on DVD!_

Here at Dreamcatcher Media, the films made on our Summer Film Camps feature great heroes and anti-heroes, goodies and baddies, exciting chases and dramatic scenes - all scripted, filmed and directed by young people aged 8 - 18.

Our summer 5 day Film Camp starts on 11<sup>th</sup> July. Children come up with their own idea for a film, and then set about shooting, directing and editing it over the five days under expert tuition from industry professionals. It's all great fun but good learning too and young wannabee filmmakers finish the course equipped to make their own movies.

Sponsored by the Alpha Plus Group, the Camp takes place at Falcons Boys Prep School in Richmond and runs for 6 weeks from July 11<sup>th</sup> until August 19<sup>th</sup> starting at 9am. The dates are as follows:


* July 11<sup>th</sup> -  July 15th
* July 18<sup>th</sup> - July 22nd
* July 25<sup>th</sup> - July 29th
* August 1<sup>st</sup> - August 5th
* August 8<sup>th</sup> - August 12th
* August 15<sup>th</sup> to August 19th
