Twickenham vocalist Shelle Luscombe ("www.shelleluscombe.co.uk":http://www.shelleluscombe.co.uk) will be hosting a brand new community sing along group called Vocal TonixTM. The weekly 'sing along and social' sessions launch Wednesday 4<sup>th</sup> May at 1.30pm in Twickenham and Thursday 5<sup>th</sup> May at 1.30pm in East Twickenham.

The therapeutic benefits of singing are widely reported, and singing in a group has been proven time and time again to help combat loneliness and isolation. While the group has been created for older members of the community, absolutely anyone is welcome to come along.

Shelle said: "Singing is such a fantastic tonic for the soul and I wanted to provide an opportunity for people to come together, have a giggle with their friends (old and new) and sing songs they know, just for the fun of it."

Each session will start with a gentle vocal and physical warm up then Shelle will lead the group through a guided sing-along to a selection of well known music dating back through the years. Attendees can request favourite songs for future sessions at any time.

Vocal Tonix is for people who want to sing regularly but can't necessarily read music and don't want the pressure of joining a choir. The lyrics will be projected onto a screen at the front of the room so that everyone can hold their heads high and let their voices ring (even if they're not in tune!).

h4. Venues:

* Wednesdays 1.30-3.30pm Methodist Church, Queens Road, Twickenham TW1 4EU
* Thursdays 1.30-3.30pm ETNA Community Centre, 13 Rosslyn Road, East Twickenham TW1 2AR

A session lasts two hours, including an all-important break for tea, cake and a catch up. The cost is &pound;8 for two hours. There's no membership fee and no need to pre-book so people can just turn up and pay on the door.
