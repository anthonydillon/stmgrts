    On Saturday 16 January 2016, hundreds of St Margarets residents braved freezing temperatures to show their support for the renovation of Moormead Park Pavilion.

    Parents from Moormead Football Club are waiting to hear back from Richmond Council about their community-led 'expression of interest' to restore the Pavilion building, which was submitted in December last year.

On Saturday 16 January 2016, hundreds of St Margarets residents braved freezing temperatures to show their support for the renovation of Moormead Park Pavilion.

Parents from Moormead Football Club are waiting to hear back from Richmond Council about their community-led 'expression of interest' to restore the Pavilion building, which was submitted in December last year.

Gariesh Sharma, an Orleans Primary School parent leading this community bid said:

bq. "Moormead Park Pavilion should be properly restored, so that it can return to the heart of the community. The building is in desperate need of repair, we can help raise money to do this."

For over a century, Moormead Park has been a highly used and valued community space in St Margarets. Today, local residents train and play sport in the park, including the 150 children from Moormead Football Club, who turn out every Saturday morning.

The community bid has scope to provide working toilets and changing facilities in the Pavilion, which are both currently in a state of disrepair. The bid team would consider linking up with a commercial partner to offer hot and cold refreshments during sociable hours, in keeping with the serenity of Moormead Park.

Local charity Brentford FC Community Sports Trust has been providing help and support to the community bid.

Lee Doyle, Chief Executive of the Trust said:

bq.. "What a fantastic turnout! The energy and enthusiasm shown by the participants, parents and club volunteers sum up Moormead FC. We are fully behind this regeneration project and have provided advice in respect of facility development as well as providing practical coaching and fundraising through Brentford FC match tickets.

"Today we have also seen other clubs and organised groups of a range of ages make use of the local park. An improved changing and refreshments area could be designed with versatility to become a sustainable, vibrant hub in the community."
