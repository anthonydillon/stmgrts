_Have your say on scheme that aims to reduce the risk of flooding._

Residents in Teddington, Hampton and Hampton Wick who could be affected by a new scheme that aims to reduce the risk of flooding, can share their views with the Environment Agency at an event next week.

The Environment Agency is working with local councils along the Thames, including Richmond Council, to design a scheme that will improve resilience to flooding.

A drop in session has been organised on the 22 March at the Tamesis Club in Teddington (Trowlock Way). For more information go to "www.gov.uk":https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/river-thames-scheme
