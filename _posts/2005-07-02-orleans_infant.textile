The "Orleans Infant School Fair":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/cgi-bin/events.cgi?key=200505131056&action=getevent was this Saturday afternoon and was clearly a big success, specially compared with last years near wash-out.  Everyone seemed to be having a great day out and enjoying all the food and games.

Congratulations to Orleans and FOOI (the PTA)!
