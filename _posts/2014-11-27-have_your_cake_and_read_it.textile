Children from St Stephen's Primary School in St Margarets have been demonstrating their phenomenal baking skills with a <em>'Bake for Books'</em> event to raise funds to buy books for a new in school literacy programme.

Each year group was given a different challenge including gingerbread, cookies, sweets and treats, cupcakes and a <em>'technical challenge'</em> for Year Six pupils.  The difficult job of judging the amazing entries went to local chefs, artists and key business sponsors.



Judge and sponsor of the event Kenneth Maguire from The Turks Head said <em>"What a wonderful day with an incredible selection of cakes. I was amazed. Very creative children and it was an absolute pleasure to be part of the event and help support St Stephen's."</em>

Liz Stubbs, Headteacher at St Stephen's said <em>"We are always impressed at the amount of time and effort the children put into their creations. This year their baking efforts are going to help us launch our new literacy programme which we hope will really boost the children's love of reading."</em>

Jess Morrison the schools Literacy Co-ordinator added <em>"The new national curriculum for primary schools puts great emphasis on developing a lifelong love of reading and our new reading programme along with other initiatives, such as our new book club for Year Six children, are giving us new and exciting ways to deliver the new curriculum."</em>
