Stop and smell the roses, laze on the luscious lawn and enjoy tea and delectable cakes at the Orange Tree Theatre's Garden Tea Party. The annual fundraising event returns to the beautiful gardens of the Grade 1 listed Trumpeters' House on "Sunday, 5<sup>th</sup> June from 2.30 pm":http://stmgrts.org.uk/event/event/200705142753.

This grand house and gardens stand between the River Thames and Richmond Green on the site previously occupied by Richmond Palace.
