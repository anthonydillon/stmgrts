Young people from Grey Court School are demonstrating their creative skills next month at an exhibition celebrating historical transport posters of the borough.

Twenty three year nine pupils worked with artists Rachel Craddock and Eleanor Pile to create their homages to train and tube posters. Their work will be displayed alongside historical posters from the London Transport Museum as part of the Transported: Posters for the Arcadian Thames exhibition at the Riverside Gallery from March.

The project was made possible by the "Thames Landscape Strategy":http://www.thames-landscape-strategy.org.uk/.


Cllr Pamela Fleming, Cabinet Member for Committees on Richmond Council, said:

bq.. "The introduction of overground and underground trains in the 19<sup>th</sup> century made areas such as Richmond much more accessible to tourists and the rest of London. These posters were created by leading artists of the day, to celebrate our grand historic houses and picturesque gardens, all within easy reach of the metropolis.

"Their posters celebrate many different styles of art, including cubism, futurism, vorticism and abstraction. The young people from Grey Court School have studied the styles and created their own contemporary interpretations, celebrating the local area. The exhibition will definitely be worth a visit."

p. Jason Debney, Co-ordinator of the Thames Landscape Strategy, added:

bq. "The Arcadian Thames is one of the most special landscapes in the country and is brought vividly to life through the London Transport posters. The exhibition includes some quite magical images of Hampton Court, Kew Gardens, Kingston, Twickenham and Richmond and is timed to encourage as many people as possible to get out and enjoy the river this spring."
