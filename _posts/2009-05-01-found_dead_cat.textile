I found a black cat dead on Crown Road (just opposite the junction with Claremont Road) at around 10.45pm on Tuesday night. I obviously would like to let the owners know if possible that their cat has unfortunately died, and that it did not appear to be badly injured so I hope it died relatively painlessly. It had a blue flea collar with a bell on, but no ID tags. I have disposed of the body to prevent foxes mutilating it.

_If you are the owner of the cat and want to get in touch with Kim, please email this site at "editor@stmgrts.org.uk":mailto:editor@stmgrts.org.uk and I will put you in touch._
