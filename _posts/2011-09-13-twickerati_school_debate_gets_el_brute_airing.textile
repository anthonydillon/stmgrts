    The big debate about a revolution in Borough schooling will not be televised. True, but you will be able to see it on a webcast via El Brute's site tonight. And it's not really a revolutionary debate either. More of an airing in the 'chamber of secrets' at York House. You're now thinking, "That made no sense whatsoever". You could well have a point. No, you DO have a point.
    
    So, to summarise where we are in the great Roman Catholic secondary school debate, coz that's what we're talking about...
