Hatha yoga is 5,000 years old. It is non-competitive and it teaches us self-discipline and self-awareness.

Yoga helps to:

* Support the body's systems (endocrine, immune, respiratory, circulatory etc)
* Strengthen and lengthen muscles
* Improve posture
* Focus the mind in the present, offering a relief from every day stresses and strains

h3. About Hatha Yoga

I teach "hatha yoga":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/directory/health_aNd_beauty/200703081619. My classes include preparatory movements, postures (asanas), breathing techniques (including pranayama) and relaxation. I vary my classes each week.

I focus on alignment and breathing, in order to help release tension in the mind and body and to help student's develop greater body intelligence. I put emphasis on the connection between body and breath, rather than advanced posture work and speed.
