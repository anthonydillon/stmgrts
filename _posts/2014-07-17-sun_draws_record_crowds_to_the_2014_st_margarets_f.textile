_Soaring temperatures and sunshine meant the event enjoyed its biggest ever attendance._

Visitors were treated to a full day of attractions and activities including a local schools' 5-a-side football tournament, dance, a dog show (pictured), tennis taster lessons, a karate display and karting.

The all-day live music programme included the St Margarets Elastic Band, the Richmond Music Trust Soul Band (pictured), Speakeazy, West London Brass, Twickenham Operatic Society, rock n' roll band Nark Drool & The Shudders and Americana 60s and 70s band The Deputies.

Stalls were an eclectic mix of charity, craft, local community and fashion.

Food and drink featured strongly and included an Indian Street Food stall in aid of Indian medical charity Impact's hospital train, a Pimms stall organised by the fair and run by Orleans Park School as well as the ever popular beer and tea tents.

For younger visitors there were fun rides, bouncy castles, candyfloss and chance to meet Quins mascot Harley Bear.

As ever, proceeds from the Fair support local causes which this year include Richmond Homes and Lifestyle Trust which supports people with a learning disability in the borough of Richmond, Off the Record, a walk-in information, counselling and sexual health service for 11-24 year olds in Richmond and HANDS which supports local volunteers who help help local people of any age group, especially older, frail, disabled, sick and lonely people.
