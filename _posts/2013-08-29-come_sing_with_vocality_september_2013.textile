_Why not try some singing this autumn?_

Vocality Singing's unusual repertoire of uplifting harmony songs from around the world will help to brighten your evenings this autumn.

Suitable for anyone who loves to sing, Vocality is a fun and friendly choir which meets on Tuesdays 8.00-10.00pm at St Mary's Junior School on Richmond Road, starting again this term from 10 September.

There are no auditions and as everything is learned by ear, no need to read music. We encourage people to try different parts if they wish, and provide all the material so you can practice at home. Songs are chosen from a wide range of genres - folk, jazz, gospel, ethnic, classic pop and even the odd drinking song! - to raise the spirits.

We have a great bunch of people of all ages and from all walks of life and warmly welcome new members. Come and give us a try with a free taster session.
