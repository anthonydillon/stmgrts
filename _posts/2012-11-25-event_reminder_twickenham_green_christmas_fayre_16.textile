excerpt: |
    The Christmas Fayre will happen on "Sunday 16<sup>th</sup> December from 5pm":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/event/fair/200705143692. Its purpose is to bring the Twickenham community together to celebrate Christmas at the Green. There will be lots of mulled wine, mince pies and roast chestnuts available, music and carols as well as the Salvation Army band and a carol procession involving the local churches. There will be plenty for kids including traditional fairground rides, and the opportunity to have a ride on Santas sleigh (with actual Reindeers). We will have a bar and stalls and also... we are able to guarantee snow! The tree lights will be turned on at 5.45 by Rob Brydon - we hope to see as many people there as possible.
