Christopher May said:

bq. "Two hundred years ago games of football were traditionally played on Shrove Tuesday though the main streets of Richmond, Twickenham, Mortlake, Kingston and other places nearby. This was not football as we know it today with its marked out pitch, its limited number of players and its set of rules -- both soccer and then rugby only got their rules half a century later. Shrovetide football was unruly, rough and tumble, boisterous and drunken. The gentry thought it uncivilised; shopkeepers deplored the damage and the loss of business; so the local authorities tried it suppress it, but it would take them several decades and changes in the law and policing for them to kill the game and stop the labouring classes taking over the town for one day of carnival every year."



The Society is covering a wide range of subjects in its autumn and winter programme Â­including a talk on 11 November, by David Hassard of the Kingston Aviation Centenary Project, on "the "temporary" National Aircraft Factory":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/event/event/200705144177 built in Ham by the Ministry of Munitions in 1917/18 and subsequently used by Sopwith Aviation, Leyland Motors, Hawker Aircraft and British Aerospace to produce thousands of aircraft and other vehicles until 1992.
