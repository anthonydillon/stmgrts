"_2pm Sunday, 9 October at Kew Gardens_":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/event/event/200705142931

October/November is the perfect time to prepare your garden so that you can help wildlife to get through the winter and thrive in spring.

The loss of rural hedgerows and wetlands has made town gardens increasingly important to Britain's wildlife. Simple things can make all the difference between a healthy habitat and a lifeless no-go area.

This afternoon of short talks and question sessions at Kew will offer practical advice about the things you can do now to help birds and other small creatures in your garden. There will also be the opportunity to take part in a new survey of local garden biodiversity.
