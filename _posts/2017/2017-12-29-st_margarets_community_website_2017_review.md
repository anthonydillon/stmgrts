As 2017 comes to a close, we wanted to share some quick stats on the year that has gone by, as we have in [2016](/archives/2016/12/st_margarets_community_website_2016_review.html), [2015](/archives/2015/12/st_margarets_community_website_2015_review.html) and [2014](/archives/2014/12/st_margarets_community_website_2014_review.html). The site has gone through many big changes this year, but not many people will notice, including:

- Migrated to markdown for posts, fixed lots of missing images
- Added recaptcha to catch comment spam
- Changed to sentence case titles (I have been living in the UK that long, it was time to change)

### Articles and events

This year we wrote more articles, but published fewer events than in previous years.

### How people accessed the site

One trend we have been watching is how many people are now using the site on phones and tablets. This is why we continue making the site work better on smaller screens.

| Device  | Sessions | Change&nbsp;from&nbsp;2016 |
|:--------|---------:|---------------------------:|
| Desktop | 43.72%   | -8.06%                     |
| Mobile  | 41.1%    | +7.68%                     |
| Tablet  | 15.19%   | +0.39%                     |
