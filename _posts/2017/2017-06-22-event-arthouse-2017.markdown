_Artists open their studios for unique exhibition_

Starting this weekend, hundreds of local artists will open their doors and invite you to take a look around their homes, studios, galleries and gardens!

The Richmond Art House Open Studios Exhibition on the 23 to 25 June and 30 June to 2 July, will showcase a wide range of artwork and creative talent from the borough's artists, including printmaking, photography, wood sculpture and ceramics.

Every year Richmond's Art House festival continues to grow, with hundreds of local artists opening their doors to the public, celebrating their work and joining together to showcase the creative community within the borough!

Not only is it a wonderful way to explore the area but also a rare opportunity to meet and chat to artists about their work. There will also be demonstrations and a varied selection of workshops on offer.

All Art House venues are free to visit on both weekends. Visit five or more Art House venues and attendees can enter into a prize draw to win &pound;100 to spend with an Art House artist of their choosing. Simply fill in and return the form on the back of the official brochure.

Cllr Meena Bond, Richmond Council Cabinet Member for Arts and Culture, said:

> "Once again the ARThouse open studios festival will allow local artists to open their homes and studios so the public can enjoy private exhibitions in very unique and in some cases unusual environments.


> "The festival is the best opportunity to see the extraordinary variety of artwork produced in the borough; with the added incentive of seeing it in the space it was created. Professional artists, budding enthusiasts and school children are all contributing, so there will be something for everyone."
