Users of the outdoor pool at Pools on the Park in Richmond will be able to benefit from increased opening times over the winter months as the popularity of outdoor swimming flourishes in the borough.

From Monday 5<sup>th</sup> February 2018 the pool will be open from 6.30am to 11.00am, Monday to Friday, and from 7.00am to 2.00pm on a Saturday and Sunday. In response to customer feedback, Pools on the Park has  invested in a greater number of staff  to ensure the pool can open for extra hours during the winter season.

Cllr David Linnette, Cabinet member for Culture, Sport and the Voluntary Sector said:

> "Pools on the Park is proving to be more popular than ever. With increased demand and popularity we have chosen to keep the outdoor pool open for longer and longer over the last few years. Responding to the growth in popularity of our outdoor pool we have recruited more staff so we are now able to open the pool more often over the winter period.

> "Swimmers can now use the pool on weekday mornings and for even longer on weekends. I'm sure the decision to extend opening hours will be well received by all users of the pool."
