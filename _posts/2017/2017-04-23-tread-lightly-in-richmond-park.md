To help protect the Park's rich, peaceful and natural environment, Sir David calls on visitors to <em>"Tread Lightly in Richmond Park - leave nothing behind, take nothing away and respect the wildlife."</em>

He then describes the simple things, that people can do to help protect the Park and its wildlife so that "Richmond Park will remain a paradise for us, our children and our grandchildren to enjoy for many centuries to come".

This is how visitors can tread lightly and keep Richmond Park the special place it is:

-   Please don't take wildflowers, nuts, acorns and fungi - all are essential food for birds, bees and deer
-   Fallen wood is home to many insects. Please leave it where it is.
-   Take home all your litter or put it in bins provided so deer don't eat it - it can seriously harm them
-   Clear up after your dog - it damages the fragile soil structure for wildflowers
-   Give deer plenty of room, especially during birthing and the rut - the deer are wild and people should not get within 50 metres of them
-   Keep your dog on a lead in sensitive areas and near animals - dogs off leads may attack and even kill fawns
-   If you're on foot, stay on established paths and away from the anthills
-   If you're on a bike stay to the roads and bike trail (due to erosion, cross-country cycling is forbidden)
-   Please, never light fires or barbecues
