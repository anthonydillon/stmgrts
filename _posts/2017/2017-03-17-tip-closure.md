*Townmead Road Household Re-use and Recycling Centre is set for an upgrade and will be closed for five days at the end of this month.*

The planned improvements include the resurfacing of the site in Kew which will be closed from Monday, 27 March to Friday, 31 March 2017. The site will reopen on Saturday, 1 April 2017. During this period of closure, alternative Household Waste and Recycling Centres will be open in Ealing, Hounslow (Monday-Friday), Greenford and Hillingdon. The centre in Hounslow will only be available for trade.

Richmond Council's Cabinet Member for Environment, Cllr Pamela Fleming, said:

> "Thank you to everyone who uses the recycling facilities at Townmead Road. Many of you will remember the major improvements carried out in 2014 when it was closed for 5 weeks. This time we are looking at 5 days and if we could carry out these improvements without closing the site we would. However, given the nature of the work - mainly resurfacing - it's just not possible to complete the work safely whilst keeping it open to the public. We are endeavouring to keep the closure to a minimum and the intention is to reopen it on 1<sup>st</sup> April. "
