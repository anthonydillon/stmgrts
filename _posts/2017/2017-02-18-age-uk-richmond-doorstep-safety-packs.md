Age UK Richmond upon Thames are working in partnership with the Safer Neighbourhood Team and Trading Standards to help keep you safer from doorstep crime. We want to give you the confidence to say 'no' to cold calling traders on your doorstep. We've put together a Doorstep Safety Pack which contains anti-cold caller door stickers to deter rogue callers and to remind you if unsure, don't open the door. We cannot guarantee that by displaying the sticker you will not get visits from cold callers, however we do believe that you have the right to choose not to be disturbed by these visits.

We are also offering free supply and fitting of a range of doorstep security devices, including:

-   Security Chains
-   Letter box visors
-   Spyholes (wooden doors only)
-   Door mirrors

If you would like a Doorstep Safety Pack and you are interested in having any of these devices fitted free of charge, please call our Handyperson Service on 020 8876 0620.

We also offer a friendly, reliable Gardening and Housekeeping Service to help people remain independent for longer in their own homes. Get in touch to see how we can help.
