Its purpose is to encourage children to think about their virtues or qualities of the heart and more importantly how they can be translated into action.

Could the exploration and application of virtues; e.g compassion, kindness, patience, justice and truthfulness empower our children to make a difference?

If our children were to "possess a pure, kindly and radiant heart" how might this contribute to a happier home, school and neighbourhood?

We are living at a time when kindness and compassion are needed more than ever. We need to empower our children to make use of these inner qualities for the betterment of their world. The camp allows for this by connecting children in the neighbourhood and creating a space where they can really consider these questions.

Please bring your children along with their friends.
