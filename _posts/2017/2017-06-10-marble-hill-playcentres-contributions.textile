Marble Hill Playcentres are staging an exhibition this summer, exploring their 40-year history through interviews, photographs and film. Staff and children at the playcentres are looking for people to contribute their memories of the adventure playground - from its opening in 1975 to the present day.

Current and former users, parents, playworkers and supporters connected to the Marble Hill Playcentres are invited to participate by offering stories and materials for inclusion in the archive exhibition. Marble Hill are running sharing days on Saturdays 24 June and 29 July, where visitors can enjoy a BBQ, look through photographs and take part in recorded interviews led by children.

Playcentre Manager Kevin Stinton says:

bq. "Marble Hill Playcentres have been a site of adventure, risk and fun for generations of children and young people in the local area. Children of adults who attended as kids in the 70s and 80s are now regulars themselves. We've even heard anecdotes about people meeting their future spouses at Marble Hill! The playground has always benefited from loyal support, and when threatened with closure 17 years ago, parents and children came out in protest and saved the site. This archive project is an opportunity to capture this colourful history and highlight changing cultures of outdoor play in Twickenham and Richmond."


People of all ages who are interested in contributing to the archive project or being interviewed about their experiences are welcome to attend the sharing days. Please note that photography and recording will be taking place throughout. There are other ways to submit material and stories if you can't attend the sharing days. Please contact Kevin at "info@marblehillplaycentres.com":mailto:info@marblehillplaycentres.com for more information.

The exhibition opens on 23 August at Marble Hill Playcentres and runs until 16 September 2017.

This archive project and exhibition is supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund.
