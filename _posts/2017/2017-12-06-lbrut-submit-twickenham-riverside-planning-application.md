A Planning Application to redevelop Twickenham Riverside has been submitted and will be open to statutory consultation.

Over the past two years the Council has been consulting with residents and businesses in Twickenham on proposals for a new development on King Street / Water Lane and Twickenham Riverside. The development site includes three properties on the corner of King Street and Water Lane, the car park to the rear and the derelict former swimming pool buildings.

The designs submitted have been developed using resident feedback and include two buildings - one on the riverside and one on King Street, stretching down Water Lane. It is proposed that the ground floor of each building would be a mixture of replacement retail, business and community space, with the upper floors providing 39 residential flats (including affordable housing).

The development proposals also include significant open space, which has been designed to complement Diamond Jubilee Gardens, provide a space for community activities, and draw people down to the river.

For more information please see the [Council's Planning pages](http://www2.richmond.gov.uk/PlanData2/Planning_CaseNo.aspx?strAppNo=P02H3AKALQE00).

It is hoped that the Application will be considered by the Planning Committee in March 2018.

At the same time as this process, the Council is reviewing the findings of a wider Twickenham parking study to understand the current and future demand for parking in the area. This will result in a future proposal on how parking may be further reduced on the Embankment. This work is separate to the Planning Application.
