The Gruffalo and his famous friends will be returning to Twickenham this Christmas to bring some winter cheer!

On the 26<sup>th</sup> November, the well-known children's illustrator will be hosting a live show at the award winning Diamond Jubilee Gardens in Twickenham.

Organised by the Twickenham Riverside Trust the shows will take place at 2pm, 3.30pm and 5pm, with reading, drawing and book signings.

Attendees will be able to take a ride on the Santa Train, play in the 'snow', and browse the bookshop.

The day will also include a chance to meet The Ugly Five, the lovable African animals from Scheffler and Julia Donaldson's new book, and with a special appearance by the Gruffalo, straight form his Riverside den.

Edward Davies, Chair of the Twickenham Riverside Trust, said:

> "The Twickenham Riverside Trust is enormously grateful to yet again welcome Axel Scheffler and the Gruffalo to the Diamond Jubilee Gardens.
> 
> 
>  "This is our gala event of the year, attracting hundreds of children who take part in the day's free shows and activities. It's a great way to kick off Christmas in Twickenham, and we thank the RFU, Try Twickenham and Richmond Literature Festival for their involvement in making this annual event such an on-going success!"

 Cllr Pamela Fleming, Joint Deputy Leader and Cabinet Member for Environment, Business and Community said:

> "Christmas is a magical time of year, especially for children, and it's great to get the festivities up and running at this beautiful location.
> 
> "This will be a fabulously fun day out with lots of activities for people to enjoy. I want to thank the Twickenham Riverside Trust for organising this event and I hope people come out and support it."
