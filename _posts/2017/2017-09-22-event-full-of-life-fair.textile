_Full programme on offer at Fair for older residents_

The Full of Life Fair is coming to town again on Friday 6 October and registration is now open. The free annual event aims to enhance digital skills and promote healthy and independent living, tackling isolation and loneliness open for residents over 55.

A showcase of the huge range of services and activities available, the Full of Life Fair is one not to miss! This year's event is set to be bigger and better than ever before with over 75 stalls from organisations such as: Richmond Furniture Scheme, Embracing Age, Careline, and the Richmond Card.

The fair offers residents the chance to get advice, try activities such as singing and line dancing as well as listen to talks and a number of arts and crafts sessions ranging from painting to making the most of digital devices like tablets and smart phones. Attendees will also be able to have lunch and a free caf&#233; will be open all day. In the afternoon residents can join in the Tea Dance.

The fair will take place on Friday 6 October 2017 from 10am to 4pm at the Rose Suite, Twickenham Rugby Stadium.

Cllr David Marlow, Richmond Council Cabinet Member for Adult Services and Health, said:

bq.. "Richmond is proud of the work it does to support our older residents. Tackling loneliness and isolation is one of the key priorities and the Full of Life Fair is just part of the Council's work in this area.

"Older people who come along to the fair will be able to get helpful tips and advice to improve their lifestyles and wellbeing, so that they can enjoy a happy, healthy and safe retirement.

"This year's event will be just as popular as ever so I urge as many residents as possible to join in and register now!"

p. Registration is essential if you are attending between 10am - 12:30pm.

Shuttle bus services will also be available from Twickenham all day.
