An exhibition of colourful 3D iconography which offers a 'doorway to worlds beyond' is being exhibited in the Riverside Gallery.

The Gallery in Richmond Old Town Hall is hosting a solo show by artist Ian Butcher who turns flat images into illusory 3D artworks.

As a unique approach to collage making, images are manipulated to give high colour and interesting texture and are printed onto matte art paper before being skillfully cut and layered to create fascinating three-dimensional illusions.

With bold vibrant colours, Mr Butcher's unique work is heavily inspired by his travels, including religious sites and temples.

The pieces are presented in perspex boxes to add depth to the images which he says he "teases into three dimensional cut out elements, raised from the surface".

Cllr Meena Bond, Richmond Council Cabinet Member for Art, said:

bq.. "What a unique exhibition! Mr Butcher takes simple two-dimensional pictures and transforms them into a 3D masterpiece.

"I am looking forward to seeing more of his work and encourage others to attend yet another fantastic exhibition at the Riverside Gallery."
