Twickenham has been designated one of the country's 100 most important historical places. Not, as you would expect from Hampton Court Palace or Marble Hill House or even the Turner House, but because of the Twickenham rugby stadium.

The stadium is classified with nine other places (including Wimbledon All England Club, Lords, Aintree, Blackpool Tower Ballroom, The Crucible in Sheffield) as of major historical interest, as a sporting venue  that is now approaching 110 years old.

Vince Cable said:

> "The rugby stadium is the face of Twickenham in the same way as Wembley, Wimbledon, Trafford and St Andrews have come to be defined by their sport."
