It's that time of year again as we look towards summer and the film camp. As always the setting is the Falcons Prep. The films made on our Summer Film Camps feature great heroes and anti-heroes, goodies and baddies, exciting chases and dramatic scenes - all scripted, filmed and directed by young people aged 8 - 18.

Our summer 5 day Film Camp starts on Monday 10<sup>th</sup> July.

Children come up with their own idea for a film, and then set about shooting, directing and editing it over the five days under expert tuition from industry professionals. Each child gets to play all the different roles from actor to director and editor. It's all great fun but good learning too and young wannabee filmmakers finish the course equipped to make their own movies.

Sponsored by the Alpha Plus Group, the Camp takes place at Falcons Boys Prep School in Richmond and runs for 5 weeks from July 10<sup>th</sup> until August 11<sup>th</sup> starting at 9am.

The dates are as follows -

-   July 10<sup>th</sup> to July 14th
-   July 17<sup>th</sup> to July 21st
-   July 24<sup>th</sup> to July 28th
-   July 31<sup>st</sup> to August 4th
-   August 7<sup>th</sup> to August 11th
