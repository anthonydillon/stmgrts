Richmond Council is encouraging any local residents who live in Richmond upon Thames to check they are registered to vote in the General Election on the 8 June 2017.

There are only 45 days until voters go to the polls to elect Members of Parliament for Richmond Park and Twickenham constituencies.

Any residents in either constituency not already registered to vote must do so by 22 May. The final deadline to register to vote by post should reach the Council by 5pm on Tuesday 23 May. New applications to vote by proxy must be received by 5pm on Wednesday 31 May.

Poll cards will be delivered to all eligible registered voters in May.  These will provide information and a map showing which local polling station they should use. Voters will also be able to check the location of their polling station on the council's website nearer the time.  Polling stations will be open from 7am to 10pm on polling day.

Mark Maidment, Acting Returning Officer, said:


> "Anyone not yet registered to vote should do so as soon as possible in order for them to be sure that they will be able to vote in this election. Residents should remember that they must re-register to vote every time they change address. Even if you pay Council Tax, you're not automatically registered to vote.  It only takes a few minutes to do it online now."
