*Have your say on planning guidelines for Old Deer Park, Richmond*

Residents are invited to have their say on the development of planning guidelines for Old Deer Park in Richmond.

The Council has been working with residents, businesses, community groups and organisations to help create planning guidelines for the Old Deer Park Conservation Area and has now prepared a draft Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area.

An SPD is used to provide greater detail and guidance on Local Plan policies within an area. Once adopted, the Old Deer Park SPD will be taken into account when considering future planning applications within the Conservation Area to ensure any developments conserve and enhance the character of the Park.

Representatives from the Council will be available to discuss the proposals at Pools on the Park from 9.30am - 1.30pm on Saturday 6<sup>th</sup> January 2018 and at Richmond Adult Community College from 4pm-8pm on Thursday 11<sup>th</sup> January 2018.

Cllr Pamela Fleming, Cabinet member for Environment, Business and Community said:

> "Developing a specific SPD for Old Deer Park will help ensure any developments remain sensitive to the Park's historic attributes and support the important recreation, sport and community activities which take place in the Park.
>
>  "The SPD will be used in assessing planning and other applications with the Old Deer Park Conservation Area.
>
>  "If you are a user of the park and would like to have input into formation of this Document I encourage you to have your say before the deadline."

This is the formal stage of consultation, with previous consultations having taken place in Summer 2015 and Autumn 2016.
