American football is returning to the borough next month, with two games at Twickenham Stadium - bringing with it a host of traditional NFL entertainment and activities throughout the day.

The first game (Arizona Cardinals v Los Angeles Rams) will take place on Sunday 22 October, with kick off at 6pm. The second game (Minnesota Vikings v Cleveland Browns) is on Sunday 29 October, with kick off at 1.30pm.

Similarly to last year, the events will attract a family-friendly audience and many visitors will not have been to Twickenham before and are likely to arrive earlier than crowds would for a typical rugby match.

To accommodate for the early arrival, a number of changes to the usual 'rugby match day' transport and security arrangements will be in place.

The usual road closures on Whitton Road North and Rugby Road will be extended.

On the 22 October, roads will close from 10am and reopen at around 11pm, or earlier if it is safe to do so. Then on the 29 October, the road closures will be in place from 7am until 9pm.

There will be managed access for residents who live within the closure area.

The matches will also incorporate activities along the Whitton Road outside the Stadium on both match days. Local residents are able to come along and enjoy the fun outside the Stadium grounds.
