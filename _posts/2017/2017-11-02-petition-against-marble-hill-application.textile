* Terrible impact of increased traffic and pollution within surrounding roads and area
* Endangering wildlife and some protected species
* Devastating effect on Grade II listed houses abutting proposed new 140 seat caf√©
* Destroying the treasured peace and tranquillity of Marble Hill House  Gardens
