Eighteen community projects from across the borough are out for public feedback and the Council is asking for public support as to which should receive funding.

Earlier this year Richmond Council invited local communities to submit their ideas for projects which could receive part of &pound;1m Village Planning Fund. The Council received a total of 35 projects and eighteen will be going through to this next stage.

From 2 October 2017 to 27 October 2017 you are invited to "go online and review each proposal and tell us which projects you support.":http://www.richmond.gov.uk/myrichmond/village_plans/village_planning_fund

Hard copies of the questionnaire will be available in the libraries and Community Links Officers will be facilitating a number of drop ins for non-digital users.
