With nearly 80% of the electorate turing out to vote, Vince Cable easily defeated Tania Mathias and Katherine Dunne in this week's election.

h4. Twickenham - results

<table><tr><th>Election Candidate</th><th>Party</th><th>Votes</th><th>%</th></tr><tr><td>Cable, Vince</td><td>Liberal Democrat Party</td><td>34,969</td><td>52.75%</td></tr><tr><td>Mathias, Tania</td><td>Conservative Party</td><td>25,207</td><td>38.03%</td></tr><tr><td>Dunne, Katherine Sarah</td><td>Labour Party</td><td>6,114</td><td>9.22%</td></tr></table>


That's nearly 11,000 more votes for Vince than in 2015!  The Greens tactically didn't run this time and there was no UKIP candidate, but a lot more people turned out.

What do you think?
