Nestled alongside St Margarets railway station in the heart of the bustling high street, Movers and Shapers brings a boutique fitness experience to the local community at affordable prices.

The re-launched timetable of small group exercise classes, carefully curated by new studio manager, Arianna includes old favorites such as Yoga and Indoor Cycling and new innovative classes including HIIT and Functional Training. Even mum and child sessions are now on offer, all delivered by our in-house team of friendly and dynamic trainers.

Movers and Shapers keep your results in mind with our small group sessions, which are delivered to a maximum of 5-15 participants dependent of the class genre, so exercises and intensity can be personalised to each individual, and with classes ranging from 30 - 60 minutes they fit perfectly into busy schedules.

It's not just the timetable that has been revamped. Movers and Shapers recently increased the number of membership options to offer more flexibility for the community with individual sessions, packages and monthly options now available.

So whether you are a fitness fanatic or simply looking to get active, we look forward to welcoming you to Movers and Shapers St Margarets soon.
