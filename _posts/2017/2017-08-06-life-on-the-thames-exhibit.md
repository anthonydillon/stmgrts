A new photography exhibition, celebrating life on the Thames will open next month at the Riverside Gallery in Richmond.

Award winning photographer, Paul Stewart, will open his exhibition at the Gallery from 12 August - 23 September. The exhibition is in partnership with The Thames Landscape Strategy.

The photos include a selection of work from the photographer's forthcoming new book 'River: the Life of the Arcadian Thames'. His work depicts images of the landscape, working life, play and the people who make the river special along this most magical stretch of the Thames.

It looks at the historic houses, palaces, waterworks, breweries, boatyards, historic inns and pubs from Chiswick to Weybridge. It is also a celebration of those who live and work on the river, or around it. Ranging from those who provide river 'taxi' services to those who row, jog or cycle on or alongside the river.

Cllr David Linnette, Richmond Council Cabinet Member for Arts, said:

> "Richmond upon Thames is the only London borough to straddle both sides of the River Thames.
> 
>  "The river acts like an artery, running through the borough. It provides a home to many people, it provides work and it provides a focal point for residents to enjoy.
> 
> 
>  "This exhibition will celebrate the beauty of the river, whilst capturing the key role it plays in the lives of people right across our borough."
>

 Jason Debney, Co-ordinator of the Thames Landscape Strategy, said:

> "It has been wonderful working with Paul as he has recorded life along the river. His work really captures just how wonderful our stretch of the Thames is and all those people who work or use it".
