### YOU'RE OPENNESS TO EXPLORE YOURSELF IS VERY MUCH WELCOME

Meaning an experiential learning facilitator will be giving your insights about how to implement the experience into daily life.

At each session you will be creating your personal piece of art which will be used in order to address spesific topics, such as awareness, resilince, life balance and well being. As much as we embrace these topics in an aware way in today's hustle and bustle, the more we will be armed against challenges and filled with joy and happiness.

The workshops are designed with self awareness practices, group exchanges, experiential learning activities and watercolor art work making.

*Join us today! Don't be late for booking!*
