A volley of changes and improvements are taking place now that the management of the borough's eleven tennis court sites is back with Richmond Council.

Refurbishment of three sites (Cambridge Gardens, York House Gardens and Sheen Common) is currently underway with the courts being cleaned, lines re-painted and new nets installed.  These three sites will also be fitted with a new gate access system, through a partnership scheme with the Lawn Tennis Association.

In addition to these three sites, Palewell Common and King George's Field all have a coaching programme on site and deliver both junior and adult coaching programmes.

The cost to hire a court will be &pound;8 per hour or an annual membership for &pound;50. This membership will allow access to, and use of, any of the borough's eleven public tennis courts sites. Juniors under 16 years of age are entitled to free membership.

Any income received from the use of the courts will go directly back into a refurbishment fund which will ensure that, over the coming years, the borough's tennis courts will be maintained to a high standard.

[ClubSpark](https://clubspark.lta.org.uk/playtennisrichmond), a new online tool, will be used to manage and promote tennis facilities.  For the three tennis court sites with gate access, all payments and bookings for tennis courts will be made through this new system.

In order to book a court, tennis players will need to create an online account with ClubSpark. Once they register, they will be able to book a court and will receive a four digit pin code. This pin code will then need to be entered at the gate to gain access to the court.

The other eight tennis court sites will also be managed by this system but will not have gate access. For these courts, residents will book their court through ClubSpark and they will receive confirmation of the booking with the date, time and court that they have booked.

Ishbel Murray, Assistant Director for Contracts and Leisure, for Richmond Council, said:

> "We're really pleased to be managing the borough's tennis courts once more and very much looking forward to seeing these improvements taking place over the next few months.


> "Tennis is a popular sport in Richmond and the courts are always very busy when the weather starts to get a bit warmer. The Council is always looking at ways to improve the borough's sports offer and we have some of the fittest and healthiest residents in the country - so I'm sure these improvements will be well received."
