*Have the thyme of your life at an exhibition dedicated to botanical art*

An exhibition which celebrates contemporary botanical art and illustration should blossom with success when it opens at the Orleans House Gallery run Riverside Gallery in Richmond on Saturday, 25 February 2017.

'Botanical Beauty' will bring together the work of artists, illustrators, photographers and textile artists from across the country to Richmond. There has been a revival in popularity for botanical art, which saw its heyday span the 17<sup>th</sup> to the 19<sup>th</sup> century. The free exhibition is varied and includes work on exotic flowers, plants, fruits and trees to studies of the simple carrot, onion and spud.

Many of the exhibiting artists, such as Amber Halsall and Josie White, are members of the prestigious Society of Botanical Artists and all selected artworks are notable for their accuracy and stunning detail. Local artists have also had their artwork selected and include: Alexandra Robb, Janice Gazetas, Mail on Sunday photographer Cathy Cooper and Haydon Williams, who is exhibiting a giant mixed media sycamore seed pod.

Richmond Council's Cabinet Member for Arts and Culture, Cllr Meena Bond, said:

> "Richmond is the home of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, as well as a number of beautiful parks and gardens so it is rather apt that the Riverside Gallery is showcasing a celebration of plants and flowers. The artwork on display is by some of the country's most talented botanical artists - so this is a must see exhibition."

The free exhibition opens on Saturday, February 25 and runs until April 1. All artwork will be available for sale with prices ranging from £60 to £3,950.
