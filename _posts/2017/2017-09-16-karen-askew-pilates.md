    Running the classes locally since 2008 and booking new students in East Twickenham and Twickenham.

    In every session my aim is to teach a safe, effective and beneficial set of exercises that work for everyone in the group, modifying exercises to suit, if a person has a shoulder problem I will simplify the move until they are ready to move on. After each class I want you to feel you have worked your whole body but feel relaxed and stretched.

Running the classes locally since 2008 and booking new students in East Twickenham and Twickenham.

In every session my aim is to teach a safe, effective and beneficial set of exercises that work for everyone in the group, modifying exercises to suit, if a person has a shoulder problem I will simplify the move until they are ready to move on. After each class I want you to feel you have worked your whole body but feel relaxed and stretched.

I use the 8 Principles of Pilates which include working for strength, flexibility, co-ordination and I particularly work for good posture. I have received positive feedback regarding the relief of tension in the neck and shoulders, improved stomach tone and a good night's sleep after the class.

The Pilates classes run at 2 centres:

-   ST Mary's Hall, Church St, Twickenham, TW1 3NJ
    Tuesday eve 6.40 and 7.40.
-   ETNA centre 13 Rosslyn Rd, Twickenham TW1 2AR
    Thursday eve 7.30 and 8.30

*Clients need to contact me first to check if Pilates is suitable for them and to book their place.*
