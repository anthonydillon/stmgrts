ETNA Centre have been chosen by 'Starbucks Twickenham' to be part of their CHEER FOR GOOD campaign.

What does this mean for ETNA?

We'll either receive £500 or, with your help, we can increase this to £2,000!

We'll use this money to kickstart our Community Kitchen fundraising campaign. Think of how many cups of tea we can make in the new kitchen! You might even find yourself enjoying a cuppa with us.

What do you need to do?

#### Step 1 - Comment on our neighbourly.com page

1.  Click this link: [www.neighbourly.com/ETNAKitchen](https://www.neighbourly.com/ETNAKitchene)
2.  follow our page on 'neighbourly.com'
3.  make a comment on our neighbourly.com page to help us score extra points! Why not say...

> 'I support ETNA's community kitchen project!'

-   You can even upload an image and they'll award us even more points!

#### Step 2 - CHEER us on Twitter!

1.  Copy and paste the message below into your Twitter feed. Then ask your friends and family to tweet, re-tweet and share. The more mentions that ETNACentre gets, the greater chance we'll have of raising more money.

> Starbucks has nominated @ETNACentre - help us to make a noise to win a grant. Please RT to cheer for us \#CheerForGood \#ETNAcommunitykitchen \#twickenham \#community \#ETNACentre

But don't hang about! We need you to act right now as the campaign closes in just a few weeks' time.

Thank you for your support
