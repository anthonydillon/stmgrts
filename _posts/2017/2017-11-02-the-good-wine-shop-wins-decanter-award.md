The Good Wine Shop has won the prestigious Decanter Magazine Champagne Retailer of the Year 2017 award against stiff competition from national retailer Waitrose and other independent specialists but the judges said "this is a shop worth travelling to, building a name for it's exciting and competitively priced range with an emphasis on grower Champagnes". The shop boasts an extensive list and regular turnover of the best and often small allocation grower champagnes that ensure an interesting and engaging experience for customers.

The success was also founded on establishing Grower Champagne Month in June last year, creating an annual industry wide platform to communicate the virtues of smaller artisan growers making fantastic quality but often little known champagnes. This showcase saw a series of events and tastings in restaurants, wine bars and wine merchants across London & the UK under the umbrella of [www.drinkgrowerchampagne.co.uk](http://www.drinkgrowerchampagne.co.uk)

The Good Wine Shop has further enhanced this reputation for innovation and creativity in communicating its passion for champagne with the recent release of its "BYO Podcast" available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDQBiD69bM) and via audio on ITunes.

Mark Wrigglesworth, the owner, together with Derek Morrison, Retail Manager and passionate Champagne champion attended the annual award ceremony in London last week.

Mark said:

> "I am absolutely delighted we have won this award and been recognized for excellence by the leading consumer wine magazine in the World. This is a real achievement for everyone involved at The Good Wine Shop who have constantly strived to expand and communicate the unique quality of our grower Champagnes and the stories behind them. We also have to thank our loyal customers who have constantly supported us in these efforts, as well as the great new growers we have imported directly and who embody our ethos of Good Wine, from Real People with Great Stories."
