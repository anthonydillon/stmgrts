Develop your creative writing and learn how to generate inspiration from poetry, gallery exhibitions and even the world around us. This term we will be using the following exhibitions to generate ideas and stories:

-   A Collector's Lot: Richmond Borough Art Collection and its Creators
-   Water Water Everywhere: foundation Gallery
-   Art & Soul: Kaleidoscope

Sessions will focus on developing a creative dialogue between the writer and the art work, based on a series of writing exercises and responses to the exhibition.

London poet, Agnieszka Studzinska has an MA in Creative Writing from the UEA, and is currently working towards her PhD at Royal Holloway. Her first debut collection, Snow Calling was shortlisted for the London New Poetry Award 2010. Beginners of all abilities are welcome.
