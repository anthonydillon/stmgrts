An immersive exhibition, at the Stables Gallery, celebrating the history of Orleans House Gallery will open next week.

Orleans House was once was an idyllic retreat, worlds away from the bustling city. It was a pastoral vision set beside a tranquil flowing river, with horses and boats providing the main way in and out.

Now, as the Gallery's &pound;3.6m transformation programme to restore the gallery to its former glory is well underway,  two artists have teamed up to create an art installation - Equine Idyll.

Bethe Bronson and Laura Marker have specifically filmed and photographed material, drawing upon characteristics from local historic documents. They have sought to incorporate elements such as colour, lighting, brush strokes and composition, including key features such as horses, boats and the river.

The material has been edited into low-tech moving-image animations, inspired by 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> century magic lantern shows and parlour amusements.

From 11 May - 4 June their work will be projected directly on to the walls of the Orleans House Gallery stables.

Mayor of Richmond upon Thames, Cllr David Linnette, said:

bq.. "Orleans House Gallery has a unique history. Not just as a modern day art gallery, but a former home of French royalty during the 19<sup>th</sup> century.

"As work continues to restore the Gallery, and make it accessible to even more people, projects such as this encourage an immersive journey through the past.

"It is only open for a short while, so I encourage people to attend."
