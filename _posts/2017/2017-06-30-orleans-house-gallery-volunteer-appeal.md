Orleans House Gallery is looking for an army of volunteers who are passionate for art and heritage to play a vital part in providing assistance to visitors.

The main gallery will reopen this Autumn following a Â£3.6m redevelopment programme. The work aims to restore the gallery to its former glory as well as making it accessible to even more visitors. Works include the refurbishment and extension of the main Gallery building and its immediate setting including:

-   The full restoration of the Grade 1 listed Octagon Room
-   New and improved facilities in the west wing of the Gallery
-   New accessible entrance with lift to upper floors
-   New reception and gift shop
-   An upper floor extension which will provide additional spaces for a new study gallery, enlarged picture store, workshop and training room.

As part of the redevelopment, a new team of volunteers are needed to help in the gallery. This includes Volunteer Guides, Study Room Volunteers, Volunteer Exhibitions Assistants and Volunteer Gallery Assistants.

Responsibilities will vary, ranging from manning the reception desk in the main gallery or the Stables Gallery, giving guided tours of the site, helping with exhibition changeovers, helping to make the Richmond Borough Art Collection accessible to visitors in the brand new purpose built study room, assisting at events; private views; workshops, and supporting curatorial staff.

Richmond Council Cabinet Member for Culture, Cllr Meena Bond, said:

> "Volunteers have historically played a vital role in the running of Orleans House Gallery and this is a wonderful opportunity for anyone who is interested in the arts to enjoy the pleasure of working in beautiful surroundings by the River Thames.
> 
>  "The role is hugely rewarding and volunteers can take great satisfaction in knowing they are contributing to the provision of arts and the enrichment of the life of the local community."
