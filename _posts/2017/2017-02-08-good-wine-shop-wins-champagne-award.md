    Local Kew and Chiswick wine merchant wins the Independent Champagne Retailer of the Year 2017 against stiff competition from other independent specialists but the judges said champagne has "a major in-store presence at both stores" and "a regular turnover of new wines to keep things fresh and interesting for customers".

The Good Wine Shop has been judged to be the top independent champagne retailer in the country at the Drinks Retailing Awards (DRA) from Off Licence News.

It won this prestigious national award against stiff competition from other independent specialists but the judges said champagne has "a major in-store presence at both stores" and "a regular turnover of new wines to keep things fresh and interesting for customers". They added "a Grower Champagne Showcase in June was one of its best supported events of the year as they sought to build engagement and loyalty"

The Good Wine Shop was described by Off Licence News as having "...around 700 wines - plus an impressive selection of craft beers and top-end spirits. The shops are attractive and modern with a passionate and well-informed team on hand to give customers expert advice."

Mark Wrigglesworth, the owner, together with Derek Morrison, Retail Manager and passionate Champagne champion attended the annual award ceremony last night at The Dorchester, Park Lane. Mark said:

> "I am absolutely delighted we have won this award and been recognized by our industry for excellence in this category. This is a real achievement for everyone involved at The Good Wine Shop who have constantly strived to expand and communicate the unique quality of our grower Champagnes and the stories behind them. We also have to thank our loyal customers who have constantly supported us in these efforts, as well as the great new growers we have imported directly this year who embody our ethos of Good Wine, from Real People with Great Stories."
