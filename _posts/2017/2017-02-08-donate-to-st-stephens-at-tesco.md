St Stephen's CE Primary School in Twickenham is one of three shortlisted to bag a massive cash boost from the Tesco Bags of Help initiative.

Tesco has teamed up with Groundwork to launch the monthly funding scheme, which sees grants of £5,000, £2,000 and £1,000 - all raised from the 5p bag levy - being awarded to local outdoor community projects. At the end of the voting period, the organisation with the highest number of votes will get the biggest slice of this cash.

To help our school win this wonderful cash injection, please ask for a token at the Tesco checkout every time you shop in store (one token per transaction whatever the value) and vote for St Stephen's CE Primary School.

Liz Bachour, St Stephen's Headteacher, said:

bq "If we are lucky enough to win your vote, this cash will make such a difference to our outdoor learning area. As an urban school with no outdoor green space, we will use the money to buy some planting systems for our children, upgrade the play facilities for our Reception children and install some den-building equipment for all our children."

Voting ends on 25<sup>th</sup> February 2017. Please vote for us! You will help improve the outdoor learning and play experience for all our children. Stores participating include St Margarets Tesco Express; Twickenham Tesco Express and Teddington Tesco Metro. IT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE BIG TESCO EXTRA NEAR THE STADIUM OR ONLINE SHOPPING.

Thank you for your support.
