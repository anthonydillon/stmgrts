Historian and TV presenter David Starkey will open the book on this year's literature festival Friday night, 3<sup>rd</sup> November at the new Exchange venue in Twickenham.

Starkey, the first of many authors to appear at this year's festival, will be discussing his book 'Henry VIII: the First Brexiteer'.

In this talk he draws on his unique knowledge of Henry's reign to examine his tumultuous personal life, his reign and the political situation of the day - all of which are particularly relevant to today's United Kingdom.

The first week's events also include:

* A look at the history of the green belt and 'suburbia' in a special Richmond event with author John Grindrod
* Travel writer Tom Fort at Hampton Library on Tuesday, discussing the essence of village life over the last 6,000 years.
* Peter Snow and Ann MacMillan, grand-daughter of David Lloyd George, discussing their story of 34 ordinary people caught up in turbulence of war and;
* Interactive story time and family craft workshop with Harriet Muncaster, creator of the popular Isadora Moon books

Cllr David Linnette, Cabinet member for Culture, Sport and the Voluntary Sector said:

bq.. "This is a great way to kick-off this year's literature festival. Events are always popular and I'm told tickets are again in high demand this year.

"This year's offerings are particularly diverse, just in the first week we have authors presenting their work about communities, historical figures and the tragedies of war.

"Mr Starkey's work covers a topic which is particularly relevant these days and undoubtedly people who attend will find it fascinating and enjoyable."
