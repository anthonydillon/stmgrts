A taster of the stellar line-up of acts that promise to make this year's Richmond Music and Drama Festival the best yet can now be viewed online.

The wealth of prodigious musical talents that exist in Richmond has been packed into an explosive programme of events that are taking place across the borough when the three-week festival comes to town starting on 13 March 2017.

Major Highlights include the UK Premiere of Philip Glass' and Robert Moran's opera 'The Juniper Tree', presented by the Helen Astrid Singing Academy, Richmond Orchestra and Thames Philharmonia, a showcase from students at the Rambert School of Ballet and contemporary dance and productions at borough theatres including the Orange Tree, Richmond Theatre and Hampton Hill Playhouse.

The festival just wouldn't be the same without the ever-popular RichDance which makes a welcome return on 3 March and 4 March prior to the main festival opening. The exhilarating two-day celebration of all forms of dance showcases a variety of dance companies and choreographers, professional and emerging dance artists, local schools and youth and community groups from across London.

The festival will launch with a special opening event on Sunday 12 March at 3pm at The Stoop rugby ground, featuring performances from local, national and international artists, including the London Conchord Ensemble.

Richmond Council's Cabinet Member for Arts and Culture, Cllr Meena Bond, said:

> "I am delighted to raise the curtain on the third Richmond upon Thames Music and Drama Festival. The festival continues the tradition of presenting a diverse range of talent which exists within the borough, celebrating the performing arts in all forms. Over three weeks we will be hosting concerts and performances covering a broad spectrum of music, dance and drama from choral workshops, folk and rock and roll to jazz collectives, musical theatre, opera and even a lost Shakespeare play.
> 
>  "We are proud to be able to showcase just some of the exceptional talent that exists within our wonderful borough and will bring you work from local arts organisations, young people, schools and the Barnes Music Festival, as well as performances from professional and international artists especially for this year's festival.
> 
> 
>  "I'd like to encourage as many residents as possible to take full advantage of the wonderful acts and performances being showcased this year and to say a special thanks to our performers, venues, patrons and sponsors for helping make this what I know will be a wonderful event."
