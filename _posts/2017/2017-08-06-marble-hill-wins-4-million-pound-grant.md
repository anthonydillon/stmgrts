A £4.08 million grant has been awarded to English Heritage to restore and open Marble Hill House to the public for free. The 18<sup>th</sup>-century gardens will also be renovated for future generations to enjoy. Facilities in the grounds of the house will also be developed, including the installation of a new play area for children, and a women's changing room at the adjoining sports centre which offers cricket, rugby and football grounds.

The funding announced today has been given to the Marble Hill Revived project by the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) and Big Lottery Fund's Parks for People Programme. Planned improvements to the historic property and surrounding parkland are expected to cost £6 million, turning back decades of underinvestment.
