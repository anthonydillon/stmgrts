The box office is now open for the annual and explosive RichDance event which never fails to entertain and is packed with prodigious talent and choreography.

It's back and bigger than ever with this year's programme filled with young talent, dance companies, movers, shakers and dance tips and tricks from those who know best. Now in its 15<sup>th</sup> year and celebrating dance in all its forms from Tango, Break Dancing and Contemporary Dance, RichDance will take place at the Hammond Theatre, Hampton School on Friday, March 3 and Saturday March 4.

RichDance is part of the borough's Music and Drama Festival which is being showcased throughout March and across the borough. The festival is an annual celebration of the vibrant performing arts culture which thrives throughout the social fabric of the borough.

Richmond Council's Cabinet Member for Arts and Culture, Cllr Meena Bond, said:

> "RichDance is an exhilarating two-day celebration of all forms of dance. This year's programme will showcase an exciting variety of performances from dance companies and choreographers, professional and emerging dance artists, local schools and youth and community groups from across London.
> 
> 
>  "It's the perfect precursor to the Music and Drama Festival and it is the borough's annual platform for new dance. Our aim is to make dance accessible to all by offering performance opportunities to those inspired by it."
