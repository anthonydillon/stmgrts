Living in proximity to a construction site can be disruptive however we fully intend to keep disruption to a minimum. However, should there be any complaints, comments or feedback, residents will have a number of ways of making contact with contractors and Lidl.

The main point of contact during the demolition phase of the programme will be:

Matthews Demolition(Sussex) Ltd  
Stephenson Place,  
Stephenson Way,  
Three Bridges,  
Crawley,  
RH10 1TL

Site Manager: Jason Mead - [07809 278 626](tel:07809278626)

If there are any emergencies at the site outside of working hours, the 24 hour emergency contact during demolition will be:

Dylan Lovelock - [07880 358 578](tel:07880358578)

Management and emergency contacts for the remaining phases of the development will be confirmed upon appointment of the construction contractor. Should you wish to speak to Lidl directly, please contact the following:
