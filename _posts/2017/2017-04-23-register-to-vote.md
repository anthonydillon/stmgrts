*The deadline to register to vote in the General Election is Monday 22 May.*

With another general election coming up soon, don't miss your opportunity to vote in elections - make sure you are registered.

Registering is required by law. You may find it difficult to get credit loans, phone contracts, a mortgage or bank account if you are not on the Electoral Register, as this is used by credit reference agencies.
