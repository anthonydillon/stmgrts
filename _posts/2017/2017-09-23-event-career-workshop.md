Thinking about yourself, now that the kids are back to school?

Are you...

-   Interested in re-entering the workplace after some time out, but are unclear on how to start?

-   Aware that you want to make a bigger contribution to the world, but are uncertain about how to do that?

During the workshop, you will:

-   Identify what's most important to you at work
-   Pinpoint your strengths and unique talents
-   Begin to consider different possibilities for career ideas
