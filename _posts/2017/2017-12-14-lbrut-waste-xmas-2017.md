Residents are being reminded that their collection times will be subject to change over the Christmas and New Year holiday period.

Following the Bank Holiday on Tuesday 26 December, Richmond Council will carry out waste and recycling collections (including Garden Waste Collections) for domestic properties two days later than usual. For example, Monday collections will take place on Wednesday and the Tuesday collections on Thursday.

Collections during the week after New Year will take place a day later than usual. If your collection normally takes place on a Monday, your collection will now be on Tuesday 2 January 2018, and for those on a Tuesday the collection will be made on Wednesday 3 January 2018. Normal collection days will resume a week later on Monday 8 January 2018.

Garden Waste, Box Deliveries and Special Collections will continue through until Friday 22 December 2017 and will recommence on Tuesday 2 January 2018.

Real Christmas Trees will be collected on scheduled recycling collection days between Monday 8 January and Friday 19 January 2018. Alternatively, you can take your Christmas tree to:

-   Household Waste and Recycling Centre, Townmead Road, Kew
-   Barn Elms Sports Centre, SW13 0DG (opposite Barnes Rugby Centre)
-   Squire's Garden Centre car park, Sixth Cross Road, TW2 5PA
-   Old Deer Car Park, TW9 2RA
-   Ham Street Car Park, TW10 7RS

Our waste and recycling teams will be working very hard to ensure Christmas and New Years' collections are completed throughout the borough but please be mindful that due to heavy workloads some collection crews may be undertaking collections later than normal. If you do need to report a missed collection this can be done online [www.richmond.gov.uk/report\_a\_missed\_collection](http://www.richmond.gov.uk/report_a_missed_collection)
