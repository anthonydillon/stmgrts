Turner's House Trust has appointed Lucy Thompson to the new post of House Director of Sandycombe Lodge, the Twickenham villa that JMW Turner designed as a retreat from the pressures of the London art world and hurly-burly of domestic life in his Marylebone house.

Restoration of the building that began in April 2016 is scheduled to be complete this summer, when the building will reopen to welcome the public to a programme of activities, learning opportunities and regular guided tours.

With a Master's degree in museum studies, Lucy is passionate about their changing role in today's society. She has previously held roles in charities and the University of Manchester and most recently at the Manchester Jewish Museum, where she was involved in its restoration and expansion.

Continuing the work of Turner's House Trust she will continue to advocate the huge potential of Turner's House as a tool for learning, engaging and inspiring conversations. <em>"We shall be positioning Sandycombe Lodge amongst its heritage peers in the surrounding areas, as well as encouraging visitors from across the UK and indeed the world,"</em> said Lucy.

> "Sandycombe Lodge is a hugely significant building architecturally and historically, rich in purpose and beauty. I am incredibly honoured to be part of sharing its story with the public."

Catherine Parry-Wingfield, Chair of Turner's House Trust, said <em>"The appointment of House Director is vital to achieving our goal of returning Sandycombe Lodge to its proper place as a unique work by Turner and sustaining its future as part of our nation's heritage. We are delighted that Lucy will be taking this forward."</em>
