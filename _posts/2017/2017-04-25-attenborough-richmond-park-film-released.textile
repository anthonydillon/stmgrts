David Attenborough's new film calls for visitors to help protect Richmond Park's wildlife First TV broadcast on London Live 26<sup>th</sup> April

Richmond Park - National Nature Reserve is a new film presented and narrated by broadcaster Sir David Attenborough and commissioned by conservation charity Friends of Richmond Park.

Sir David explains:

bq.. "Richmond Park is the largest of London's Royal Park but more than that, it's London's own special National Nature Reserve... with thousands of species of flora and fauna. But with 5.5 million visitors each year, the Park is under more and more pressure.

However, as visitors we can all help to protect it through simple actions so that it will remain a very special place for the enjoyment of future generations."

p. Sir David meets some of the rich wildlife in Richmond Park including
protected stag beetles that depend on rotten wood for nesting and breeding.


Richmond Park has been brought to life by renowned natural history film makers who have worked on many of David Attenborough's award-winning TV documentaries including Planet Earth, Frozen Planet and Madagascar.  The beautiful photography, which includes spectacular aerial shots, tells the story of the wildlife and natural environment of London's largest National Nature Reserve and Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI).

Richmond Park's popularity among Londoners and internationally, especially through social media, means that more people than ever now visit it and they are inevitably having a great impact on the Park's fabric and wildlife, damaging grassland and trees, and destroying wildlife habitats. The aim of the film is to help all visitors understand the rich natural life of the Park, how they can behave in ways that are sympathetic to the Park's wildlife and thus minimise their impact on it.

Launched at a special event sponsored by Thames Water at London's Royal Geographical Society today and premiered at 7pm tomorrow evening (26<sup>th</sup> April) on London Live, it is available immediately to view online at "www.richmondparkfilm.org.uk":http://www.richmondparkfilm.org.uk where there is also more information about the film.

Ron Crompton, Chair of The Friends of Richmond Park says:

bq.. "We're delighted that Sir David agreed to present our film, he has lived near Richmond Park for over 60 years and has used it as a place to walk, contemplate and enjoy the natural world. The Park has inspired him and we wanted to make a high quality, visually beautiful film that would similarly inspire visitors to want to protect and conserve it.

Please tread lightly in Richmond Park

We also wanted to share with all Park users and visitors - from local dog walkers and picnickers to international athletes -  our  "Tread Lightly in Richmond Park":/archives/2017/04/tread-lightly-in-richmond-park.html campaign which advises visitors how they can make their visit enjoyable whilst ensuring they help to protect the Park."

p. As Sir David says: Whether your visit to Richmond Park is once in a lifetime or every day, enjoy it and be inspired by its history, beauty and wildlife.  Please love it like I do and remember to tread lightly in Richmond Park.

_Richmond Park - National Nature Reserve_  is available to view as both a long-form 21 min video and a short-form version of 4 minutes; see  "www.richmondparkfilm.org.uk":http://www.richmondparkfilm.org.uk.
