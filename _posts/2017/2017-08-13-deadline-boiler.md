There are just over three weeks left for local home owners who are on benefits, to apply for a London-wide scheme that could see their home energy bills reduced by installing a new, free boiler.

Residents who have inefficient or broken boilers have until 31 August to apply for the Mayor of London's £1m Better Boilers scheme. If successful, the boiler could be replaced or repaired for free.

This pilot scheme will help up to 500 fuel-poor home-owners in London to keep warm this winter by replacing or replacing inefficient or broken boilers with A-rated ultra-low emission appliances, and will reduce annual energy bills by an average of around £150 per household. It also aims to reduce cold-related and winter deaths, improve air quality, save carbon emissions and reduce the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning.

To be eligible applicants must:

· Be a homeowner in London (for owner-occupiers not rentals)
· Be in receipt of qualifying benefits (these will be checked by the GLA)
· Have an inefficient or broken boiler.

Cllr Mark Boyle, Richmond Council Cabinet Member for Public Health and Housing, said:

> "We know that every year there are more than 26,000 excess deaths in winter in the UK.
> 
>  "Some of these might have been avoided if their homes were well heated. However, for many people, cranking up the heating isn't an option due to difficulty in being able to afford their heating bills.
> 
>  "Earlier this year over 700 people applied to Richmond Council for our Winter Fuel Grant - helping them to pay their bills when the weather gets colder.
> 
> 
> "Having a new boiler can also help. By applying for this new scheme, home owners on benefits might be able to get a new boiler for free. This will not only keep homes warm, but will result in lower bills."
