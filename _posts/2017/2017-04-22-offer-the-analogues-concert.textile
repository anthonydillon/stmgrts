A special offer available to readers of the St Margarets newsletter and visitors to the website as we live in an area with such great Beatles links.

The Analogues are an amazing Dutch band who perform the studio albums that the Beatles never performed live. To mark the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club band being released, they are playing the album in its entirety at an exclusive show at the Indigo O2 on Monday, 22 May 2017.

They will also be performing Magical Mystery Tour as a bonus on the night.
They are not a tribute band with dodgy wigs but some of Holland's best musicians playing vintage instruments from the 60's as used by The Beatles when they recorded the albums.

Geoff Emerick who was the Abbey Road studio engineer says of them;

bq. "Listening to the Analogues, I have never heard anything come so close to the original records, they get these records absolutely perfect. If you close your eyes you would really be listening to the original recordings sounding the way they are supposed to sound for the first time".

To hear how good they are have a listen to this clip from the documentary they are currently making.
