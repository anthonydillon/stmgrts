A new local cinema club will be able to purchase new equipment - thanks to funding from Richmond Council.

Following a £1,000 grant from the Council's Civic Pride Fund, Twickenham Cinema Club, a new independent 'member' organisation which aims to show an eclectic mix of cult and classic films from around the world, will be able to buy equipment to help expand their new group.

Having established the club earlier in 2017, the club regularly holds screenings in venues in and around the Twickenham area, initially at the Cabbage Patch and, in the near future, at St Mary's University and Twickenham's new Brewery Wharf site.

This funding award is to go towards the purchase of new equipment including a projector, screen, speakers and a Blu-Ray player.

The Council's Civic Pride Fund is available to individuals or groups who want to organise a project or event to improve their local area and deliver more for their local communities. Grants of up to £5k are available to organisations and £1k for individuals.

Cllr Susan Chappell, Richmond Council Cabinet Member for the Voluntary Sector, said:

> "This new cinema club is gaining new members every week. Whilst Twickenham doesn't have a cinema any more, it is great that thanks to this club people can get together and enjoy films in unique venues in and around Twickenham.
> 
> "This is exactly the type of project that the Council looks to fund through the Civic Pride Fund and I am delighted that we have been able to support it."

Louise Barfield, one of the founding members of Twickenham Cinema Club, said

> "We're all delighted to receive the award. This effectively secures the future for members of our Cinema Club and provides a much-needed boost to Twickenham's cultural scene."
