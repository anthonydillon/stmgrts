Cllr Gareth Elliott, Cabinet member for Digital and Technology said:

bq.. "With Christmas around the corner and more and more of what we do going digital, including accessing Council services, you might be thinking of buying or upgrading your tablet or iPad; but which one?

"Our libraries staff know a thing or two about Android, OS, tablets or laptops. Why don't you drop by and they can offer you helpful advice and also provide a crash course on what services the Council offer digitally too. All part of our ambition to make Richmond a digital borough."
