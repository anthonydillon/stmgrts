Chance for Childhood will be running our Annual Charity Golf Day at the Royal Mid Surrey Golf Club on Friday, 12 May 2017. Now in its eighth year, our Golf Day is one of our key fundraising events, bringing together around 70 players to raise essential funds for our work.

Chance for Childhood is an international charity working in Africa to support children hidden from society, such as street children, children with disabilities, children affected by conflict, former child-soldiers and child-headed households. We work in very harsh environments where violence and poverty rob thousands of young people of their childhood and force them to grow up much too quickly.

The day will include the challenging 18-hole golf course- with sandwiches and refreshments provided- various competitions, followed by a delightful three-course dinner and an auction. The ticket price is £165 per person, £660 to have your own team of four or £45 for dining guests only.
