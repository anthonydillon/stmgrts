Orleans Primary School is seeking a suitable retired/senior local resident to look after our School Allotment.  This will be to keep up the wonderful work our present gardener has already done in the allotment.

We are looking for a local resident with green fingers who would enjoy gardening and working with groups of children to tend and maintain the allotment.
You will need to be DBS checked and references will be required.

We are a warm and welcoming School, please contact the School Office on 0208 892 1654 to arrange a visit and obtain further details.

We look forward to hearing from you.
