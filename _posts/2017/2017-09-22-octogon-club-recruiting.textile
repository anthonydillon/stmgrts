A weekly art club for young people with Special Education Needs (SEN) is now inviting new members to join this Autumn.

Octagon Club is a weekly club for young people with SEN aged 11 years to 17 years. They meet in the Coach House at Orleans House Gallery every Tuesday after school.

Each week the young artists work with professional artists to experiment with exciting materials, visit exhibitions and develop their creative confidence and communication skills.

Previous Octagon Club members have exhibited their work to the public at the Gallery at the end of term.
