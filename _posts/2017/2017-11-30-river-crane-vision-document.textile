Residents across the boroughs of Richmond and Hounslow are encouraged to have their say on a proposed vision to restore 1.8 miles of the lower River Crane.

The Crane Valley Partnership is embarking on the ambitious restoration project between the river's divide with the Duke of Northumberland and Cole Park Island. The project would replace the bare concrete channel, hidden from view, with a more natural river full of plants, fish and wildlife which would run through re-landscaped parks and open spaces. It would see an accessible riverside path installed all the way from Kneller Gardens to Northcote Nature Reserve and give more space in the river channel for water, thereby reducing flood risk.

The proposal follows the production of a vision document by a local steering group, comprised of Richmond Council, Hounslow Council, local Friend's groups, Non-Governmental Organisations and the Environment Agency.

The Crane catchment covers five London boroughs, and improvements to the lower river corridor would be a major environmental achievement for the whole of London. The project would give West London residents four integrated urban and natural landscapes with better cycling and walking routes along the spaces.

These spaces would improve the local network, creating new links between Twickenham, St Margarets and the River Thames at Isleworth.

The Vision is a finalised plan and comments, ideas and concerns of residents will be taken forward to inform further feasibility assessments in 2018, examining the potential for the scheme and likely costs. We will continue to accept views and comments throughout the process and any plans will be shared for consultation before finalisation.

Cllr Pamela Fleming, Richmond Cabinet member for Environment, Business & Community said:

bq.. "This proposal would greatly enhance the usability of the space around the River, with cyclists and walkers enjoying a much enhanced experience. It would also service a significant educational asset for schools, colleges and the wider community.

"I encourage residents who live around, or use the areas near the River to have their say before the deadline."


p. Councillor Samia Chaudhary, Hounslow Council Cabinet Member for Green Policy and Leisure, said:

bq.. "We ask residents to give their views so that this restoration project can reflect exactly what is needed to enhance the area around the River.

"As a Council, we want to see that any plan is something that will provide the opportunity for our residents of all ages to be active and enjoy what the river and its surroundings have to offer."
