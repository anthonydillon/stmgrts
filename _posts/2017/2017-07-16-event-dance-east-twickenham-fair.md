*Memories flow through me like a boat flows down the river*

A specially commissioned dance event celebrating the history of the Belgian Refugees who lived and worked in East Twickenham during the First World War.

Inspired by unique stories of the Belgium refugees who made their home in East Twickenham during the First World War, award-winning choreographer Jennifer Irons has created an evocative new piece of site-specific dance theatre which will bring to life this remarkable chapter of local history and is being performed near the site of the former Pelabon Munitions Works where many of the refugees worked.
