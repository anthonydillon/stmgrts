Calling local Francophiles. I run friendly French conversation classes during school hours for intermediate and advanced adults, who'd like to improve or refresh their French.

There are maximum six students per group. Due to popular demand I have built up from one to five regular groups, who choose to look at current affairs, literature, grammar, or a mixture, all in increasingly confident French! N'oubliez pas la conversation générale en français et l'ambiance conviviale entre amis!

Please contact me ASAP if you'd like more info or to speak to a student. I have just started a 5<sup>th</sup> group, currently with only three members, but the other three spaces could fill up fast.
