Join an after school club... weekly after school clubs on Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursday for 5-15 year olds.

Exciting weekly workshops offer budding young artists the opportunity to explore a broad range of artistic media and practice with our experienced gallery artists. Each term brings a varied selection of projects which are explored in group sizes of no more than sixteen, allowing participants to try more messy and adventurous media than may be possible at school.

Often taking inspiration from Gallery exhibitions or the work of other artists, our Art Club members benefit from being given creative opportunities in a relaxing and inspiring environment.
