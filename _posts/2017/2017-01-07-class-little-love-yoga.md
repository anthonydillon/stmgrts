Yoga is so helpful when we need to slow down and enjoy the precious moments of parenthood - the before the baby is born and for many years afterwards.

Doing yoga with our little ones is so lovely and fun as well bond building in the important formative times. Babies enjoy the gentle stretches, hearing mum's voice and the scientifically developed moves help them reach milestones more comfortably. Toddlers need the repetition, movement and freedom for fun expression at a time when they are branching out to more independence. Yoga is a great way for them to do explore and have fun with mum or dad by their side.
