On Wednesday 3<sup>rd</sup> May, students from local schools Orleans Park in Twickenham, Acton High School in Ealing and Bishop Wand C of E School in Sunbury-on-Thames competed in the final of the annual Young Chef of the Year Competition at Richmond upon Thames College (RuTC).

Eight teams competed in the first round in March which required the students to design a street food menu and serve it to staff and students at the college. The successful teams got through to the final in May who were from local schools Orleans Park, Acton High School and Bishop Wand C of E School.

In the final round, students were given three hours to prepare their fine dining themed dishes alongside RuTC catering students which included a Chicken Pie Millefeuille by the winning team from Orleans Park.

Commenting on the competition, Neal Hook, catering teacher at RuTC, says "it was a great opportunity for budding chefs to show their skills and learn from RuTC's current catering students".

The food was judged on its appearance, taste and creativity by Robin Ghurbhurun, Principal and CEO for RuTC, Barbara Gilgallon, Chair of Governors for RuTC, James Unwin, Curriculum Manager for Hospitality and Catering at RuTC, and Sherwin Mauro, Professional Cookery student at RuTC and Commis Chef at Le Vacherin restaurant in Chiswick.

Looking at the team's work, Sherwin said "opportunities such as this competition will give young people more confidence and teach them how to work effectively as a team".

All students were presented with certificates and the winning team, Ella Bothamley and Marina Palladino from Orleans Park, received a trophy and Â£200 in vouchers to use for catering purposes at their school.
