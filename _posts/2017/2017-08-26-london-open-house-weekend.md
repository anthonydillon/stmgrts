*Architectural extravaganza opens borough's buildings for all*

Over 25 landmarks including mansions, churches, schools, theatres and much more will be open to the public to explore on 16-17 September as part of London's Open House event.

Historic buildings such as the Grove Gardens Chapel, a small, gothic chapel in Richmond; the Langdon Down Centre - a Grade II\* listed theatre and museum; the Egyptian Kilmorey Mausoleum final resting place of Lord Kilmorey and the Royal School of Needlework at Hampton Court Palace, will be open to all in the free weekend long event.

The London-wide programme aims to showcase the most magnificent and inspiring buildings in the borough. Modern buildings with cutting edge design and architecture will also be taking part.

Cllr Pamela Fleming, Richmond Council's Cabinet Member for Environment, Business and Community, said:

> "This is a fantastic exhibition showcasing some of the area's most spectacular buildings, historic sites and architecture. Our borough has some of the best buildings in London, from historic mansions to cutting edge modern spaces, and this is a great way to view what's on offer locally.
> 
>  "Open House is a wonderful opportunity to see very special buildings, some of which are normally behind closed doors, and to find out more about the local area."
> 
 As well as Orleans House Gallery other Council owned buildings are also taking part, including York House, 17<sup>th</sup> century home of Earl of Clarendon and newly revamped Holy Trinity CE Primary School.
