The popular annual craft fair held at Teddington Baptist Church returns on Saturday 18<sup>th</sup> November between 10.30am and 3.30pm featuring regular favourites alongside new stalls to get you in the festive spirit. The Mayor will be attending the event and there will be over 20 stalls where shoppers will be able to enjoy a range of professional designer/makers including jewellery, textiles, Christmas decorations, art, stationery, ceramics, handicrafts and handmade chocolates. Food and drink will be available in the caf√© throughout the day, and a charity cake stall will be on hand to provide sweet treats.

Children are always delighted with the regular guests from Mill Cottage Farm Experience in Hampshire. Their fluffy alpacas and pigs, sheep, turkeys and ducks will be waiting outside to meet visitors, and the alpacas may even take a walk down the high street! This year there is also a free fun animal trail for children to follow as well as face painting and other craft stalls. To add to the entertainment there is a hands-on model railway experience inside for all ages to enjoy whatever the weather.

There will be a variety of live music throughout the day, including music provided by the Ukeaholics, a Surrey ukulele band bringing their upbeat vibe.

The event is run by a team of around 50 volunteers of all ages from the church and attracts a footfall of around 700+ from the surrounding area. This will be a memorable event and entry is FREE.
