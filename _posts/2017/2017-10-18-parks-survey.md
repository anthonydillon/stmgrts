Richmond Council is asking residents to give their views on the Council's parks.

The Richmond Council 'Parks Satisfaction Survey' 2017 will take place over the next four weeks and aims to assess overall satisfaction with local parks and, importantly, highlight any areas for improvement.

Cllr Pamela Fleming, Joint Deputy Leader and Cabinet member for Environment, Business and Community said:

> "We know how much residents value the parks within the Borough and we are always looking at ways we can improve the experience people have in them.
> 
>  "The survey will help the Council understand what residents would like to see in their local park, and help us direct future spending on park improvements to reflect the views and lifestyle choices of local residents, and current and potential park users.
> 
> "If you would like to have your say please do so by completing the survey. It is available to complete online or you can request a paper copy from the Council."
