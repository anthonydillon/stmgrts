Travellers who temporarily pitched up in Old Deer Park in Richmond have moved after being given their marching orders by Richmond Council and the local Police.

On late Tuesday evening 5 September, Richmond Council received reports of travellers bringing 17 caravans and other vehicles, illegally gaining access to the Richmond park.

As per normal practice, the Council started legal proceedings for an eviction order. In the meantime the local Police negotiated an amicable move and travellers left the park on Thursday night.

Unfortunately, following their departure, Council officers found considerable rubbish and debris left on the site. The grass has also been damaged due to motorbike usage. Officers made arrangements for the waste to be removed, the area to be cleaned and the grass to be repaired.

The travellers have now moved to Rosebine Car Park in Twickenham. This is private property belonging to the RFU. The Council has offered support to the RFU to ensure that the unwanted guests move on swiftly.

Cllr Pamela Fleming, Richmond Council Cabinet Member for the Environment, Business and Community, said:

> "Richmond Council does not tolerate anyone who illegally accesses our parks and when people do - we take swift, decisive action.

> "Officers with the support of the Police visited the park on Wednesday 6<sup>th</sup> September to give the travellers verbal notice under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 to leave the site within 24 hours, as they failed to comply with this notice, the Police used their powers under the same legislation to move the travellers on.

> "Unfortunately they have now moved onto private property in Twickenham. We have offered our support to the RFU to ensure that they move on."
