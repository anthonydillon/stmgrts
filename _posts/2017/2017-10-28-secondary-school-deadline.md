The deadline to apply to secondary schools in September 2018 is Tuesday 31 October. This crucial deadline applies for children who were born between 1 Sept 2006 and 31 August 2017.

Parents can find out more about Richmond's ten state-funded secondary schools and information on how to apply by reading the online brochure produced by Achieving for Children on behalf of the Council: 'Starting Year Seven - Admission to Richmond's Secondary Schools'.

Parents and carers who want to make an online application will find a link to the e-admissions webpage.

Parents of children living in the borough must apply online or submit their application form to the School Admissions Team by the October 31 deadline. Those living elsewhere must apply to their home borough by the same date.

People who submit their school choices ahead of this month's deadline will be told the outcome of their applications in March 2018.

Cllr Susan Chappell, Richmond Council Cabinet Member for Children's Services and Schools, said:

> "Transferring from primary to secondary school is an important step in a child's education.
> 
>  "Across the borough, our secondary schools have a commitment to provide high-quality education and attain high standards. This year's GCSE results indeed showed another marker of the continued improvement in our schools.
> 
>  "Our online information provides an introduction to the wide range of learning opportunities, specialist facilities, aspirations and achievements to ensure the future success of our children. It explains the process of applying for secondary schools for September 2018 and also gives information about secondary schools in the borough.
> 
>  "Selecting the right school for your child is both challenging and exciting. Parents are advised to read the brochure we've produced as it contains lots of information about local schools and offers a step-by-step guide to the applications process."
