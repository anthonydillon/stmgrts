*Extraordinary Charity Auction coming to Richmond upon Thames College*

The previously hidden art of the late, well-respected artist, Desmond Jones, will be going 'under the hammer' at a special charity auction on Friday, 9<sup>th</sup> June 2017 in the Sports Hall at Richmond upon Thames College in Twickenham.

Desmond Jones studied at the venue when it was known as Twickenham Art School and the college was presented one of the artist's paintings in February 2016 at a miniature exhibition.

Over 30 charities with a local or personal connection to the artist are set to take part in the auction, and each charity has been invited to choose a painting from which to receive funds raised at auction.

Prior to this year's auction, Desmond Jones' artwork will be exhibited at Orleans House from Friday 12<sup>th</sup> - Sunday 14<sup>th</sup> May. Representatives of the charities and VIPs will also have a chance to see the exhibition at the preview night on Friday 12<sup>th</sup> May.
