Free IT Taster Sessions are being held next week to help Richmond upon Thames residents who want to know more about what's available online.

The Council's Library Services are encouraging people to come along to the IT taster sessions at the Information & Reference Library in Whittaker Avenue, Richmond where friendly, knowledgeable staff can help residents discover how to get the most from the world online.

Whether it's setting up Facebook, Twitter or Skype accounts, learning the basics of eBay shopping or digital photography, or even how to get online TV, radio and eMagazines, our staff will be on hand to help you, and to ensure you stay web safe.

These free sessions are designed to help residents discover a little of the huge range of services available online and offer a gentle introduction for those new to what the internet can provide.

It's just one part of our commitment to being a truly digital borough.

Booking is essential for all except the Tablets Made Easy drop-in session: [www.richmond.gov.uk/events_in_libraries](http://www.richmond.gov.uk/events_in_libraries)
