A workspace operated by Richmond's Library Service which caters for lone workers, small businesses and freelancers, has helped a new business in Richmond take flight.

'The Workspace' is situated on the first floor of Richmond Library Annex and is available to use each day, Monday to Sunday, between 7am and 11pm. The space provides for fast Wi-Fi, printing facilities and lockers, and includes break-out space with free tea and coffee, a small kitchen and a bookable meeting room.

'Recordalife', is the brainchild of Mike Tapia, and will create personal life stories and memoirs in book and CD form. The product is targeted at people who want to capture the life stories, memories and anecdotes of their parents or grandparents, or for people to do it for themselves.

Mike has spent the last few months using the Workspace to develop his concept, as well as using the library's research facilities.

He said:

> "As a single parent I have found the Workspace initiative to be a godsend - it has provided a wonderful and positive atmosphere that helps me focus on growing my business, which was very difficult by working from home and being alone most of the day.
> 
>  "The Workspace facilities and support the Richmond Libraries staff have been excellent - everything one needs to develop and grow a business in a friendly atmosphere"
> 
 Mike has found the collaborative environment within the space to be a great help and will be continuing to work with other entrepreneurs he has met there whilst running his new business.

Kate, who is a freelancer, said:

> "The co-working space is ideal for me as I'm a freelancer and the thought of working from home on my own every day fills me with dread! I'm a sociable person and love that there are other people working around me. Things like the free tea & coffee and printing go a long way too - sounds silly but it really does! I think it's a great initiative and I feel very lucky to be able to have access to this type of space."

Cllr Pamela Fleming, Cabinet member for Environment, Business and Community said:

> "Setting up a new business is immensely challenging, it takes great courage and a lot of hard work. This initiative provides a quiet space with all the facilities one would need in the early stages of business development.
> 
> "The Council is committed to supporting the business community in Richmond and I am delighted the Workspace has been a help to new start-ups as they take their first steps."

Cllr David Linnette, Cabinet member for Culture, Sport and the Voluntary Sector said:

> "Our libraries offer a fantastic range of facilities to people within our community and the popularity of the Workspace shows how greatly the community appreciates these services.
> 
>  "We have some really talented members of the community and the Council is delighted it can support these people to succeed in bringing their ideas to life."
