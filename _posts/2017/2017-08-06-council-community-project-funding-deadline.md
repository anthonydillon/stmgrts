Residents only have two weeks left to submit their proposals for new community projects as part of a new fund in Richmond upon Thames.

The Village Planning Fund comes from the Community Infrastructure Levy, a tax collected by Richmond upon Thames Council and paid by developers. A portion of the total tax collected will fund local priority projects which address the impact development has on an area.

This money might be used for a variety of projects, including; green space improvements, resources and equipment for community use or community centre renovations.

Any local resident, business or community group, living or operating within the borough can bring forward a proposal for the Village Planning Fund. The deadline for applications is the 14 August 2017.

All proposals should be for more than Â£5,000 and must meet certain criteria. Any groups or individuals who have ideas for projects can find out more information online and see if their project is eligible.

Following the application process, viable applications will be subject to a public 'vote' to determine support for the projects.

Cllr Pamela Fleming, Richmond Council Cabinet Member for Environment and Planning, said:

> "We have already had a number of applications for this new fund. But, we know that there are many more groups and organisations who have ideas about how their local area can be improved.
> 
> "Whilst there are strict criteria for the applications - ideas could include improvements to the local environment, including landscaping or open space. It could be new play equipment or improvements to community buildings. We also accept nominations for suggested improvements to our local social infrastructure. For example ideas about improvements to community facilities, a new vehicle to help transport older people to a local service or a mobile art venue..

"Village Planning has given everyone a chance to identify priorities for their area and we have seen how passionate people are about where they live and work. They have a strong vision for the future of their community. This fund will help make some of the community ideas and initiatives a reality.

"Anyone with an idea... submit it now before the 14[sup>th</sup> August 2017".
