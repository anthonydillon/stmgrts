St Margarets is a hive of entrepreneurial activitynad Richmond Upon Thames has one of the highest levels of self-employment anywhere in the country. Richmond Council wants to help that those thinking of starting a business, or those in the early stages of starting up, to access the right support to give the best chance of success.  To do this, the Council and support providers need to know more about the challenges and needs of new or emerging businesses.

You can help to inform future support provision and help other start-ups by contributing your thoughts in a very short survey.
