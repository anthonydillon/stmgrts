    Can you sing like Brenda Lee? Can you "dooby-doo" like the Ronettes? Do you look hot in a 'frou-frou' dress? Are you into the popular music of the late 1950's?
    
    You can? You do? You are?!! Then you might be just the person that a St Margarets based 1950's style rock 'n' roll band is looking for!

You can? You do? You are?!! Then you might be just the person that a St Margarets based 1950's style rock 'n' roll band is looking for!

'Nark Drool and the Shudders', an excellent and experienced semi-pro band, are looking for two female 'chantooses' to provide backing and lead vocals on a repertoire of rock 'n' roll classics, teen ballads and doo-wop 'heart breakers.'

Age and experience are immaterial. All that is needed is a good voice, enthusiasm and the ability to shake a tail feather!
