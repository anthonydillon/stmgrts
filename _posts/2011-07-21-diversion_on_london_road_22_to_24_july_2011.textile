If the recent "Emergency Closure of London Road":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2011/07/emergency_closure_of_london_road_8_to_10_july_2011.html from 8<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> July 2011 wasn't enough fun, there will be a diversion in place from this Friday 22<sup>nd</sup>  to Sunday 24<sup>th</sup> July.

Access will be denied from A316 into London Road, but will be maintained from London Road onto the A316.

The diversion will be via the A316 and Whitton Road back into London Road.
Fulwood Gardens traffic will be banned from turning right and Hill View Road traffic will be banned from turning left into London Road.

The diversion has been requested by Transport for London, who will monitor the traffic on their cameras.

This is essential work to repair a damaged high voltage cable caused by BT work last weekend.
