Here is a note from Councillor Annie Hambidge on the recent "Moormead Parking Meeting":/archives/2006/03/local_parking_i.html

<div class="letter">
Great turnout by Residents to have open discussion with local Councillors Annie Hambidge and Simon Lamb re; Parking Problems in the area.
 
One resident , unfortunately unable to attend, nevertheless submitted a great suggestion which received immediate acceptance;

A further survey to be carried out to define more accurately how much of the problem was residents own making (?) ..only a resident could suggest such a thing!  ie. more than one car per household ; what % of the problem is caused by commuter 12 x5 hours parking and  what is % local businesses ie. Drummond Place  & Post Office are other contributing factors to this problem .

Councillor Hambidge will meet again with Hilary ( Chair of Residents Association ) on Monday after she has verified with Officers how this should be implemented in order that the Council will consider it valid, in that it follows their correct guidelines and procedure.
 
We will report back to you as soon as we have significant news/information .
 
Thank you all for supporting us in our efforts to make life a little easier . 
 
sincerely ............Annie Hambidge
