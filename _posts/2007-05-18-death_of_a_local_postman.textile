bq. "It is with great sadness that I am writing to report the tragic death of James "Mario" Seebrook, who was the son of a close friend of mine. James had been missing for a few weeks before he was found. He was a well liked member of the community, being a local postman, who always had a good word for everyone. He will be sadly missed."
