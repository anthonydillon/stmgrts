Orleans Primary School is a local outstanding primary school located in the heart of St Margarets. This is the first year ever when we have had children aged from 3 until 11 having converted from an infant school.  We currently have a vacancy on the board of governors open to the local community who is not a current parent.

We are interested in hearing from someone who is numerate, with some finance experience but enthusiasm and an interested in getting involved in the community are also important qualities.  If you require further information, please contact Rhian James the Chair of Governors on "governors@orleans.richmond.sch.uk":mailto:governors@orleans.richmond.sch.uk
