This month we're excited to announce St Margarets first community dance, The 'Reel' Village Dance, which will take place in "Winchester Hall on Friday 3 October at 8pm":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/event/party/200705144640.

A fun and relaxed village dance, everyone is welcome, no dancing experience or dance partner is required - just come along and have a go and make new friends in the process!

There will be live folk music from the fantastic local Squirrels Band, featuring the renowned accordionist Paul Hutchinson. The dances will be called by our very own dance master, Stuart Marsden, so there's no need to worry about not knowing the steps - Stuart will talk us through them before each dance!




Tickets are just &pound;10 - a bargain for what we promise will be the most fun you've had for ages! All proceeds will be donated to local charity Spear, working to enable homeless people in our community to find secure accommodation and to take steps towards a more positive future.

To buy tickets or for more information, please call Judy on 07806 612101 or email "Judy.Jackson02@gmail.com":mailto:Judy.Jackson02@gmail.com.
