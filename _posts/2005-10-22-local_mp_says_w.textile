Local MP, Dr. Vincent Cable has <a href="//stmgrts.org.uk/assets/images/2005/Vincent%20Cable%20letter%20to%20RUT.pdf">written a letter</a> to the Richmond Council Planning Control Manager, David Barnes, asking the Committee to reject the proposal for the "wine bar under Streets":/archives/2005/09/application_for.html on St Margarets Road.

From the letter:

bq.. "I have to say that I am entirely persuaded by the [Broadway Avenue] residents' argument against this application.  Their objections seem to me to be valid, well reasoned, and supported by evidence relating to a number of material planning considerations.

No doubt when this application comes to the Committee it will be considered very carefully by Members.  My view is that this is not a development appropriate to this area and I hope it will be rejected."
