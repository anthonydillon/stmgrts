A much loved neutered tortoiseshell moggy called Isis went missing from Gordon Avenue on 20th August, following a house move from the Isleworth area. She had a collar and is microchipped but there has been no news of her since that date, despite leaflets and notices being distributed throughout Gordon/Ailsa Avenues and Northcote/Haliburton Roads. Please check sheds/garages around the allotments bordering the River Crane and elsewhere in neighbouring streets. If you have seen or are feeding her, please contact us to let us know she is safe. Her brother, Goldie, is in decline as we all miss her. Telephone 07866886932 with any news.
