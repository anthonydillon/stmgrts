Residents in Richmond upon Thames can be reassured that the Council is working closely with the Police to monitor the London riots and have rigorous contingency plans in place should any incidents occur in the borough.

Cllr Pamela Fleming, Richmond Council Cabinet Member for Community, Business and Culture, said: 

bq.. "The violence we have seen over the past few days, with innocent people losing their homes and livelihoods is indefensible. There have been no incidents in Richmond upon Thames but we must be vigilant.

"I would like to reiterate what the police have already said: Please can parents make sure that they know where their children are, and ensure they are not out at night. Also, I urge residents not to visit the areas that have had disorder to 'take a look'. Spectators only make the issue more complex for the Police and often get in the way.

"This is a constantly changing picture, and should any incidents take place in Richmond upon Thames, residents can be reassured that together with the Police, we have rigorous contingency plans in place."
