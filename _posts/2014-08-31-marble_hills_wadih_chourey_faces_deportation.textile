_Down's syndrome boy faces being deported from Britain after 17 years - because his parents died_

Wadih Chourey, 44, moved to the UK in 1997 with his mum, dad and two brothers, because he was being mentally and physically abused by local gangs in Beirut

A man with Down's syndrome who has lived in Britain for 17 years faces being deported - because his parents died.

Wadih Chourey, 44, moved from Lebanon with his family in 1997 after suffering abuse by gangs in Beirut.

He now lives with one of his two brothers Camil, 42, in East Twickenham.

MP Vince Cable said the move by the Home Office to have him kicked out was "disgraceful".
