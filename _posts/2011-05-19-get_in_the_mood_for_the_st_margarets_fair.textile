This year we have a beautiful little comedy movie produced and donated by local film-maker Joel Byron ("www.bigplusproductions.com":http://www.bigplusproductions.com). The film was shot on a mixture of retro Super 8mm film and 35mm Lomography photos taken from last year's 2010 Fair, and has managed to perfectly capture the essence of the event with a beautiful vintage feel to it.
