A bid to open an 11-18 secondary free school in the Twickenham area has progressed to the next stage of the assessment process.

The RET Twickenham Trust, which includes local parents and representatives of the Russell Education Trust (RET), will be interviewed by the Department for Education on Tuesday May 15<sup>th</sup>. They will discuss their vision for the New Local School for Twickenham, which, if approved, would welcome its first Year 7 intake in September 2013.

The New Local School for Twickenham steering group is proposing an innovative and inspirational community school, committed to the highest possible standards, delivering a broad and balanced curriculum and valuing the achievements and aspirations of every pupil.


Spokesperson, Beverley Sanders, said "We're delighted to have the opportunity to discuss our proposal in detail with the DfE, and expect to find out in the summer whether we have approval to proceed with our plans.  If we're successful, then we'll be launching our prospectus soon afterwards, ready for the 2013 admissions round."

Ms Sanders continued "Parents who would like to find out more about our plans can visit our website, which has just been re-launched with lots of detail from our proposal".

The steering group will work with the council to identify a suitable location for their school in the Twickenham area and have expressed an interest in the Clifden Road site. However, they are also identifying other site options.
