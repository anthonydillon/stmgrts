bq.. Richmond Council announced last week that the St John's hospital site, in Stafford Road will be used to help expand St Mary's Church of England Primary School.

Costing Â£3.5m, the expansion will include six new classrooms, a large school hall, an ICT suite and specialist facilities for children with special educational needs.

This will enable the school to create another 30 reception class places as it becomes a three form entry school over three sites - Amyand Park Road, Richmond Road and the new Stafford Road site.

Building work is set to begin in September with the new site opening in September 2012.
