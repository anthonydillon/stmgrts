London is preparing to welcome the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, and the *London-Surrey Cycle Classic* road race on Sunday, 14 August 2011 will be one of the most important test events.

The race will take place on _closed_ roads along a 140km route which will pass through southwest London and Surrey, starting and finishing in central London. Roads will be closed along the route and over 60 bus routes will be affected from very early in the morning until mid-afternoon. This includes Richmond, East Twickenham, Twickenham, Teddington, Bushy Park, Hampton, Hampton Wick, Kingston, etc...



While it will be an exciting spectacle, roads and transport, including access to Heathrow and the M25, will be severely affected on the day.  Roads will be closed along the route and over 60 bus routes will be affected from very early in the morning until mid-afternoon.  Tube services in the area will run as normal but they may be busier than usual. If you intend to travel in the area, you are strongly advised to plan ahead.
