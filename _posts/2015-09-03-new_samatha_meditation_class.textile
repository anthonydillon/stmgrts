The Samatha Twickenham class is open to anyone who wishes to attend. No previous experience of meditation is required and beginners are welcome. Please feel free to join the class any week.

There is no charge for teaching, but we welcome donations to cover the cost of the room hire (suggested donation &pound;4 to &pound;5). During the meeting, there is usually a talk and a group meditation practice. Please bring a cushion on which you are comfortable sitting. Because everybody's experience of meditation is different, there is an opportunity each week to speak to the teacher one-to-one, before or after the meeting. Tea and coffee will be available.
