<div class="letter">

There is overwhelming opposition to the tower blocks over Twickenham Railway Station. Less than 20 comments to Richmond Council supported the height of the residential development and over 5500 opposed it. Despite the extent of public opposition, Richmond Council accepted the proposal. 

The Mayor of London (Boris) can overturn the decision. Over 5000 new petitions need to be collected in the next two weeks. The only way that this can be achieved is if you can encourage others to complete the petition (partners, neighbours, family, friends, commuters, residents of Greater London, school parents and rugby fans).
