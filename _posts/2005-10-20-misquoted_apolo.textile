I have failed in my attempt to get an apology or correction regarding the "article I was misquoted":/archives/2005/10/misquoted.html in in the _Richmond & Twickenham Times_.  The writer for the piece and the group editor did not seem terribly willing to even discuss the matter.  So after a few emails they have decided to publish a simple correction about my designation of 'local resident' but no mention of the mis-characterisation.

bq. "... there is clearly no point in prolonging this matter and what we are prepared to do at this juncture to settle the matter is carry a note of clarification in this week's paper merely pointing out that you are editor of the St Margaret's website."

p>. -- email from Paul Mortimer, Group Editor, Newsquest

I told them the point was not as much my designation, but making it appear that I supported the wine bar.  They haven't responded -- last time I talk to them I think.

Look for the "correction" tomorrow.
