IMG and English Heritage have given the _St Margarets Community Website_ details for local resident priority booking for the Marble Hill Picnic Concerts this August.  Unfortunately, I failed to get it up earlier in the week, so you only have from now until Sunday, 25<sup>th</sup> March to book ahead of the general public ticket sales -- sorry!

To book tickets through the priority booking period please go to "www.seetickets.com/picnicconcerts/presale":http://www.seetickets.com/picnicconcerts/presale,  or call 0870 890 0146 quoting reference PB1.
