Alistair Wright of "Crossbats Cricket Club":/directory/sports/200602240454 would like to start a children's cricket club to either meet after football on Saturdays or Sundays if enough people are interested.

The type of cricket they are interested in playing is a version called "Kwick Cricket":http://www.ecb.co.uk/kids/kwik-cricket/kwik-cricket-information-pack,282,BP.html whose emphasis is always on participation and enjoyment.  In practice any number of children can play, from 2 to 32.

If you are interested, please email Alistair at "captain@crossbats.co.uk":mailto:captain@crossbats.co.uk
