In our new tradition of reviewing shows that are nearly ending, we thought we should mention the excellent "Orchid Festival":http://www.rbgkew.org.uk/orchids/index.htm which ends this Sunday, 5<sup>th</sup> March 2006.  Most of the display of 250,000 flowers is housed in the _Princess of Wales Conservatory_, so no marching all over the grounds.

This year the theme is "Orchids in Art and Design" with many displays in the form of paint spilling from tubes, as paint on brushes or on a pallet.  There are also some educational boards explaining how orchids have inspired everything from Art Nouveau to wallpaper to Korean art.  However the stars of the show are the flowers themselves.  Why not head over this weekend and be awed?

Don't forget to bring the kids!
