Wednesday, 19 July at 8pm in Winchester Hall at the Turk's Head there is going to be a [Police Liaison Group Meeting](https://stmargarets.london/event/Meeting/200607050244).

> "This is an opportunity for residents to speak to police and councillors about local issues and voice their opinions on ward priorities. If you do not attend then you will miss out on having your say as to how your ward should be policed."
