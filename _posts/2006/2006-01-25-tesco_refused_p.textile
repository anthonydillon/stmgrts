The _Richmond Council_ refused Tesco's "second request for its advertising signage":/archives/2005/12/tesco_again_see.html.  The council felt that second application provided no material changes to the already refused first proposal, they only attempted to prove that other St Margarets shops were using similar materials.  So the Council refused this planning request on same grounds as the first.    The Decision Notice states,


bq. "The signage, by reason of its design, length and materials, is inappropriate to the age and character of the existing shopfront and determental to the appearance and character of this Building of Townscape Merit and the Convervation Area in general."

Apparently, since the Tesco planning request was retrospective, they will have to replace the current signs.
