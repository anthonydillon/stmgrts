The following story was submitted by Toby Hartwell following his very successful "charity event":/archives/2006/02/a_starstudded_n.html that raised nearly  &pound;2000 for the "Shooting Star Children's Hospice":/cgi-bin/directory.cgi?key=200602091019&action=getlisting.

Friday 10<sup>th</sup> March saw a great night of music at the Turks Head. The event, held for the *Shooting Star Children's Hospice*, packed the Winchester Hall to capacity as 5 bands played nearly 4 hours of music. Headline band, the _Soul Agents_, delivered a storming set to round off a very successful evening that included two new young bands; _Burmese Days_ and _Sixth Sense_, an unexpected reunion fromÂ _the Beatles_ and a lively performance from _The Shooting Ska All Star_s.

The evening, which included an auction of some rare items such as a 1966 World Cup programme and a 1967 Glenlivet whisky, raised nearly &pound;2000 for the charity.

bq. "I was absolutely delighted that so many people were able to come and I would like to thank all the musicians and friends who contributed to such an enjoyable evening. Everyone was extremely generous and I have been asked to hold it again next year, so we'll see!".

Toby asks that if anyone has any photos of the event to mail them to him for the Charity's website at "thartwell@ap.org":mailto:thartwell@ap.org.
