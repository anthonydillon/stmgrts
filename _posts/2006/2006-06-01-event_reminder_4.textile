St Margarets is a special commmunity. We are fortunate with our local schools, shops, friendly streets and local environment. But the pressures of urban living and modern economics could endanger the St Margarets we all value.

Following an idea started during the recent local elections it was agreed we need to devise a local community plan for St Margarets. This Community Plan will address a wide range of issues, for example:

* Transport; cycling and pedestrian facilities; parking and controlled parking zones (CPZs)
* home zones and safe residential streets for our children
* planning and gated developments
* support for local businesses
* the "Tesco problem"
* school places
* environmental protection and improvements -- trees and other street planting
* the River Crane
* Moormead and allotments

The final outcome will feed into the council's Local Development Framework (LDF), and provide our new councillors with guidelines from us, on how we want to be represented.
