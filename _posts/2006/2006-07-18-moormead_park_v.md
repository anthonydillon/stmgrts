Sadly, only a day after the *St Margarets Fair*, which officially opened the new Moormead Park Playground and raised thousands for the ongoing restoration of the park's pavilion, it was nearly destroyed.

> "A gang of rowdy youths were causing a disruption at approximately 11pm on Sunday 16 July in the newly refurbished playground. They were hurling the metal barriers about and clearly intent on causing damage. They proceeded to the skips where they removed refuse to hurl at the pavilion walls. Finally they trashed the new planters with flowers that had only been placed there that morning, less than 12 hours before. The police were called but the youths scattered before they arrived."
