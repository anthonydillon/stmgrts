</div>

There will be a "meeting with representatives of Tesco":https://stmargarets.london/event/Meeting/200612111305 including Area Manager, Corporate Affairs and Store Manager at "Zorans":https://stmargarets.london/directory/restaurant/200506220002 in Crown Road at 5.30 pm on Monday the 18th December for all interested residents and traders to discuss directly concerns around the St Margarets' store. The three ward Councillors will also be there so here is a good chance to air any parking, loading bay, enforcement issues and discuss ways to improve community relations.
