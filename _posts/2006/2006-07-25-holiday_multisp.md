Richmond Council is running a [series of sports camps](http://www.richmond.gov.uk/liveitup) around the borough, a few are being run at Moormead. Children aged between 8 and 14 years can take part. Sports included are tennis, swimming, softball, football, cricket, basketball, trampolining, gymnastics and golf. The emphasis of the camps is on fun but all sports will include some element of coaching, with the exception of swimming which is purely a fun session. All sports are suitable for both boys and girls. All camps run from 10.00am - 3.00pm.

The courses at Moormead are:

Football only

-   Football only -- Mon 24 Jul - Fri 28 Jul
-   Football only -- Mon 7 Aug - Fri 11 Aug
-   Tennis, football and softball -- Mon 21 Aug - Fri 25 Aug

Apparently 2 more children are needed to ensure the football camp runs, so call 020 8831 6107 or e-mail <leisure@richmond.gov.uk> today.
