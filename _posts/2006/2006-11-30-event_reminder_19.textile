Remember the "Fancy a Good Sing":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2006/10/fancy_a_good_si.html article?  Well, despite being short a few tenors -- _hint, hint_ -- the recently formed choir are ready for a "Christmas concert":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/event/Concert/200611300948 at Richmond College.

The concert features choral, chamber music and jazz, performed by the Music Students, Community Choir and Jazz Band of Richmond upon Thames College.  Works to be performed are by Monteverdi, Pachelbel and Mozart.  Also choruses and solos from Handel's Messiah and a Jazz Programme.
