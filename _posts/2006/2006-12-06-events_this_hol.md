#### The Crystal Grotto

**2nd -- 24th December 2006**

Set in the magnificent surroundings of Painshill Park, kiddies can visit one of the most enchanting Christmas grottoes in town. With its frost-covered labyrinth of walking trails, scattered woodland and rolling green glades it looks like a scene from CS Lewis's Narnia.

The genuine crystal grotto is a unique place to visit Santa. The 18th century brick structure is a cavernous hollow of mystery. Your little Santa seekers will tramp along a winding lamp-lit trail to Grotto Island and the magical Wishing Tent, before an elf leads them into the Grotto proper. Here in the twinkling half light they will meet the man himself.

A really festive family occasion, staged in a magical setting, the Crystal Grotto captures the spirit of Christmas. All children booked to visit Father Christmas will receive a present and enjoy a festive activity in the Wishing Tent, if, of course, they have been good.

*Pre-booking is essential.*

#### Polar Express 3D @ BFI London IMAX

*4th November 2006 - 6th January 2007*

A disbelieving young lad has compiled a dossier detailing why he thinks Santa doesn't exist, but as this Doubting Thomas drifts off to sleep on Christmas Eve what should pull up outside his window? A sleigh replete with jingle bells, presents and a plump bearded fellow in red pyjamas? No, in fact, it's a flying steam train! Anyway, the eponymous Polar Express then whisks our male lead off to the North Pole to meet the man himself and learn about the true spirit of Christmas. Fortunately the cheese isn't laid on too thick, so the tale remains heart-warming rather than sickly.

This was the first-ever full length feature shown in the groundbreaking 3-D format. Directed by Robert Zemeckis - whose last dabble in animation created the wonderful 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit', and with a cast headed by Tom Hanks this story book adaptation is a slick production. Filmed using 'motion capture' - the technique that brought Gollum to life in Lord of the Rings - this visual spectacular is perfectly suited to IMAX enhancement.

-   Venue: BFI London IMAX
-   Address: 1 Charlie Chaplin Walk, SE1
-   Phone: 0870 787 2525
-   Date: 4th November 2006 -- 6th January 2007

#### Osterley Park Stable Yard Carols

*3rd, 10th and 17th December 2006*

The yard of the Osterley Park's, still working, Tudor stables will be packed with good cheer for Sunday afternoons as guests gather together for a traditional carol service in the crisp December air. For an additional charge visitors can step inside the house itself to catch a glimpse of how Osterley Park would have prepared for Christmas in days gone by.

Built in the 16th century, the house was completely revamped by Scottish architect Robert Adam during the 18th century. The striking white pillar colonnade that fronts the house is just a taster, paving the way for the ensuing, fabulous, neo-classical state rooms. The house is set in 140 acres of gorgeous, verdant parkland complete with ornamental lakes and pleasure grounds. It's the perfect place to take a winter stroll and blow away all the cobwebs. Keep your eyes peeled for the ghost of a mysterious lady dressed in white, rumoured to haunt the grounds.

-   Address: Osterley Park, Isleworth, Middlesex, TW7
-   Phone: 020 8232 5050

#### Carols at Ham House

*10th, 16th and 17th December 2006*

Resting on the banks of the Thames in outlying Richmond, the Great Hall of this magnificent 17th century building will be the venue of a series of carol concerts.

The afternoon performances will be family-orientated fiestas with a visit from Santa and presents for the young ones, whereas the later concerts will be accompanied by more revelry, with mulled wine and mince pies on offer in the remarkable 17th century Orangery during the interval. Soak up the tones of Musica Divina directed by Simon Desbrulais, plus a number of orations and showcase pieces, as well as the carols to join in with.

#### Trafalgar Square Christmas Tree

*7th December 2006 - 6th January 2007*

For over half a century Trafalgar Square has been adorned with a majestic Christmas tree, an annual gift from the people of Oslo, thanking us for support and friendship during World War II. The tree - perhaps the most famous in the world - is an integral part of Christmas in London. The evergreen is always a prime specimen, a giant decorated only with authentic white lights.

Singing groups and passers-by join around the tree every evening to sing carols and soak up the Christmas cheer (starts 11th December). On some evenings the angelic voices of the St. Martin-in-the-Fields choir lead the tune. This is a wonderful spot to capture the spirit of Christmas.

-   Address: Trafalgar Square, Charing Cross, WC2
-   Date: 7th December 2006 -- 6th January 2007
-   Nearest Station: Charing Cross

#### Southwark Frost Fair

*15th -- 17th December 2006*

The Frost Fair is back for its fourth year, bringing all its usual festive cheer to the South Bank.

The organisers are expecting in excess of 100,000 visitors - so it won't be the place to avoid the crowds. Nevertheless, it'll be packed to the gills with last minute-shopping opportunities and the prospect of whetting that Yuletide appetite a full week in advance (as if you hadn't started already!). The enormous hog roasts are irresistible. Warm yourself up with a piping cup of mulled wine served from behind the gleaming ice bar, one of many frozen sculptures adorning Bankside.

With carol singers, street entertainers and a concoction of musicians this event will no doubt get you in a jolly mood.

-   Address: Bankside, SE1
-   Phone: 020 7357 9168
-   Nearest Station: Mansion House Tube
