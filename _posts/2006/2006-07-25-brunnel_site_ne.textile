Octagon, the developers of the Brunnel Site have submitted a planning proposal to remove the 18th century water feature in front of Gordon House and replacing it with two small ponds, a road and a large paved area.  The paved area appears to be for parking, instead of the previously planned and obviously more expensive underground parking.

Many local resident groups are opposing this application.
