**Do you know of a cubbie hole available to rent at a good price?**

For the last 9 years *The David Adams Leukaemia Appeal Fund* has operated out of a tiny 'shoe-box' office at 120 St Margarets Road for a peppercorn rent. Sadly notice has been given owing to the planned re-development of the building. This has come as a great shock to the staff who have only 2 months to find alternative quarters.

The charity run by Mandie Adams McGuire raises money for The Royal Marsden Hospital. They raise between £100,000 and £140,000 annually, and have raised many hundreds of thousands of pounds over the last thirteen years. They are proud to have funded two research posts during this period, one in the Leukaemia Unit, looking into Autologous Bone Marrow Transplantation, and one in the Children's Cancer Unit, studying the molecular analysis of all cases of childhood leukaemia presenting to the hospital. In addition they have paid for items of equipment and last year, funded the patients' Christmas party on the Leukaemia Unit.
