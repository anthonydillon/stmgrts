A "great night of music":/cgi-bin/events.cgi?key=200602091031&action=getevent is planned for Friday 10<sup>th</sup> March at the Winchester Hall, "Turks' Head":/cgi-bin/directory.cgi?key=200505231518&action=getlisting all in aid of a great local charity, "The Shooting Star Children's Hospice":/cgi-bin/directory.cgi?key=200602091019&action=getlisting.

Toby Hartwell, a local resident for the last 20 years or so, is running this Year's London marathon and aiming to raise &pound;2000 for the charity. He explains,  

bq. "At my good friend Phil Cutts's 50<sup>th</sup> Birthday we both decided to accept the challenge of running the marathon and I was keen to put the hard work involved to a useful end by raising funds for Shooting Star. My children were both at St Stephen's and little Orleans schools and much of the fund-raising at the school during their time there contributed to the building of the children's hospice." 


Shooting Star now needs over &pound;2,000,000 a year just to keep going and they rely purely on donations. Phil is running for the Macmillan Cancer Relief and they can be both regularly seen plodding round Richmond Park.

For March 10<sup>th</sup> Toby called on a number musical friends who live locally and they have all gladly given up their time for this worthy cause.  The evening promises to be a lot of fun. Tickets are &pound;5.00 on the door and their will an auction of some very desirable items including a Fender guitar and amplifier and Virgin balloon flights. The music starts at 8.00. All the money raised goes direct to the charity.

The evening features five talented local bands: 

* _The Soul Agents_ -- who play great Motown and Soul music
* _The Shooting Ska Allstars_ -- known for their irresistible 60's ska music (a close relative of Reggae)
* _Beatles 64_ -- who recreate the heyday of the fab four
* _Burmese Days_ -- a talent young band
* _Sixth Sense_ -- another talented young band
