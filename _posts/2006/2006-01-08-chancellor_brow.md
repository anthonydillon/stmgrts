Instead of only pushing to expand Stansted, it has emerged that the government is planning to launch a new study into "identifying solutions that would allow" a third runway to be built at Heathrow Airport. The information was revealed in Chancellor Gordon Brown's most recent pre-Budget Report and confirmed by aviation minister Karen Buck. Already local action groups like [HACAN](http://www.hacan.org.uk/) and the *Richmond Council* are speaking out against it.
