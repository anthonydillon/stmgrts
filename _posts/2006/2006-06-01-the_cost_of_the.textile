A recent article in the _Evening Standard_ (30 May 2006) stated what residents know only too well... the cost of living in the catchment for our local schools is high; however, we were surprised to read that "Orleans Infants School":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/directory/school/200506280125 has the highest difference, between the price of homes in the catchment and out, in all of Greater London, 47% (&pound;265,000 vs &pound;180,000) for primary schools.  Waldegrave School, in Twickenham had the highest difference for secondary schools at 57%.
