### Remember

You can contact the local police by email on <StMargarets.NorthTwickenham.snt@met.police.uk> or by telephone 020 8721 2912. This number is for a mobile phone but is charged at landline rates. Both these contacts are only for the St Margarets and North Twickenham Team and are only suitable for non-urgent matters; it may be that the message left would not be picked up for two or three days while the team are on rest days. So they are suitable for leaving information or for non-urgent enquiries. In any event you will you will normally get a reply within a day. In an emergency always dial 999 for immediate assistance.
