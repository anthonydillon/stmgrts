The PTAs at St Stephens Junior School and Orleans Infant School have joined forces to produce a cookery book to raise funds for their schools. Comprising 65 recipes from parents, governors and teachers at the schools, <em>Come and Get It</em> is lavishly illustrated with children's drawings and is published on Friday December 1st.

bq. "Both schools had been thinking of compiling a recipe book for some time, but rather than produce two volumes, we thought it would be fun to work together and do a joint fundraiser. Most children from Orleans Infant School go on to St Stephens, so it made sense to work together. We have had a great response from our parents and have already had lots of pre-orders. The finished book is of a very high quality and was designed for us by one of our parents, Susan Hare, who is a graphic designer," said Sherralyn Rainey, co-chair of St Stephens PTA.

The recipes cover everything from starters and main courses, to quick and easy family meals and puddings. "People sent in their favourite recipes, or tried and trusted dishes which have been passed down through their family. We have been overwhelmed by the response to the book and wanted to get it out in time for Christmas, as it makes the ideal festive present. Lots of schools produce cookery books as a fundraising project, but ours is a bit different from the norm as it is of a very high production quality. I think most people expect a school cookery book to be a photocopied brochure, whereas ours is just like a normal cookery book," continues Sherralyn.

If you would like to order a copy of <em>Come and Get It</em> the St Stephens and Orleans Infant Schools cookery book email Sherralyn on "sherralynrainey@aol.com":mailto:sherralynrainey@aol.com  for purchase details. The book retails at &pound;12.
