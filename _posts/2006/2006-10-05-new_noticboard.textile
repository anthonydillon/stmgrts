St Margarets finally has its own noticeboard, located opposite the St Margarets Tavern at the top of Crown Road.  It is for use by all residents to give information about forthcoming, or results of past events. It will also carry details of Police, RFU and Council events of interest but no commercial advertising. 

Cllr Geoff Acton said, "we hope that all residents will find it a valuable addition to the St Margarets' street scene."
 
Councillor Philip Morgan is in charge of content and will keep a set of keys, an additional set will be held at the Post Office.  Philip can be contacted on 020 8892 6044 or via the Council website on "cllr.pmorgan@richmond.gov.uk":mailto:cllr.pmorgan@richmond.gov.uk.
