After 9 weeks of fierce competition, the 1st Richmond Summer League run by Whitton Volleyball Club has named its winners. The games were played in the Old Deer Park and showed some exciting volleyball that attracted a few spectators.

Anthea Hendricks and Neil Kenyon got to the top positions earlier in the competition and maintained them to the end in spite of some very serious claims from other 10 players on the last night of the tournament. But at the end it was Anthea who took home the bottle of champagne as the first winner of the League. Neil got the second place. And just one point brought Hamed Malti ahead of David Gilbert as he scooped the third award.

Vera Kenyon commented that the Richmond Summer volleyball league is an important developmental step for growing local volleyball community. We hope to continue this new venture next summer and have further local support.

If you want to get ready for the League competition next summer, do not delay. You can start practicing on Sundays 6-8pm in Whitton Sports Centre, Percy Road, Whitton (just off A 316). All levels welcome. Juniors and Seniors.
