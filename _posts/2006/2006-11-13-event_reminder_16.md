[The Good Wine Shop](/directory/wine_aNd_spirits/200511281416) in Isleworth is hosting a special pre-Christmas [wine tasting event](/event/Exhibition/200611131514).

A selection of more than 50 quality wines will be on offer for guests to sample during the evening event which takes place at Winchester Hall on Wednesday 22nd November, 6.00pm to 9.00pm.

Owner Mark Wrigglesworth will be on hand to help guests decipher their Rioja from their Riesling and offer expert tips and advice on choosing the best wines for all occasions. Guests will also be able to enjoy a range of carefully selected breads, meats and cheeses to compliment the red, white and sparkling wines. Mark said,

> "We believe wine is all about enjoyment. There can be a certain snobbery surrounding wines but at The Good Wine Shop we aim to break down those barriers, offering the finest vintages from the world's best small producers, which wouldn't normally be found on the high street."

Special pre-Christmas offers will be available at the event. Tickets can be purchased from The Good Wine Shop in advance at a cost of £7.50 per person or £10.00 on the door.
