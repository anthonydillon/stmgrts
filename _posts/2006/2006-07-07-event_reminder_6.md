This year's [St Margarets Fair](/directory/charity/200507051436) will be [held on Saturday, 15<sup>th</sup> July](/event/Fair/200602210457) from 11am to 7:30pm. It is the 28<sup>th</sup> time the Fair has been held and is the centrepiece of the local calendar.

The Fair is a charity event and this year half of the income will go to the four local schools (Orleans Infant, St Stephen's CE Junior, St Marys CE Primary and Orleans Park Schools) in the area and the remaining income will go towards the refurbishment of the [Moormead Pavillion](/directory/group/200510200949), an important community resource in urgent need of repairs.

The [programme of events](/static/fair/smf_06_programme.html) for this year's Fair include six bands, a football tournament, korfball, country dancing, a dog show, a charity auction and will be opened by Samantha Bond (aka Miss Moneypenny).

*Come down for a great day out and help support your local community.*
