The caf{e'} based in the coach house is closing down having given very little notice to its workers.  

Local resident Sara Bellamy informed us that, "the poor girls only got a week's pay and some of them have rent to pay, it's outrageous!"

According to the _English Heritage_ the current owners had been losing money for years and have not renewed their lease.  English Heritage put out a tender for the lease, but have not found a new company to take over the operation.
