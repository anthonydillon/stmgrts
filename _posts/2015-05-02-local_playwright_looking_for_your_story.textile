Local playwright and performance maker Annie Siddons is making a new show exploring connection, conformity and what is hidden beneath the surface in suburbia. To this end she would love to hear from anyone living in St Margarets who feels they don't fit the norms -- whether they are part of a subculture, have a different lifestyle, or feel like an outsider for any reason. Your participation level can be up to you -- you might just want a totally confidential chat, which would be respected, but you might want your story to be made public, which is cool too. Nothing is too outlandish or outrageous. I am not shockable.

The project will be taking place over the next 6 months to a year and has the potential to become longer term.

In the first instance, drop Annie a line on "anniesiddons@blueyonder.co.uk":mailto:anniesiddons@blueyonder.co.uk and use the subject 'SUBURBIA'.
