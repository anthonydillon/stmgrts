Starting on Monday, the 9<sup>th</sup> of January, NCP will be taking over the Richmond Borough's parking services.  Cabinet Member for Traffic, Transport and Parking, Councillor Mark Kreling, said the "Council officers are working hard with NCP to ensure the contract runs as smoothly as possible from day one. And I am sure that the standard of the parking service will improve enormously across the borough."

Also from Monday the _Richmond Parking Shop_ is moving to 232 Upper Richmond Road West, East Sheen, (tel 020 8332 0925) and the _Twickenham Shop_ is moving to 96 Holly Road, Twickenham, (tel 020 8744 2131).  Both shops are open between 9am and 5:30pm Monday to Saturday.
