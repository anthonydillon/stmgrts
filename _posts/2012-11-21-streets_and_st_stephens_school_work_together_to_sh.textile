Local Green Grocer Carlos of Streets and his family are working together this Christmas with the PTA of St Stephen's Primary School.

St Stephen's PTA is encouraging the school's local families, friends and staff to purchase their Christmas trees from Streets this year and in return will each family will receive a &pound;3 token for the PTA.

This is a great initiative to create new and return business for Streets and at the same time the PTA of St Stephen's Primary School will benefit.

_The PTA at St Stephen's are currently raising funds to extend and upgrade the school library._
