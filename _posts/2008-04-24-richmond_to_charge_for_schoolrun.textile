Parents in Richmond could be paying up to &pound;75 to drive to school.

A controversial scheme that charges parents who drive their children to school could be adopted by local authorities across the UK. Richmond Council in Surrey plans to charge parents up to &pound;75 a year for using their car on the school run. The council says it wants to cut CO2 emissions, but the AA and a group representing parents calls it unfair.  The Local Government Association says other councils battling car congestion will watch the scheme "with interest".

From September, Lib Dem-controlled Richmond wants to charge parents up to &pound;75 for a 15-minute parking permit allowing them to park in bays near their child's school.
