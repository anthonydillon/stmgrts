Ches's Cafe is to become Ches's Trattoria Pasta & Pizza as of Monday 3rd December. A new dining area downstairs from Ches's Cafe has been created almost single handedly by owner Tony over the last year. The restaurant features include a genuine traditional wood burning Pizza Oven made in Italy and installed by Romans, with modern decor throughout and a summer conservatory which is sure to be a big hit with Pizza connoisseurs. Opening Hours will be 6-10.30 Monday to Saturday and the premises are currently unlicensed so please bring a bottle or two of Peroni. 

Please support this new and exciting local project which will provide the good folk of St Margarets with another exciting gastronomic experience.
