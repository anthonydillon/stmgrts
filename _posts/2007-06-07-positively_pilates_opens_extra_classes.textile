On 26<sup>th</sup> June,  "Positively Pilates":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/directory/health_aNd_beauty/200701111508 will be starting three new classes in the local area. The pilates classes will run on a regular basis on Tuesday evenings in St Mary's Church Hall on Church Street. As well as the beginners and intermediate classes a more advanced class has now also been introduced.

Sessions will be kept small and places are limited to help you get the most out of the movements. It is &pound;60 for eight classes and if you have holiday during this time you have the option of carrying two weeks over.
