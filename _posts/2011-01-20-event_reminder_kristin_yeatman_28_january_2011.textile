The Turk's Head presents a high energy funk/soul evening with Montreal born, "Kristin Yeatman":http://stmgrts.org.uk/event/show/200705142696 and her 7-piece band, performing an inspired selection of classics plus tracks  from her new CD, "Orleans Road":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2010/12/local_musician_kristin_yeatman_releases_new_album.html.  Just released in the UK, this amazing CD is influenced by  everything from Stevie Wonder,  Joni Mitchell, Mcoy Tyner, to 70's funk, the Rolling Stones and southern blues, but the style is clearly unique. Having cut her teeth in Canada playing keyboards and backing vocals for bands such as Tim Woodcock and Jeff Healey in the 1980's, Kristin has found her voice as a solo artist.
