h4. We have no time to waste!

Twickenham Film studios has gone into administration and word has it that property developers are moving in. Please sign our petition to help stop the developers in their tracks! 

We don't need more executive homes! Twickenham has been at the forefront of the British film industry for 99 years - let's help it make to 100 and beyond. Spread the word... Re-tweet and post on your Facebook. We need to get this out to as many people as possible. Films like The Iron Lady, War Horse, Ghandi, Italian Job, Shirley Valentine, Help, Hard Day's Night, An American Werewolf in London and many many more have been made here. It's a National Treasure!!
