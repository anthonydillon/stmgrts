    <a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/images//RFU_0139_Susan_Roster.jpg" title="See larger version of - Her worship the Mayor and St Margarets ward councillors Ben Khosa and Geoff Acton welcome Susan Roster to the St Margarets at the recent fair in Crown Road."><img src="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/images//RFU_0139_Susan_Roster_thumb.jpg" width="150" height="102" alt="Her worship the Mayor and St Margarets ward councillors Ben Khosa and Geoff Acton welcome Susan Roster to the St Margarets at the recent fair in Crown Road." class="photo right" /></a>
    
    We welcome Susan Roster and her clothing business - The Secret Wardrobe, a designer dress agency  to St Margarets which is now open at 22 Crown Road.
    
    Susan contacted the St Margarets Traders Association via the "Looking for Premises in St Margarets page":http://www.mystmargarets.com/cgi-bin/commercial.cgi on the traders website to register her interest in St Margarets. The St Margarets Traders association were able to put Susan in touch with a local landlord who was looking for a new tenant. The previous shop remained trading at the premises whilst the paperwork was being completed and this has resulted in a seamless changeover of tenant for the landlord.

From a St Margarets point of view we've not had to go through the endless months of having an empty shop whilst a new tenant is found and the paperwork is completed.

The website "www.mystmargarets.com":http://www.mystmargarets.com was funded with support from Richmond Council under the Town Centre's Opportunities Fund.

If you know anybody looking to open a shop here "please see":http://www.mystmargarets.com/cgi-bin/commercial.cgi
