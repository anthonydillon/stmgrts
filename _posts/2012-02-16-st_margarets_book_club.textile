I have recently moved to St Margarets and am looking to set up a book club.

The Club would meet on the third Thursday of each month at 8.00pm at the Turk's Head Pub in St Margarets.

To get the Club off the ground, it would be great if interested parties could contact me at: "maggiesbookclub@gmail.com":mailto:maggiesbookclub@gmail.com
