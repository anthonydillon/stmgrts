Cole Park Allotments will be holding their "annual plant sale on Saturday May 9<sup>th</sup>, between 2.00 pm and 4.00 pm":http://stmgrts.org.uk/event/auction/200705142123 The sale will take place outside the allotment gates in Northcote Avenue, next to the bridge over the River Crane and on the border with St Margarets and Isleworth.

All sorts of vegetable and flower seedlings will be available including tomatoes, peppers, courgettes, lettuces etc... So local people are encouraged to get down to the allotments and pick up a bargain. Plants are being donated by allotment holders and proceeds will go towards the Cole Park Allotment Society.
