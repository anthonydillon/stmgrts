The Museum of Richmond is honoured to announce that Julian, Lord Fellowes of West Stafford, has very kindly agreed to become a Patron of the Museum.

He said, in accepting the invitation, "I admire and support the museum and I would like to be a patron very much."

Lord Fellowes has already been a great friend of the Museum, having given talks in 2009 and 2013 in aid of the Museum's renewal appeal.  He also lent the Museum the portrait of his paternal great, great, great, great aunt, Georgina Gill, daughter of Admiral Sir Thomas Fellowes, for its exhibition "Living and Dying in Nineteenth Century Richmond". The photograph below shows him with the portrait when he opened the exhibition in March 2013.
