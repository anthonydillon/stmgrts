    <p>I set up the Save Twickenham Studios campaign and was the person who met with Vince Cable.  He was indeed very helpful, as were the local council planning team and the local lib dem councillors.  It did take a while to meet him as I think at first his team were unconvinced that there was a real groundswell of support for the campaign, but after we mass leafletted the area with our concerns I think it became a higher priority issue!</p>  <p>I&#39;m not sure I will necessarily vote for him, but Twickenham could certainly do a lot worse!</p>

    <p>I think Vince&#39;s commitment to our area is second to none. He deserves to be re-lected.</p>
