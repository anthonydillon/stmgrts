    <p>Shame the Gloriana is not to be displayed in Orleans gardens, what a treat and honour it would have been, bringing many tourists to the area, I am sure most businesses around that area that rely on a steady flow of customers for a living will be disappointed, but at least it keeps the Nibby&#39;s happy.</p>  <p>Hopefully the area in Orleans Gardens that is bland and looking increasingly tatty and scruffy, with a cafe and toilets almost out of the last century that are an embarrassment to bring visitors to, can at the very least be given a proper makeover with our council money that would have been spent on the Gloriana project.</p>  <p>No doubt just a makeover will also cause many people to take to the pen to make a protest at even the thought of it</p>

    <p>The &pound;1 million that the council had voted for this scheme was to be borrowed. Now it&#39;s not needed, it won&#39;t be borrowed, so it&#39;s not available for other projects. The project also depended on a &pound;1 million grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund [HLF], which it was unlikely to get as the barge house is not &#39;heritage&#39;- and &pound;1 million from private sources. &pound;50,000 has been spent - wasted - on hiring consultants and as much again on officer time within the Council.</p>  <p>The other businesses are the ferry, which was keen and will lose out, as they were looking forward to carrying visitors over from the Ham House car park, the cafes in Marble Hill and Orleans Gallery and two pubs, the White Swan and the Crown. How much new business were they hoping for? It would be interesting to know. The promise to HLF was 50,000 visitors p.a. but evidence was offered to justify this number. Most of them would have used the brand new caf&#233; at the barge house so there would have been nothing extra for its competitors.</p>  <p>If you&#39;re interested in harebrained vanity projects, you can read all about this one at <a href="https://orleansgardensblog.wordpress.com/">orleansgardensblog.wordpress.com</a></p>
