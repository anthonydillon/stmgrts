    <p>Kendal House stood on Twickenham Road, Isleworth [A310] on the banks of the Duke of Northumberland&#39;s River, near Mill Platt. The present day Kendall [sic] Road off St John&#39;s Road may mark the site, in which case St John&#39;s Gardens next to it was perhaps part of its grounds.</p>

    <p>I have just bought a house in Mill Plat Avenue, Isleworth, and discovered from the orignal conveyance document that the sale took place in 1899 from W N White Esq of the Kendal House Estate to the builder Mr Henry Harris. So the Kendal House Estate also covered this area, which adjoins Kendall Road. Interesting that on the deeds the river is referred to as River Crane, but is now known as the Duke of Northumberland River. Fascinating stuff! Thanks Martyn for the article.</p>
