    <p>On more than one occasion, I have nearly been mown down on the southern pedestrian crossing by cars which failed to stop for the lights. I wonder if the Councillor could install red light cameras so that if they are successful next time, I will be reassured in my dying moments that the errant motorist will receive a fine and might thus be dissuaded from bumping off other pedestrians.</p>

    <p>Is the Council monitoring the emissions at this crossing?. Since its introduction there are more cars idling outside St Stephens School. I think that before more investment is made into making this a permanent  alternative to the footbridge, there should be readings taken to determine any increase in pollution.</p>

    <p>James Your experience has been reported to TfL engineers as has other people&#39;s. Cllr cannot do anything other than challenge decisions as I did with funding for countdown and as we did for removing the Bridge. Ben Khosa</p>

    <p>Marilyn This may be TfL territory and I&#39;m due to meet them early July when I will put it to them. I&#39;m working with TfL at the request of the Police/school and residents to make the crossing safer for obvious reasons and certainly not to make this a permanent alternative. Whilst TfL  confirmed to me that they have "no plans to remove this Bridge" some months ago it may be prudent to remember the phrase "use it or loose it" for the longer term.</p>
