    <p>Does anyone really imagine that the (mythical?) winos of St Margarets can&#39;t already get cheaper cider and lager from the local shops than would be available at a coffee shop? Assuming they are even applying for/intending to make off-sales. Pathetic.</p>

    <p>Isn&#39;t the Turks Head slightly closer than the coffee shop ?? Also you can buy booze from Tesco it&#39;s self from 11am why havent these mysterious Winos appeared before now  !!! I for one have NEVER seen anyone urinating in the streets of St Margarets . This objection seems ludicrous .</p>

    <p>Whatever your opinion of Harris + Hoole selling alcohol, they&#39;ve just scrapped their application to sell alcohol.</p>

    <p>It&#39;s like there&#39;s a St.Margarets anti H+H mafia campaign.  But walk past and is H+H empty?  Is Tesco closing down due to the lack of business?</p>  <p>Plenty of off-licence outlets withing 200 yards, 2 pubs and several cafes serving wine already, amazing the area has not gone to pot already!</p>

    <p>What kind of policeman can&#39;t look up their phone number online or with directory enquiries. This whole anti h&amp;h campaign is just ridiculous.</p>

    <p>So H&amp;H have been intimidated into withdrawing their application. Well done the St Margarets moral majority; Western civilisation is saved and it&#39;s once again safe to walk the mean streets of Bridge Road.</p>  <p>Sigh.</p>

    <p>It&#39;s a cafe, why does it need to be able to sell alcohol from 11am?</p>
