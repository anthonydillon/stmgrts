    <p>I took the first 2 pence on the bridge, my father went to school with Micky Snapper and supplied the turn styles. I took the first money while they installed them, I was seven years old and became confused when asked for change as it was an expression I was unfamiliar with. I remember the hotel dance floor was fully sprung and spent some time bouncing up and down on it.</p>

    <p>I was part of the Twickenham Sea Cadet Guard of Honour at the opening of the Bridge and I also did the Scripture Reading which was part of the Ceremony on the Embankment.  I wonder if anyone has any photos?</p>
