    <p>I took the first 2 pence on the bridge, my father went to school with Micky Snapper and supplied the turn styles. I took the first money while they installed them, I was seven years old and became confused when asked for change as it was an expression I was unfamiliar with. I remember the hotel dance floor was fully sprung and spent some time bouncing up and down on it.</p>
