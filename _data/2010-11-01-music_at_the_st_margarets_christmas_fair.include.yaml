    <p>I have a number of brass pupils who live in, and around St Margarets. They would be interested in performing some Christmas carols on the 5<sup>th</sup> of December if that is the kind of thing you are looking for. They are of school age and a good standard, all around grade 5/6  ABRSM. I look forward to hearing from you. David</p>
