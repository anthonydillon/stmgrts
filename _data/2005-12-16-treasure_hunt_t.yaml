    <p>Does the money from the sale of the grotto go to charity or something similar?</p>

    <p>The grotto has been sponsored by Chase Buchanan estate agents. Chase Buchanan have paid for the &#39;shed&#39; and all of the materials used to create the grotto, they have also paid for all of Santas presents. Thanks to this sponsorship Orleans Infant School and St.Stephens Junior School have both benefited as all of the proceeds from the grotto is split between the schools. Funds raised from the sale of the grotto will also be divided between the schools.</p>

    <p>OK... now would be a good time to make an offer to take the shed!  We want to get it off the street before some real damage is done to it... if you have a place for it, please contact Simon ASAP!</p>
