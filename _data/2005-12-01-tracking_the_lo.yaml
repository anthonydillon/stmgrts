    <p>Thankyou for doing this. I am not happy with the enlarged loading bay and the even bigger lorries Tesco seem to be using. It is up to all of us to decide what sort of community we want to live in and to be considerate of our neighbours. We have a three month period in which to demonstrate how we feel if people use the website to report abuses of the loading bay all the relevant people will recieve the complaint and maybe we can get the change we need to benefit the community.</p>

    <p>I have been watching what has been going on since Tesco opened here and am quite frankly disgusted that nothing has been done to close it down.....what are the chances of this happening and why do we need a Superdrug when we have a great independent chemist on Crown Road.</p>  <p>They both add nothing to the local community.</p>

    <p>The link to the observation form is not working. Today Sunday at 9.40 there were two lorries umarked delivering to Tesco (I checked that both were doing so)--one parked in the loading bay, the other delivering bread, etc in the actual bus stop.</p>

    <p>Although I have only lived in the area for a few years I would like to comment. I like many other people, use the Tesco express regularly. I appreciate that the council may not have the ability to even ask for this to be implemented, but I would like to make it public to hear other people&#39;s views.</p>  <p>I would like to suggest that the deliveries are made well out of peak hours, as the large supermarkets restock and accept their deliveries during the night. Why couldn&#39;t this happen at our local supermarket?</p>  <p>Obviously I would hate for night deliveries to cause noise and disturbance to the immediate neighbours from rattling food cages and lorry air brakes hissing, this should however be avoidable. I hope this can help everyone. James</p>
