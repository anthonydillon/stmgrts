    <p>We use Moormead for football on Saturdays and are delighted to see the proposed improvements, all of which seem in tune with it&#39;s present users which I&#39;m grateful for. I hope there will be some money however, for the reinstatement of the net to stop footballs hitting the locals&#39; parked cars. It can&#39;t be fun for them on that score</p>

    <p>The cars (and houses) need protection in the summer too; from cricket balls.I also think there is a lot to commend the plans, but is the ball court and shelter too hidden away? Ben Khosa</p>

    <p>I have a real issue with football being played in the park. The shouting and language used is offensive and really disruptive to me and my family and ruins our rare quiet weekend days. No other games require this constant barrage of noise and vocal agression .. it is quite unacceptable. This game should be played elsewhere, in and area not surrounded by family homes ... ie Marble Hill Park.</p>

    <p>You clearly cannot mean the 4-12 year olds kids on Saturday and Sunday!  That is one of the best things in all of St Margarets, the way the whole community of parents and children comes together.</p>
