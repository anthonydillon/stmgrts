    <p><strong>FYI</strong></p>  <p>If you are not already aware, this website does NOT run the St Margarets Fair.  I know we have similar sounding names, &#39;St Margarets&#39; and all that... while we love what they do and try to help in any way we can... we <em>cannot</em> help you:</p>  <ul> <li>book a stall</li> <li>get you on stage</li> <li>help you advertise in the already printed programme</li> </ul>  <p>We have provided Fair&#39;s contact information in various links from this post, please use these details to contact the appropriate people.</p>  <p>If you send emails to any address that ends with <a href="https://twitter.com/stmgrts" title="twitter for @stmgrts">@stmgrts</a>.org.uk it is wrong and we might not be able to respond or forward the information in a timely manner...</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
