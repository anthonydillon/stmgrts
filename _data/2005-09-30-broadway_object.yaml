    <p>Could I suggest to Mr Phelps that if permission, for this much needed venue is refused on the grounds mentioned in this letter, that he seek a distribution or warehousing company to use the site. This is the intended usage for the premises and so would not require permission from the local authority.<br /> Lorries, vans and cars could come and go as they please and as often as they please. Local disruption would be ten fold that of the wine bar.<br /> I do hope this fact is taken into account by the council.</p>

    <p>Interesting comment by N Grigg. Seems to be saying &#39;better the devil you know..&#39;.  In fact from what I understand Mr Phelps has already tried to rent it out for warehousing, and failed.  The reason being both the legal and physical restraints of the access to the site, and the one-way system.  In days gone by when larger vehicles did use the mews they backed out into the mews opposite and went up Broadway Avenue to rejoin the St Margarets Road from Broadway Avenue. Larger vehicles now find it difficult if not impossible to manoeuvre around the one-way system back to the main road, and they certainly can&#39;t get back via Moormead and Hillview Road.  Many of the concerns expressed in the letter above and on this website relate to the late night usage aspect of the application.  Business use is strictly controlled and if I lived in Broadway Avenue I think I&#39;d prefer a bit more disruption during the day than during the late evening and night.  I don&#39;t agree with everything the residents have written, but well done to them for organising themselves.  And I certainly agree 100% with their final point about our local environment.  Finally, if the poll on this website is an accurate reflection of local feeling, then it&#39;s pretty obvious that St Margarets as a whole doesn&#39;t think that this is a &#39;much needed&#39; venue.</p>

    <p>Yes this is not a cosy little wine bar tucked away under our friendly local greengrocers.  It&#39;s a large establishment serving drinks and providing meals.</p>

    <p>At long last I understand St. Margaret&#39;s.  The &#39;village&#39; consists of Broadway Avenue, while the rest of us live in normal St. Margarets.  It&#39;s nice to know that there is an enlightened group of our betters who can keep an eye on things and look after the interests of us unfortunates who don&#39;t know what&#39;s good for us.</p>  <p>I think this is an appalling case of a highly localised group of NIMBYs looking to impose their own wants on the rest of us.  They are quick to talk about &#39;community&#39; and the &#39;village&#39; but only insofar as it suits their purposes.</p>  <p>I had been curious about the online poll as the level did not accord with the overall views I have come across in St Margarets in general.  I now think that a concerted anti campaign by &#39;the few&#39; may explain.  I am sure the poll is easily open to abuse and if the residents of Broadway Village persuaded friends, relatives and colleagues to vote (regardless of where they live) then the result is obvious.</p>  <p>Broadway&#39;s letter prompted me to look at this application more closely and I have been reading through the old and new documents on the planning site.  What strikes me is that last year there was an understandable reason for Broadway to be particularly concerned by this wine bar as the entrance was sited in the mews leading off the top end of Broadway and you could sympathise with their worries at the time.</p>  <p>I was very interested to read the Broadway residents letter regarding last years application.  Considering the tone of this current letter I expected to see something even more apoplectic considering the then proposed entrance was off Broadway.  I was extremely surprised to see a number of Broadway residents listed as &#39;no objection to date&#39;.  Why were they happy with the entrance off Broadway, but suddenly incensed when the entrance was moved round the corner and up the St Margaret&#39; Road?  Also, why does the letter say &#39;We would stress that our concerns are not the nature of the business but its operation within the boundaries of a service road bordering our homes&#39;?  Surely this very concern has been addressed, so why even greater objection.</p>  <p>This is what makes me believe that there are a few dedicated campaigners against this proposal and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if a number of Broadway residents are less against this than is implied and probably just added their names for some peace and quiet and to avoid harassment.  I am really angry that a few people appear set on determining what is good for the St Margarets that I live in, just to suit their own agenda. This is what has prompted me to waste half my weekend looking at the planning site and write this overly long missive.</p>  <p>This is a new application with an entrance in St Margarets Road, not Broadway Avenue (and at the farthest end from Broadway).  The issue that now directly affects Broadway is the daytime use of the mews, but this would be a factor regardless as the premises are commercial and is not a consequence of the wine bar.</p>  <p>Children on &#39;bikes and scooters&#39; appears part of a scheme to stir up emotions and fears, like the Gymboree &#39;play area would be the immediate neighbour to the proposed bar&#39;!  Oh please, there is Tesco and Fitzgibbon between the respective entrances.  Is Broadway suggesting that someone is going to tunnel through the adjacent wall?</p>  <p>The Broadway letter suggests that the wine bar is far bigger than previously proposed.  Comparing the plans it is obvious that the increased size relates to the new space required to create the new entrance and consists of a lobby and staircase.</p>  <p>The Broadway letter worries about &#39;people spilling out into an area already overcrowded at certain times of the day&#39;.  What do you mean?  The area is relatively busy when a train arrives and passengers disperse.  This sounds more like a transparent attempt to hijack the very real chaos caused by the Tesco deliveries and link it to the bar.  Surely the busiest activity at the bar entrance would be in the evening as people return from work, long after Tesco deliveries and well after the toddlers and young children are home from school.</p>  <p>One area Broadway reasonably have questions is the potential noise from the rear as well as any air-conditioning or extraction.  Presumably the Broadway residents have questioned the applicants on this.  Was the answer unsatisfactory or did you not get an answer?  There are also issues with traffic and parking in the area, but let&#39;s not muddy the waters with difficulties arising through the Tesco deliveries but look at this objectively.  I realise that the interview with the applicants was published here after your letter was written.  Have any of your questions or concerns been answered?</p>  <p>By the way, I think you forgot to copy your letter to the European Commission of Human Rights, Tony Blair and Prince Charles, you did everyone else.</p>

    <p>Having read the comments, interviews and the information on the planning website, I support the scheme.</p>  <p>The visual impact of the new wine bar is negligible, which unfortunately can&#39;t be said of Superdrug&#39;s new paintwork.  I also agree with other commentators that St. Margarets needs a more sophisticated venue for more mature drinkers.  If, arguably, we have too many loud &#39;boozers&#39; in the neighbourhood already then that&#39;s not a reason not to have a different kind of establishment to cater for a different market.</p>  <p>With regard to the noise argument however, according to the plans the areas of the bar directly adjacent to the mews, and therefore within earshot of local houses, are the toilets, a specialised wine tasting area and the kitchen.  Unless the kitchen has a window and they play the radio loud or bang the pots and pans a lot, I really can&#39;t imagine much noise pollution spilling into the mews area.</p>  <p>I agree with Sally that Broadway Ave. seems to have taken on the role of Alpha Street of the area (must be because they have a CPZ!), and that there&#39;s a hard core of objecters.  I&#39;m not convinced by the argument that they can use the argument that&#39;s its a family &amp; child dominated area.  The 2 bed flats in the neighbouring Kenley, Sidney and Godstone Roads for example are predominantly occupied by professional couples who (speaking as part of that group) would certainly welcome a glass of wine in an evening without being surrounded by rowdy students.</p>  <p>In fact the official demographic classification (according to <a href="http://www.upmystreet.co.uk">www.upmystreet.co.uk</a>) of my postcode at least is ACORN type 15 which actually says &#39;very few children&#39; and &#39;[residents] enjoy good food and wine&#39;.  That&#39;s the real St. Margarets these days.  I suspect the core objecters in Broadway may not be from the demographic that would frequent a wine bar wherever it was.</p>  <p>I wish Grapespot the best of luck in their application.</p>

    <p>There are many small businesses in St Margarets run by people who haved worked long and hard to build up a reputation and a clientelle. These include, Brula, Cutters, Scrunch, The Thai Pin, Streets, Zorans. All of these are run by extremely hard working people who I imagine have spent a lot of time and effort growing their businesses and their reputations. I don&#39;t suppose it is easy. Tescos and Superdrug are if you like two monsters in our midsts who we have no choice but to live with.</p>  <p>The wine bar is not a bad idea in itself but it is too big and it is in the wrong place. It doesn&#39;t matter where you put the entrance the wine bar itself is still in Broadway Avenue and Broadway Avenue is a residential street.</p>  <p>If these people had started small, found premises on the main road and built their reputation and the trust of the local people then they may have had some chance of success. As it is they have already caused huge controversy and they haven&#39;t even opened yet.</p>  <p>There is a lot of abuse on this website from supporters of the bar towards the residents who mostly just want a quiet life and to be able to get on with whatever it is they do to make a living.</p>  <p>Of course the residents of Broadway Avenue are the loudest voices of dissent - the wine bar is in their street. Of course I am upset about it - it is my children who will be kept awake at night.</p>

    <p>As a St. Margarets resident for many a year a pleasent glass of wine at the end of the day, in a bar not catering for the "mobile ring-tone generation", sounds great.  I certainly won&#39;t be driving.</p>  <p>The last time I remember such a local fuss in the Rich &amp; Twick was about the awfulness of Sunshine and Raviolli opening on a Sunday. The fears proved unfounded.  I understand the residents concerns, but feel they are probably looming larger in their minds than the reality that will unfold.</p>

    <p>Sally<br /> Regarding your note responding to the Broadway Ave residents letter, surely the point is that the correspondents DID advise everyone that they ARE indeed residents of Broadway Ave, this is clearly stated and therefore is their subjective perspective and point of view.  Why not accept it as that rather than try to make out that they are speaking for everyone in St Margarets?  Sadly, I think you are over-politicising this and jumping to conclusions that simply aren&#39;t there.</p>  <p>Two points on &#39;NIMBYism&#39;.  The directors of Parvinu in a letter to residents and through their website invite feedback which I duly provided.  I asked them how they would feel if this enterprise was to open within 60 yards of where they lived?  I have received no answer...maybe because they are NIMBYs themselves?</p>  <p>Wheeling out the old NIMBY acronym is a kind of snobbish criticism; "look at me I&#39;m open-minded, not a NIMBY myself" kind of approach.  Dare I suggest it&#39;s because you are an &#39;INIMBY&#39; - &#39;It&#39;s Not In My Backyard&#39; - and therefore you have a different perspective to Broadway Ave residents.  I signed up to the letter because I believe in it and endorse it and the proposed wine bar really is very near to my own back yard!</p>

    <p>re traffic congestion outside Tesco&#39;s etc.  70% of the traffic congestion at peak hours is caused by the school run when Crown Road, Amyand Park Road and adjoining roads become clogged by cars.  Occasionally there is a large delivery lorry unloading at Tesco&#39;s which unfortunately adds to the general chaos.  If Tesco could arrange their deliveries outside the rush hour  life could be much easier.  If, through this web site, parents could be encouraged to walk their children to school this would ease the situation.  Reference the wine bar and other recent changes I think a lot of people are against any sort of change.  I have lived in this area since 1957 and witnessed many changes.  Unfortunately this is inevitable whether it is for the better or not.</p>
