    <p>I have heard from a number of different people that the Kobler&#39;s site is to become a cheese shop.</p>

    <p>Looking forward to a butcher&#39;s - and I heard rumour of a cheese shop coming to St Margarets too.  A baker&#39;s would be great- then we would have high street heaven, and this time I&#39;d use it.</p>

    <p>Great news about Frisby&#39;s old shop.  Looking forward to shopping there again along with my neighbours.  We thought the picture tiles had to be kept because of their age.  Now when is a baker cum cake shop taking over Koblers.</p>

    <p>From what I understood no baker is coming to St Margarets instead we are getting a cheese shop.</p>

    <p>The guys planning to open the cheese shop are due to take over the lease on the old &#39;near and far&#39; shop at number 6 Crown Road not the old bakers which I hear is now back on the market.</p>

    <p>What excellent news. And cheese, too, at Near &amp; Far! Lots of rubbish has disappeared from Kobler&#39;s window, I notice, so it looks as if SOMETHING&#39;S happening.</p>

    <p>Yes - it is true! - a specialist cheese shop could be opening soon (subject to the legal boring stuff!) - and seeing as there is no baker at present we will sell bread too - as you can&#39;t eat cheese without bread, can you??!</p>  <p>Looking forward to meeting you all on the opening night....and obviously afterwards....</p>  <p>Now then, although I know what kind of cheese to stock, if anybody has an urge for a particular cheese that you find difficult to obtain, or just want it supplied locally - let me know!

    <p>Great news about both the cheese shop and the butcher&#39;s. I had heard there was going to be yet another estate agents!</p>

    <p>Latest from Armstrongs is they plan to open on 6 August.</p>  <p>Wish they hadn&#39;t removed the old Popes Grove telephone number from the cashier&#39;s booth, though.</p>
