    <p>The platform works should have been completed in mid November. But as usual thay have overrun, just as they did on recent Monday mornings.</p>  <p>Twickenham station neighbours have just been advised that Network Rail intend to work 24hrs/day through Christmas Day and Boxing Day.<br /> What a considerate organisation they are, NOT.</p>  <p>There will also be works in January and March, but otherwise there&#39;s nothing much planned..... apart from 3 years of Twickenham station redevelopment which will also have to be done at weekends, resulting in more Monday overruns.</p>  <p>Don&#39;t say you haven&#39;t been warned!</p>  <p>If you want to stop overdevelopment and such extensive works you&#39;re welcome to contribute towards TRAGs JR fight against Solum&#39;s monster station at <a href="http://www.trag-sos.co.uk">www.trag-sos.co.uk</a></p>
