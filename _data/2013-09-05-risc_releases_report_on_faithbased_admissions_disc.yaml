    <p>No one want to see a child without a school. But if the only place available is in a Catholic school, someone has to pick the short straw. Given that Catholic schools have been built by the Catholic Church, and are further funded by the Catholic community, with a primary purpose of providing Catholic education, it would be odd if a Catholic applicant did not take precedence.</p>
