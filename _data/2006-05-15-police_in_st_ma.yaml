    <p>A lot of people are still not aware of the police meetings. We need to advertise/promote the meetings to the community.<br /> One of the St.Margarets councillors will soon be joining each of the meetings giving people the chance to discuss police/council issues.</p>

    <p>I think that Simon has a valid point, plus we&#39;re not all around on a Wednesday afternoon.  Any chance of Alan making a guest appearance on a Saturday or Sunday morning in Zoran&#39;s?  At that time it&#39;s pretty busy - and he could make himself known to many local families.</p>

    <p>May I suggest we meet the Police in the Winchester Hall one evening thereby allowing those who work to attend.<br /> Given it is a hostelry the attendence should be high!</p>

    <p>Well this going to sound rather strange, but what about doing a community audio podcast? It can be played on different sites and really get the word out about the meetings. I myself have been quite busy trying to learn how to make podcasts and it&#39;s kinda easy.</p>  <p><strong>waits for idea to be shot down</strong></p>

    <p>Hey Alicia<br /> I&#39;ve not much idea what you mean or how to do it but why not give it a go. If what we&#39;re doing isn&#39;t working why not try something new? How do you think a community audio podcast would work and what would people have to do to listen? Can you tell us a bit more for the uninitiated?</p>

    <p>Hey Ann,<br /> Sure no problem. The easiest way I have found it using a program called Skype, which is free if both participants have it. You then download audacity and SoundTrap to record and edit the recordings.</p>  <p>Basically a podcast is a conversation between two or more people. After it is recorded, it is edited then made into an MP3 file which people can download and listen too, it can be distributed through different websites easier than a long drawn out news post.</p>  <p>A St Margarets Podcast could include residents giving opinions on different topics and issues, the Webmaster could be one host along with another person. If participants don&#39;t have skype, the person who does can use skypeout and talk to the participant on the phone. If you all would like, I could do an example of a podcast to give you an idea of what it is and email it to the webmaster. Just let me know, though here is my warning, I&#39;m American so please don&#39;t kill me.</p>  <p>Who would be interested in me doing that?</p>

    <p>I think that either a evening or weekend meeting would be very handy, no wonder he has not been overun with enquiries, as the only people who are available mid afternoon are "Ladies who do Lunch" or the retired members of St Margarets.</p>

    <p>You ask about police. I&#39;ve never seen any. All we get are ridiculous signs which are supposed to deter thieves. The police do nothing about all the vandals who roam all over St Margarets spraying signs, the cricket pavilion and shop fronts with paint.</p>  <p>The only activity we get in the area come from traffic wardens who make special trips to see if anyone has parked on the double yellows which have been placed at Cole Park View to make a difficult parking situation more difficult.</p>

    <p>JR, If you are around on Wednesday, why not raise these points with the local p.c. and a local councillor. Both will be in Zorans Deli on Wednesday 24th 13.00-15.00.</p>

    <p>In response to JR&#39;s comments I would like to reassure residents of St Margarets that police are patrolling the area. St Margarets has a Safer Neighbourhood team who are dedicated to local issues. We have been actively patrolling in the area and we can be contacted on 07879 432330 or 0208 721 2912 during office hours to discuss particular issues that there are within the area.</p>  <p>PS 3 TW MALIK</p>  <p> <a href="mailto:StMargarets.NorthTwickenham.snt@met.police.uk">StMargarets.NorthTwickenham.snt@met.police.uk</a></p>

    <p>Maybe following up on reported crime might be a better use of police time?</p>  <p>Following a recent attempted theft and criminal damage to my scooter, I had a &#39;telephone investigation&#39; (sic) which took 2 days for the police to contact me after I reported the incident. As a result I have no confidence that any effort is being made to solve the crime.</p>  <p>Having said that local interfacing would be good, but has to be at a realistic time for most people (i.e. evenings and weekends).</p>

    <p>Why didn&#39;t the police or Tesco leave a note by the cash points to alert residents about the recent fraud attempts at the cash point. By making people aware of things people can be extra vigilant. Not everyone comes to this website. Plus, I don&#39;t think these have been the only two incidents since it has been put in place.</p>
