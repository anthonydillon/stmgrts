    <p>I still think the explanations underpining this proposal are under developed. There appears to be no granularity on costs, pros and cons of alternative options, or analysis on traffic impacts. The issue regarding child safety pertaining to the school still remains unaddressed.</p>  <p>To my mind the thrust of information provided is all about the "what we are going to do", rather than the equally important "why we are doing this", and "what advantages it will bring" relative to the existing approach. Only when these advantages are defined can the return on investment be understood.</p>  <p>Only at that point can the consultation become meaningful.</p>
