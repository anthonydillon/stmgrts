    <p>It was of course, not Queen V herself but the Home Secretary in Lord Derby&#39;s third administration [1866-68] who reprieved her in her name.</p>

    <p>There are a few interesting points that would suggest to me the innocence of Elizabeth Gough:</p>  <ol> <li>What concept would a boy of 3 years have of adultery? If there was a relationship between his father and Elizabeth and he discovered it, what would his understanding have been of it? Also, what consequences would the discovery bring to the involved parties?</li> <li>Elizabeth was the nursemaid and the children were sleeping in her room. Any such act of killing a child would have lead to her being a major suspect in any case.</li> <li>The injuries of the little boy were reportedly horrific, this should be evidence of hatred (as it was reportedly felt by Constance) and not just a deed to &#39;distract attention&#39; from the suffocation of the child.</li> <li>The most important point being Constance&#39;s confession. It has been often suggested that Constance was not the only person involved in this crime and that she confessed to protect her brother. As it is a fact that she confessed, why should she have done it, if she was innocent? I cannot see any reason why she would want to protect Elizabeth or her father.</li> </ol>  <p>Nevertheless, we will never know what exactly happened that night...</p>
