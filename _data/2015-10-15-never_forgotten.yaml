    <p>I visited the Commonwealth War Graves cemetery at Kranji, Singapore in 1984.   My lasting impression was the number of Singhs and Kaurs and the youth of the Australian 22nd Brigade among the fallen.   However, the meticulous care with which the cemetery was maintained was also striking.  The continuing work of the CWGC is to be applauded.</p>
