    <p>Thanks to everyone in the local and wider community for supporting yesterday&#39;s Fair.  We went from last year&#39;s wet extreme to this year&#39;s hot extreme - so we&#39;re particularly grateful for you all taking the trouble to join us under the heat of the Moormead sun.  Later in the year we&#39;ll let everyone know how much money will be going to our local schools and this year&#39;s supported charities.</p>  <p>The St Margarets Fair Committee</p>
