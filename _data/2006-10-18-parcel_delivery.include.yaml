    <p>So it&#39;s a "Genuine" scam?  Is that some sort of seal of quality?  Is a genuine scam better or worse than a fake scam?</p>

    <p>A "fake" scam would be one which later turns out not to have existed. I had an email alert about one today.</p>  <p>So the rule is - ignore a fake scam from some random email, pay attention to a scam the police say is genuine. Seems quite clear to me...</p>

Fake scams don&#39;t tend to come from random email addresses, they&#39;re generally sent on by well meaning friends and colleagues.  The best thing to do is this.  If you recieve an email about a postal/telephone/email scam, type a few relevantcomments into google and you&#39;ll pretty much get an idea of the validity of the warning without even having to follow any of the links. If it turns out to be a genuine scam (of which I&#39;ve only ever come across 2) then spread the word. If they turn out to be hoaxes, reply to all, politely suggesting that the sender follows the couse indicated above before sending out any future warnings, and also suggesting that they pass the message back &#39;up the line&#39;.</p>  <p>This Scam is an unusual one, in that it was a &#39;real&#39; scam (i recieved various warnings about it last year) that was investigated and shut down. Somehow, the warnings have reappeared (it only takes one person to start it) and it&#39;s status now resides as a &#39;fake&#39; scam.</p>  <p>HTH</p>  <p>Nige, Internet guardian :-)</p>

    <p>Err the above note WAS true, even the website you quote says that the &#39;scam&#39; was effectively closed down.. The charge of &pound;15 is an urban myth and if you look on <a href="http://www.hoax-slayer.com/pds-phone-scam.html">http://www.hoax-slayer.com/pds-phone-scam.html</a> it also advises that this has been closed down..</p>  <p>M</p>

    <p>Perhaps the strangest twist in this is that the Richmond Police where the ones that asked me to post this notice in the first place... seems like might be the most confused of all.</p>
