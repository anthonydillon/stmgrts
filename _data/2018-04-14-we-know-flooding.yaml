    <p>It is because of the history of flooding in the area and the proximity of properties that I am worried about the proposals to remove the concrete reinforced banks. We may experience more severe problems in the future and higher Insurance premiums.</p>

    <p>Jill is correct. The Crane was canalised for a reason. It would be very foolish for the reinforced walls to be removed.</p>

    <p>I think the intention is to slow down the flow of the Crane - to allow it to meander between its banks and to find its natural pace. At the present moment, particularly  at times of high tides and heavy rain, the lower Tidal section of the Crane is an uncontrollable racing torrent more suitable for White Water Rafting than simple drainage. This is because of the speed of the water passing through reinforced concrete banks further up stream.</p>

    <p>The flooding we get now is a harbinger of what is to come ; the only questions are How soon? and How bad? Prospective residents in particular need to consider this and make sure they are adequately insured before they need it. Anyone who pooh poohs this should study the TE2100 Action Plan issued in 2012 (but overlooked by the council when they designed their scheme for their riverside site which is non-compliant and has been rejected by the Environment Agency):</p>  <p>Local issues and choices: There is a risk of fluvial flooding in Twickenham from the tidal Thames. Choices for managing this risk are given in the action plan for Action Zone 1. As for the Richmond policy unit, at present, the Thames Barrier is closed to reduce fluvial flood risk. However, this use will be significantly reduced in order to conserve the barrier for tidal flood risk management.</p>  <p>This means that vulnerable areas, for example undefended islands such as Eel Pie Island, will increasingly have to rely upon floodplain management and localised defence measures in the future.</p>  <p>Measures will also be required for tributary flooding, particularly from the River Crane which has an extensive fluvial floodplain in the fluvial/tidal interaction zone (Action Zone 1  Recommendation 4). This will be affected by lack of space for new defences.</p>  <p>Floodplain management may also be required for groundwater flooding. This has not been considered in detail by TE2100 and further investigation will be needed in the future . .</p>  <p>(TE2100 action plan: action zone 1  west London p. 85 Policy unit  Twickenham. <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/322061/LIT7540_43858f.pdf">assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/322061/LIT7540_43858f.pdf</a>).</p>  <p>In matters of this kind it is good practice to assume that its later than it seems and so trouble is closer than we think.</p>
