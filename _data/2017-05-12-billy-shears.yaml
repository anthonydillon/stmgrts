    <p>Backwards masking and all the other recording tricks were probably done in case they were exposed.All they would have to say is that if it were a true fraud it would have been stupid to expose themselves. Dual misdirection at its finest. Trying to prove or disprove anything from these albums is a waste of time. DNA and fingerprints do nor lie. Fail once spent over a week in a Japanese jail as his fingerprints did not match the true Paul&#39;s prints. Ringo exposed the scam a few years ago but since then has appeared in several interviews with Fail. No mention of the hoax in any of these later interviews. Why? If Ringo had feared the non disclosure agreement he never would have stepped forward at all. Much money would change hands if true family members could inherit what Faul has taken as his own. Not to mention he would be charged with fraud ad well as all the other Beatles and employees, family members and friends as well.as well. If M15 is actually involved in the switch they could stop the criminal charges in Britain but in the US and the rest of the world they could be open to those charges plus many others. Think of the millions of royalties being given to an imposter. The Beatles never played live again nor come to US for awhile.  Did they see no way around Fail playing his bass with the wrong hand? Were they afraid he would be arrested or have an accident that might expose his false fingerprints, blood or DNA. The anger of the public if he were exposed today is another reason they keep the ruse going. Watch later interviews with Fail and other Beatles members. They all seem to be put off or angry when he refers to himself as McCarthy or speaks of the old times when it was the actual Paul. Faul was to only be a substitute for a week or two, they resent his keeping the ruse going on for 50 years. They have had to keep the fraud covered while Faul reaped the benefits of the fraud. Faul is protected by powerful people and money or he would have been exposed years ago.</p>

    <p>If Billy Shears legally but silently changed his name to Paul Mccartney years ago it wouldn&#39;t be considered  fraudulent would it? Legally speaking...</p>

    <p>The original Paul was reconstituted from his cryogenically stored parts (possible co-mingled with Ted Williams) in 2002 and was one of the (CIA funded) terrorists who piloted the second plane on 9/11. Duh.</p>

    <p>Anyone who can&#39;t see (or simply refuses to see) the fact that the "Paul McCartney" of Sgt. Pepper onward is not the same Paul McCartney pre-Winter of 1966.  You should read the expose in Italian Wired Magazine where scientists proved beyond a shadow of a doubt with facial recognition software that there are/were two Beatles who went by the name Paul McCartney.</p>  <p>"Denial ain&#39;t just a river in Egypt." --- Stuart Smalley</p>

    <p>It doesn&#39;t matter if it was fraudulent or not when you have some of the most  powerful people behind the scenes pulling the strings.</p>

    <p>I know for a fact that Paul died. He was reincarnated as a hamster which I owned as a schoolboy. He told me (as a hamster, of course.)</p>

    <p>No matter what the truth is,  it doesn&#39;t really matter if they&#39;re wrong, they&#39;re right, where they belong.  They were, are and will always be the greatest, most talented band that ever was or will be.</p>

    <p>The original Beatle Paul Was most certainly replaced. If you watch the videos of them both playing you will see thatPaul knew the Bass and rarely ever looked at the fretboard in stark contrast to Faul. Of course anyone with two good eyes should be able to tell they&#226;&#128;&#153;re not the same people  Sargent Peppers Is quite a departure musically and full of Luminati influences. Money is power. I believe that had no choice in keeping up the charade, like it or not. Another distorted part of history.</p>
