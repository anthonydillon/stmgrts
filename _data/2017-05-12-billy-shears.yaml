    <p>Backwards masking and all the other recording tricks were probably done in case they were exposed.All they would have to say is that if it were a true fraud it would have been stupid to expose themselves. Dual misdirection at its finest. Trying to prove or disprove anything from these albums is a waste of time. DNA and fingerprints do nor lie. Fail once spent over a week in a Japanese jail as his fingerprints did not match the true Paul&#39;s prints. Ringo exposed the scam a few years ago but since then has appeared in several interviews with Fail. No mention of the hoax in any of these later interviews. Why? If Ringo had feared the non disclosure agreement he never would have stepped forward at all. Much money would change hands if true family members could inherit what Faul has taken as his own. Not to mention he would be charged with fraud ad well as all the other Beatles and employees, family members and friends as well.as well. If M15 is actually involved in the switch they could stop the criminal charges in Britain but in the US and the rest of the world they could be open to those charges plus many others. Think of the millions of royalties being given to an imposter. The Beatles never played live again nor come to US for awhile.  Did they see no way around Fail playing his bass with the wrong hand? Were they afraid he would be arrested or have an accident that might expose his false fingerprints, blood or DNA. The anger of the public if he were exposed today is another reason they keep the ruse going. Watch later interviews with Fail and other Beatles members. They all seem to be put off or angry when he refers to himself as McCarthy or speaks of the old times when it was the actual Paul. Faul was to only be a substitute for a week or two, they resent his keeping the ruse going on for 50 years. They have had to keep the fraud covered while Faul reaped the benefits of the fraud. Faul is protected by powerful people and money or he would have been exposed years ago.</p>

    <p>If Billy Shears legally but silently changed his name to Paul Mccartney years ago it wouldn&#39;t be considered  fraudulent would it? Legally speaking...</p>

    <p>The original Paul was reconstituted from his cryogenically stored parts (possible co-mingled with Ted Williams) in 2002 and was one of the (CIA funded) terrorists who piloted the second plane on 9/11. Duh.</p>

    <p>Anyone who can&#39;t see (or simply refuses to see) the fact that the "Paul McCartney" of Sgt. Pepper onward is not the same Paul McCartney pre-Winter of 1966.  You should read the expose in Italian Wired Magazine where scientists proved beyond a shadow of a doubt with facial recognition software that there are/were two Beatles who went by the name Paul McCartney.</p>  <p>"Denial ain&#39;t just a river in Egypt." --- Stuart Smalley</p>

    <p>It doesn&#39;t matter if it was fraudulent or not when you have some of the most  powerful people behind the scenes pulling the strings.</p>

    <p>I know for a fact that Paul died. He was reincarnated as a hamster which I owned as a schoolboy. He told me (as a hamster, of course.)</p>

    <p>No matter what the truth is,  it doesn&#39;t really matter if they&#39;re wrong, they&#39;re right, where they belong.  They were, are and will always be the greatest, most talented band that ever was or will be.</p>

    <p>The original Beatle Paul Was most certainly replaced. If you watch the videos of them both playing you will see thatPaul knew the Bass and rarely ever looked at the fretboard in stark contrast to Faul. Of course anyone with two good eyes should be able to tell they&#226;&#128;&#153;re not the same people  Sargent Peppers Is quite a departure musically and full of Luminati influences. Money is power. I believe that had no choice in keeping up the charade, like it or not. Another distorted part of history.</p>

    <p>It seems that someone as talented and no doubt popular as Billy Shears, might have been missed by friends and family, but he just said " Fuck em all. I&#39;m a Beatle Now; and to think that to this day his nuts are still in a vice. Maybe the trip to India and Maharishi Mahesh Yogi made him a believer.</p>

    <p>They are two different people fact, the dna proves it.....why do you think Heather Mills is banned from ever telling the truth? he suddenly paid her off when she threatened to reveal the truth. I work in the music industry and have played with Billy many times over the years and he sometimes slips up with his accent. Ok there has been fraud committed but Billy is actually a much more talented writer than Paul ever was. Makes you wonder who Linda thought she was married to.</p>

    <p>Nonsense. No one&#39;s looks stay the same. His voice was forensically studied and like a fingerprint, it proves the voices to be of the same person. Paul is still alive, but very old now. When i was in my twenties and in the military, my heighth changed and my facial features changed. Everybody is different.  Plastic surgery was in it&#39;s infancy stage in 1966. To make William Shears Campbell look like Paul McCartney then was impossible. Look at live concert videos in 1966 and you can see Paul was already changing from his pudgy round face to a more mature slender version. The Beatles were and still are, the greatest Rock n Roll band ever assembled.</p>

    <p>I love this conspiracy. There are so many questions and co-incidences, etc. The truth of the matter is, nobody really gives a damn. Maybe in &#39;66 and a year or three but now, No.</p>  <p>"In case they were exposed...they could be open to those charges..."  they put clues everywhere?</p>

    <p>Anyone that truly believes this is easily led, there is no proof that cannot be explained logically, little hidden messages  on an album isn&#39;t proof someone has died, the Japanese test that said it&#39;s not the same person  well we all know face recognition isn&#39;t reliable even today, his fingerprints not being recognised at the airport, if I play guitar for days on end my phone won&#39;t turn on with fingerprint recognition let alone a bass when you&#39;re fretting with right hand, and for him looking at the fretboard more they are comparing basic rock n roll songs with clips from wings with complex bass lines, and why would John Lennon write a song in 1972 called how do you sleep saying the only thing you done was yesterday referring to his song, which was written in 1965 by Paul, did he write it to annoy someone who is supposed to be dead,</p>

    <p>Whoever took over knew how to write songs with bite in them and not those poppy paulies although he can do those as well.  And was as musically adept as the Original or better.  PMac and Wings, PMac and MJ, PMac on his own has done and continues to make some very tasty music.  Billy and the Rest are the best.</p>

    <p>The main physical proof is the scar on his upper lip from the December 1965 Moped accident. Everything else falls into place. How could they find a musician that looks,sounds just like him &amp; be accepted by the other 3,his family &amp; girlfriend Jane Asher? Also named his 1<sup>st</sup> biological daughter Mary after his departed Mother? That&#39;s something an "imposter" would not do. Also too many stories. Billy Shears ,William Wallace Campbell or Billy Shepherd ?? Also the picture on the White Album that shows him with glasses (passport picture of imposter) would mean Sir Paul/Faul used/uses  contacts most of the time. What about there is not 1 picture of him using glasses occasionally? He was and still is 5&#39;11" hazel eyes. Has not changed. Also as mentioned in other comments,plastic surgery at that time was green. Imagine why we never saw the bruises etc.</p>

    <p>There is no such thing as coincidence. "Suddenly I was half the man I used to be, theres a shadow hanging over me, oh I believe in yesterday" the clues are there. What IF faul was knighted for his lifelong dedication to the lie? What IF the "british invasion" was about more than music?  And last, IF you were any of the other Beatles members would you have possibly nosedived your career by going public with the truth??</p>
