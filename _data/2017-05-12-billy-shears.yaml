    <p>Backwards masking and all the other recording tricks were probably done in case they were exposed.All they would have to say is that if it were a true fraud it would have been stupid to expose themselves. Dual misdirection at its finest. Trying to prove or disprove anything from these albums is a waste of time. DNA and fingerprints do nor lie. Fail once spent over a week in a Japanese jail as his fingerprints did not match the true Paul&#39;s prints. Ringo exposed the scam a few years ago but since then has appeared in several interviews with Fail. No mention of the hoax in any of these later interviews. Why? If Ringo had feared the non disclosure agreement he never would have stepped forward at all. Much money would change hands if true family members could inherit what Faul has taken as his own. Not to mention he would be charged with fraud ad well as all the other Beatles and employees, family members and friends as well.as well. If M15 is actually involved in the switch they could stop the criminal charges in Britain but in the US and the rest of the world they could be open to those charges plus many others. Think of the millions of royalties being given to an imposter. The Beatles never played live again nor come to US for awhile.  Did they see no way around Fail playing his bass with the wrong hand? Were they afraid he would be arrested or have an accident that might expose his false fingerprints, blood or DNA. The anger of the public if he were exposed today is another reason they keep the ruse going. Watch later interviews with Fail and other Beatles members. They all seem to be put off or angry when he refers to himself as McCarthy or speaks of the old times when it was the actual Paul. Faul was to only be a substitute for a week or two, they resent his keeping the ruse going on for 50 years. They have had to keep the fraud covered while Faul reaped the benefits of the fraud. Faul is protected by powerful people and money or he would have been exposed years ago.</p>

    <p>If Billy Shears legally but silently changed his name to Paul Mccartney years ago it wouldn&#39;t be considered  fraudulent would it? Legally speaking...</p>
