    <p>I have been a fan of the late Hans Monderman since I heard of him many years ago.  He embraces a philosophy that is counter-intuitive to the obsessed health and safety bridgade, where the onus of responsibility lies with the individual and not on the system.  It works well and in many cases has reduced accident figures by 40%. I believe a similar  version is to be introduced to Twickenham and I suggest people put their prejudice behind them to see how it works.  Googling Hans Monderman will bring up many examples of his work.</p>

    <p>The Council Cabinet meeting on November 15 agreed to a 20 mph limit for Twickenham town centre and to proceed to detailed design on the proposed changes:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.richmond.gov.uk/calendar_of_meetings?mgl=ieDecisionDetails.aspx&amp;AIId=24840">www.richmond.gov.uk/calendar_of_meetings?mgl=ieDecisionDetails.aspx&amp;AIId=24840</a> and <a href="http://cabnet.richmond.gov.uk/documents/s36130/Twickenham%20Town%20Centre%20Street%20Scene%20and%20Highways%20Proposals.pdf">cabnet.richmond.gov.uk/documents/s36130/Twickenham%20Town%20Centre%20Street%20Scene%20and%20Highways%20Proposals.pdf</a>  . The cost willbe &pound;6 - &pound;7 m; a STEP ONE bid to TfL has been prepared for up to &pound;4m over three years supported by LIP funding &pound;1m and Council Uplift funding of &pound;2m together with section 106 contributions: I suppose that if the bid is unsuccessful the scheme will be mothballed or abandoned.</p>
