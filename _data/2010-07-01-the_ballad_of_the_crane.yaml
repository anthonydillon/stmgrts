    <p>Many thanks to Martyn Day for a terrific piece on our "Thames in miniature" and for Chris Squire providing FORCE with a welcome plug!</p>  <p>We are very happy to see the profile of the Crane raised, and it is interesting to see that others have worked on this in the past.  FORCE is a part of the Crane Valley Partnership, working for improvements to the Crane valley from its source in Harrow to its junction with the Thames at Isleworth.</p>  <p>It is possible to walk the whole length of the river, going through around half a dozen nature reserves and lots of lovely open spaces as you do so.  There are a number of frustrating physical blockages along the way though and it is still not well signposted. We are working, with CVP and others, to improve the "permeability" of the river valley, for walkers and wildlife alike.</p>  <p>Our main focus is on the lower Crane, between Hounslow Heath and the Thames, and we have done a wide range of projects and small scale improvements here over the years.  We welcome any help and support from the local community and we already have around 450 local members.  Please come and look at our exhibition, upload your own photographs onto our web-site and get more involved in your local river.  New members and volunteers for our work days are especially welcome,</p>  <p>Rob Gray<br /> Chair of FORCE<br /> (Friends of the River Crane Environment)<br /> <a href="http://www.force.org.uk">www.force.org.uk</a></p>
