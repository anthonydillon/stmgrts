    <p>Brilliant case, I just hope people this time people think before they vote.  Without the CPZ our road may well just become a car park.  Having tried many times to not move my car for fear of not being able to park when I got back, I nearly got mugged waiting for a bus.  So think about the consequences of your votes</p>

    <p>How on Earth can Jane claim "Sidney Road currently bears the brunt of the parking problems in St Margarets." I think you will find that Moormead, Godstone &amp; Kenley bear it all, Sydney Road due to the configuration of the street with Houses down one side of the road, most with off street parking for 2 cars + 1 outside, coupled with the smaller housing  population probably are in a much better position than the other roads.</p>  <p>I have lived with situation for over 40 years and managed, say NO to this CPZ after all it only puts more money into the councils coffers without even a guaranteed parking space.</p>  <p>Please remember the Liberal Council have no thought for the general rate payers, only to make even more money out of us by parking regulations, To put up council tax up as they have done in this economic climate clearly shows thay have no graps of the real world of today, the sooner they are voted out the better.</p>

    <p>Alsie, I&#39;ve been your neighbour for over 30 years and I agree the parking in Moormead, Godstone, and Kenley is indisputably appalling.  I encourage you to do something about it, as we are trying to do in Sidney road.  I&#39;ll happily help you.</p>  <p>However, in my opinion your points are slightly mistaken.  I don&#39;t know of a single house in Sidney road with off-street parking for two cars, and there no parking across driveways.  Also, I agree the housing density is less in Sidney road, though that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean we own fewer cars.</p>  <p>However, we&#39;re not looking for guaranteed parking spots.  We&#39;re not looking to stop people from Godstone parking in Sidney road.  We primarily want to stop non-St. Margarets residents from using Sidney road as a commuter car park - a convenient place to leave a car close to the station - at the expense of Sidney road residents&#39; parking.  The only option open to us is the CPZ.</p>  <p>And as for boycotting the CPZ to stop filling the council&#39;s coffers, that is a political point, not a social one.  Overthrow the council if you like, but please do not enfranchise Sidney road to make your point, especially against our will.</p>  <p>Vive la revolution, Alsie.  Here&#39;s to the next 30 years.</p>

    <p>I agree entirely with Alsie. If the whole of St Margarets goes into CPZ ,we will be in exactly the same position as we were 5 years ago except we will be paying for it !This is a money -making scam disguised as a parking issue. Shame about the wardens in uniform often seen lying prone on the ground to photograph a car parked outside the designated area. Do residents really want to pay for more of that ?   Jill T</p>

    <p>Well, Jill and Alsie will be voting against CPZ then. Both ladies seem to have forgotten that CPZ was not imposed by our council but asked for by fellow residents in the knowledge that they would have to pay. There has however a money making scam been introduced by the council by linking cost of parking permits to CO2 emissions initially and once that was accepted by Richmond residents the CO2 link increase will now be extended to all council of street car parks. (Unless residents revolt!)</p>  <p>I question the sincerity of our councillors stance on reducing CO2 emissions in the borough. At stage 1 consultation St Peters Road voted 80% for CPZ but was excluded from stage 2 because councillors decided it was to far from Orchard Road. As a consequence St Georges Road as an adjacent Road was also excluded. Too far from Orchard Road??? No more than 5 Minutes along the A316, a Red Route that extends into Ailsa and St Georges Road. Is the council not interested in removing commuter parking and the associated CO2 emissions. Obviously not! I say the real reason for not including St Peters Road and possibly St Georges Road is that most properties there have ample off street parking and there for very few parking permits would be bought.</p>  <p>CO2 emissions from commuter cars are suddenly ignored by our councillors despite residents voting overwhelmingly for CPZ!!!!!!</p>  <p>Commuter parking in that area has increased noticably since the CPZ extension south of the A316 came into force and no doubt residents there will look toward CPZ in increasing numbers in the not to distant future.</p>  <p>A rolling program of repeat consultations, keeping expensive Consultants employed by the council busy in future.</p>

    <p>Hopefully we can all agree that the Mayor/Borough&#39;s initiative to increase car club membership by getting (74) more cars out there is touching our corner of the Borough - the Streetcar space in Broadway Avenue was marked-out yesterday and there are/will be other new Streetcar spaces in Claremont Road and Cambridge Road. I suspect that quite a few second cars could be removed from our streets if more peoople signed up to car clubs and planned journeys a little in advance, which would help the parking problem. And, no, I don&#39;t have a car at all.</p>

    <p>Jane,</p>  <p>I had a walk down Sydney Road today, and with the exception of 2 driveways the rest can park 2 cars in the driveway with no problem at all, also with no yellow line in front of them it means that their Family members, Builders, Doctor, Friends, Visitors etc, can park in front of them.</p>  <p>This is a luxury that only Sydney Road has, and means that 7 houses can accommodate at some time during the day a total of 21 vehicles, have you ever asked if you could share a space during those hours?, as most of them were empty during the daytime when I walked by, a luxury indeed for you residents of that road.</p>  <p>That does therefore mean that the statement that "Sydney Road bears the brunt of the parking problems in St Margarets" is not correct.</p>  <p>Why do you and I, and every council tax payer pay for the Civic Centre council workers car parking fees in Waitroses car park every working day, Why should council workers from outside the area get free parking at our expense, That&#39;s why I object to paying for a CPZ, make it a CPZ by all means just to cure a few problems during the daytime, it won&#39;t cure the problem at night, but pay for it? NO! we already pay through the nose to this inept council.</p>

    <p>Alsie, if you live in an uncontrolled Street you are permitted to own and registre as many vehicles as you like by law without any impact on your wallet. Residents that have purchased a property with off street parking paid a premium for what you call a luxury. The fact that they have sacrificed their front garden to park 2 vehicles off road adds to the over all parking capacity of the street and should be applauded. Outside CPZ areas no yellow lines are painted in front of cross overs but the owner can ring the authority if the cross over is blocked by an authorised vehicle and a traffic warden will come out and issue a penalty charge notice. Unfortunately the authority has no legal right to remove the offending vehicle, rendering the three parking spaces useless for the occupants of the property.</p>

    <p>To add Alsie, yellow lines are being painted across driveways in Sidney road imminently.</p>  <p>You must be a far better parker than I, because I still don&#39;t see these two bay driveways that you have discovered.</p>  <p>Could the problem be that I&#39;m looking at Sidney road, not Sydney road?</p>

    <p>Sidney, I hope you are joking. Yellow lines on cross overs? That will potentialy worsen the parking problem for the residents there.</p>
