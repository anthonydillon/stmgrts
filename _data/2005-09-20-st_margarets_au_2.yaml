    <p>Hello Jake Thankyou for asking about my family. I do have a lot of brothers and sisters but none live nearby.<br /> Did you know that Molly who won Top Dog in the show has a brother and he was judged to be the  Scruffiest Dog in the same contest? So you just can&#39;t tell.</p>

    <p>I would also like to say a BIG THANK YOU to Truske Wright who helped with the dog show and without whose help, there would have been no dog show!</p>
