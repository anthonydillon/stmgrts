    <p>I am very excited about the new library. I run a local business called Essential Basics. It is for adults and children and uses drama techniques to improve life, presenting and communication skills. I once got 300 children to learn poems and bits of prose to take a LAMDA exam.I feel the library is a crucial part of the community and therfore I am offering my services for FREE. I can either run a drama workshop for adults or children. I have just stopped a storytelling group in Richmond so I am also available to help out with storytelling if required. I have worked in televsion and theatre and local radio.</p>  <p>If you ever need my services please call.</p>  <p>Lizzie</p>
