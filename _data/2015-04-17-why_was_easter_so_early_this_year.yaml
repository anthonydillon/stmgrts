    <p>First it was comforting to learn I have both the first and second best books in the world. Any thoughts on number 3 anyone?</p>  <p>Second, that debate.  Sturgeon is effective at simple messages - Independent Scotland, Kick out the Tories - horrible nationalism (yet she likes being in the EU?), Natalie sounds cool on a good day, but Leanne Wood?  OH COME ON!.</p>  <p>Third. long may our wierd movable Easter be a thorn in the side of the Corporates.  325 eh?, now that is playing a long game.</p>

    <p>Martyn, we got there before the Vatican. Under the Easter Act, passed by the UK Parliament in 1928 but not yet implemented, a fixed date for Easter is provided rather than the current moveable feast. Let&#39;s get on with it! (and leave Leanne alone :))</p>

    <p>If I was obliged to name a third &#39;best book&#39; - something to take with me perhaps to a desert island or an equally lonely, isolated spot like the Ivy Bridge bus stop waiting for a 267 to take me into Twickenham, I might choose "Other Men&#39;s Flowers&#39; compiled by Field- Marshal Wavell. It contains most of my favourite poems apart from the one by A.A Milne that starts... "The King asked The Queen, and The Queen asked The Dairymaid:</p>  <p>"Could we have some butter for The Royal slice of bread?" The Queen asked the Dairymaid, The Dairymaid Said, "Certainly, I&#39;ll go and tell the cow Now Before she goes to bed."</p>  <p>....but you can&#39;t have everything, as the King soon discovered.</p>
