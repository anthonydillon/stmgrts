    <p>In late February water board contractors breached  what appears to be the roof of Earl of Kilmoreys Tunnel under Kilmorey Road west of the junction with Kilmorey Gardens. The hole is only about 12 inches in diameter, not much can be seen from the road. The depth of the hole is just over 7 feet measured from the road surface. The road has not been re instated yet,Wednesday 9<sup>th</sup> March 2011.</p>
