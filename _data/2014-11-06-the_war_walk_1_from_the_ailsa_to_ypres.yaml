    <p>Thank you Martyn, the residents of Isleworth and St Margarets are indebted to you and others who have carried out this wonderful research.<br /> Reginald Fredericks lived in my house (which still resembles a laundry at times!) 100 years ago, and was about the same age went he left St Margarets to go to war as many of the children are who live and play in this street today. He must have been one of the 250,000 boys under the age of 19, the legal limit for armed service overseas, who lied about their age in order to fight for their country.<br /> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/zcvdhyc">www.bbc.co.uk/guides/zcvdhyc</a> has more on how this horrible situation was allowed to go &#39;unnoticed&#39; for so long.</p>
