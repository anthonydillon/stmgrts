    <p>I think it is fundamentally wrong that people who are financially worse off than the majority, in our borough, should be exposed to such a punitive and retrograde step. 5% may seem a very small amount to the average person, but to those who are on low incomes, it represents a significant claw back.</p>  <p>We have the good fortune to live in a very comfortable neighbourhood, I would be deeply saddened if people considerably worse off than us, who have no budget for discretionary spending, suffered as a consequence of such a selfish decision. I hope we are collectively better than that.</p>
