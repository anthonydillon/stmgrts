    <p>[Jun 23] Bryan Staff, LBRuT Senior Planning Officer writes:  &#39;THE new application at Twickenham Station has now been validated. However, as we are still awaiting further information on the Environmental Statement, we have suspended the application. Formal consultation with residents, etc., will take place once this has been received.</p>  <p>As the application has been validated, the public can access the electronic file on the Council&#39;s website. There is however a statement informing the public that whilst documents are available to view, formal consultation will not start until the outstanding information is submitted.  A link to a letter setting out this outstanding information will also be published very soon. The expected decision date published on the web site will also be removed so as to avoid any confusion. When we are in a position to consult on this application, I will explain in the consultation letter the status of the three applications and the reason behind their submission.&#39;</p>
