    <p>Hello from Forgetmenot Flowers<br /> Thanks for all your comments, we really appreciate them.<br /> Peter is correct that there is no shop. We are a flower delivery service. We supply fantastically fresh seasonal flower bouquets by going directly to the flower market at the crack of dawn, making and delivering the bouquets the very same day.<br /> This is the only way to ensure that your flowers are absolutely fresh and at their peak rather than sitting around in a shop.</p>  <p>Both of us live locally, in St Margarets and Old Isleworth.<br /> Despite being a new company we already have many orders and we had a launch party last week which was wonderful, and our guests and customers are delighted with our bouquets which offer beautiful seasonal flowers at very good prices.</p>  <p>We deliver weekly and monthly bouquets as well as one off bouquets (with 2 days notice), and for the festive season we provide a fabulous Christmas Decoration service in which we decorate your home or work place with garlands, wreaths, bouquets and festive yuletide arrangements, including table and mantle decorations. We also deliver Christmas Bouquets up to mid-day on Christmas Eve.</p>  <p>Roisin and Elle<br /> Forgetmenot Flowers<br /> <a href="http://www.forgetmenotflowersdelivery.co.uk">www.forgetmenotflowersdelivery.co.uk</a><br /> Tel: 0845 680 9081</p>

    <p>I placed an order in 2010 - seemed like a great idea and good value for four deliveries.</p>  <p>Sadly only the first delivery was made and even at that point the email was not connecting.  I have been unable to contact since, and the website address keeps redirecting to google.  Of you are still there, please let me know how to get you! Thanks.</p>
