    <p>Thank you for that useful and equally informative piece. The very amusing tone was a bonus!!</p>  <p>Japanese Knotweed was reported as being a problem in the Crane Valley area 4+ years ago.I under- stood Thames Arcadia (Jason Debney&#39;s team)were addressing the problem then.<br /> If someone could show a large scale image for identification purposes that would be most helpful</p>  <p>Annie</p>

    <p>Credit for tackling the Crane valley knot-weed should go to to our own excellent and hard-working environmental charity, Friends of the River Crane Environment [FORCE: <a href="http://www.force.org.uk/">www.force.org.uk/]</a>] See the report on the &#39;Mereway Nature Park&#39;.</p>
