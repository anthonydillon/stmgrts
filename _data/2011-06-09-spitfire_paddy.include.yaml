    <p>My mother was Jean Woolford, fiancee of Paddy Finucane.</p>  <p>I have a lot of newspaper clippings of Paddy from that time.</p>  <p>I will be in Kew/Richmond in September for my son&#39;s wedding so would like to know if there is anywhere that I should go to see more information on the above.</p>

    <p>Dear Ms Shale, I have recently been researching the life and career of &#39;Paddy&#39; Finucane. In my research, I found the ladies at the Richmond Resource Centre, at Richmond Library very helpful. They have a small collection of press cuttings and literature there relating to &#39;Paddy&#39; Finucane&#39;s career. His W/Cdr&#39;s uniform, decorations and portrait are on permanent display in the Battle of Britain Hall at the RAF Museum at Hendon, in London. In addition, his name is commemorated on panel 64 of the RAF Memorial to missing airmen at Runnymede, near Windsor. You will also find his name engraved on the Battle of Britain memorial on Victoria Embankment in Westminster.</p>  <p>The photographic collection of the Imperial War Museum holds a number of collections of photographs featuring him, which are available to view by appointment. I have catalogue references of a number of these, if you would like to progress this further. You could contact me at &lt; <a href="mailto:hanlons55@ntlworld.com&amp;gt">hanlons55@ntlworld.com</a>; if I can be of any further help.</p>  <p>Gerry Hanlon</p>

    <p>Hello Ms Shale and Mr Hanlon,</p>  <p>I am sure you are already aware of Brendan&#39;s address at 26 Castlegate and I believe Jean Woolford lived two doors down (possibly number 22?). Also, Finucane Court in Richmond Road and the Finucane Wing at Richmond hospital are both named after the great man.</p>  <p>I was so pleased to see these posts as Brendan and Jean were effectively becoming the &#39;posh and Becks&#39; of the 1940&#39;s and were a really celebrated couple.</p>  <p>Oh, incidentally, last time I went to Hendon (a few months ago now) the uniform had been removed due to renovations so I&#39;d advise checking in advance. However, its a great place and entrance is free so its worth a day out if you can make it.</p>  <p>Anyway, I too have been trying to research Brendan&#39;s tragically short life and whilst I would not seek to impose, it would be really great to hear any views that your mum had, or stories that she may have told you etc. I always felt that there was so little information about your mum yet she was obviously a great part of Brendan&#39;s life and I am sure his passing must have really affected her.</p>  <p>It would be graet to have them written down or posted just for posterity. You may be aware that there are lots of Finucane relatives still living and searching for details of Brendan&#39;s life and I can really feel a resurgence of interest happening.</p>  <p>My dream is to write a film about his life and his engagement to your mum but in all honesty it is probably something I will never get around to doing.</p>  <p>Finally, there is a chap in New Zealand that recently wrote a romantic fiction book because of a dream he had where Brendan was flying over a small house and there was a lady waving up to him. I know Brendan flew over Castlegate and his brothers saw himn from the back garden so its not too far a leap to wonder if the lady in the dream was your mum.</p>  <p>I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t remember the name of the book for the life of me at the moment.</p>  <p>There are three other books which I am sure you are aware of: (1) Paddy Finucane Fighter Ace by Doug Stokes (2) Paddy Finucane a memorial by James Reynolds and (3) Paddy Finucane Combat Diary (cannot recall authors name at present). All are these are usually pretty expensive to buy - even second hand used copies are thirty pounds or more.</p>  <p>The Imperial War Museum also has his personal papers and two of the above books as well as lots of gun camera footage and a few press reels. All you need to do is contact them and book an appointment as Gerry said above.</p>  <p>Theres also a wonderful article by Maurice Byrne online and an interview with Brendan both of which are easily found online.</p>  <p>Anyway, I&#39;ll stop rattling on now but its really great that you are interested in this and I hope that you have a really interesting and amazing trip to Richmond in September.</p>  <p>I&#39;m happy to send either of you the few electronic copies of pictures etc that I have.</p>  <p>Hope that helps.</p>  <p>Kind regards,</p>  <p>John</p>  <p>PS I think from memory your mum worked in Kingsway (air ministry?) and Brendan briefly worked in Regents Street in case you are in central london.</p>

    <p>Hello! Very interesting!! As a young lad growing up in Dublin I used to read everything I could get my hands on regarding WW2 aviation and fighter pilots in particular. I had never heard of Paddy until I was in my early twenties.</p>  <p>There are many images of both him and his Spitfires on line, a simple Google search will find them all EXCEPT one: BM308 in which he was lost. His aircraft carried the usual Shamrock crest on the left side except that this one was painted by the same Cuthbert Orde who produced all those wonderful RAF portraits. Does anyone have a photo of this?</p>  <p>Although I&#39;ve been a bit specific, I&#39;ll take any information I can get.</p>  <p>My email address is flyinmick at hotmail.com</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>  <p>Alan</p>

    <p>I was delighted to come across this article and discussion. I want to let you all know about the second Isleworth Community Play, We Can Do It! , which is in it sixth week of rehearsal. It is set in WWII and features five central characters, one of whom is flying ace, Brendan Finucane. I learnt about Brendan when I was interviewing Twickenham resident and ex-Gumley girl, Freda Hammerton, as part of my research. Freda told me she met a boy on the riverbank one summer afternoon when she was out in her boat on the Thames, and he told her his brother was the famous fighter pilot, &#39;Paddy&#39; Finucane. I had never heard of him, so it set me off on another research trail. I subsequently found out the boy she spoke to was Kevin Finucane and I listened to a fantastic 30 minute RTE radio programme where Kevin revisits Dublin and the places Brendan was born and went to school. It also has recordings of interviews with Brendan and some of his co-pilots. As a result of this research, and being very touched by Brendan&#39;s story, I wrote him into our play, re-imagining that encounter on the river, Brendan&#39;s early days as a pilot, the fateful day he makes his final flight, the bad news being delivered to his mother, and, finally, him and young Ray in 1932 about to take their first flight at the airshow. The play pays tribute to Brendan Finucane and other known and unknown brave hearts who lived and died during the war. There is a song specially about him called The Ballad of Brendan Finucane. I would like to invite all of you to come and see our play. It is on the 19th, 21st and 22nd March at Gumley House School with a community cast of 62 people aged from 6 to 80! Please contact me if you would like to know more and check out our tumblr site at <a href="http://isleworthplay.tumblr.com">isleworthplay.tumblr.com</a> to see photos blogs about the process. My mobile is 07827964327 Best wishes Madeleine Casey</p>

    <p>Seventy Three Years ago today but still remembered.</p>  <p>A truly remarkable and inspiring young man, quiet, humble, of strong faith, a true leader of men and a pilot&#39;s pilot. The youngest RAF Wing Commander flying, leading the largest Ramrod operation of the war at that time, loved by his pilots and ground crew, highly decorated and highly respected. Did not want publicity, did not care about medals or totals, he only wanted to get his pilots home safe. Never forgot his roots or his family and sent money home to help his family and all this at the age of just 21.</p>  <p>He would have been 94 going on 95 now and has been a shining inspiration throughout my life.</p>
