    <p>I learnt yesterday at a meeting of the River Thames Society that the Old Deer Park only became open to the public in 1894 when the Borough Council took a lease on it from &#39;The Crown&#39;. The lease is up for renewal in the next decade, probably in 2019, 125 years from 1894. I wonder what terms will be offered and would not be surprised if some &#39;enabling development&#39; of riverside flats is needed to fund a new lease.</p>

    <p>If there&#39;s genuine fear of&#39;enabling development&#39; then WE had better get our house in order NOW &amp; make our demand for RETENTION of this historical OPEN SPACE.Was it a sneer or lament that Old Deer Park hardly justified description as &#39;majestic&#39;. I agree football pitches under &#39;dual use of Open Spaces&#39; does detract but that&#39;s the downside of over population &amp; recent legislation. Even so those magnificent Wellington Evergreens provide a wonderful statement in that expanse of English riverside landscape.Perhaps it should become another of this boroughs&#39; Protected Views,as that will ensure no further encroachment. Not only local residents but many thousands of people enjoy that view as they drive through the borough. It provides relief of frustration of the usual traffic congestion!</p>

    <p>I disagree that the footbal pitches detract. They are useful and provide as much recreation as any part of Richmond Park. The open space is surely Metropolitan Open Land and will not be developed. The terms of the lease are a different issue. The rents for sports clubs may become prohibitive if the lease is at commercial rates so pressure on the Crown Estates to moderate their demands may be required.</p>

    <p>For me Old Deer Park was just across the Bridge and we could see the Pagoda at Kew in the distance.   Memories of Rugby being played there;  the Fair across the road and my dear Grandfather helped arrange the Richmond Royal Horse Show too - I still have a programme from one event we went to.  It will be sacriledge if the Park is churned up, like the Skating Rink was by the River and all it did was create more untidy looking  flats and a few tennis courts. That also provided a wonderful venue for young and old to get together  and appreciate a sport and it  kept the youngsters off the streets. I was born in St. Margaret&#39;s and treasure all of my 72 years with memories of the whole area from Kew to Hampton Court and what open spaces are left should be retained.   What next, Richmond Green to go as well???? - I can see Sir Richard Attenborough agreeing to that one!!   My Grandfather also played bowls at Cambridge Park - I least that too is still there and wonderful Marble Hill Park. I hope some one sees common sense.   Patricia Hammond</p>
