    <p>Today and yesterday, tesco had lorries parked in the bus stop. This prevented buses from unloading passengers at the bus stop, forcing buses to use the crossing as a bus stop. This has been going on for too long. I would be very keen to attend the meeting to hear what tesco have to say on the matter and to hear why our councillors have not resolved this issue. Unfortunately I can not attend the meeting (5.30 &amp; a week before Christmas is not good for me).</p>

    <p>What a ridiculous time to have a meeting 5.30pm on the last Monday before Christmas. Anybody who works or has children probably won&#39;t be able to make it. Are the Councillors and Tesco really serious about effective community relations? Or are they just going to ignore us again. We all know Tesco continue to unload at the bus stop and that the Council fail to do any thing about it what more is there to discuss.</p>

    <p>06:15 (am) on Saturday 2 December, the newspaper delivery van for Tescos parked in the bus stop. The driver/deliverer was too lazy to walk the extra 5 yards that parking in the delivery bay (which was clear) would have involved. The lady from Tescos who dealt with him did not say a word.</p>

    <p>Lots of issues Tesco cause. I think the council have made a major error in holding a meeting that nobody can attend. The meeting should be held after Christmas when people have more time. Or was this meeting arranged hoping that nobody would be able to attend.</p>

    <p>It is disappointing to read some of the comments above. There was nothing devious about the timing of the meeting or the intentions of the 3 ward councillors who continue to be as flexible and helpfull as possible.</p>  <p>The facts were that the Tesco reps could not make it later in the day (and we had asked and looked at various dates) also Julie the Tesco rep who has been dealing with this issue is due to leave for another job after Christmas so for the sake of continuity and to avoid having to deal with a totally "new" person it was decided for the date that it was.</p>  <p>However since it seems not convenient for the interested parties we will cancel the above meeting and hope we can achieve more in the new year with the new Tesco Rep when he/she is in place.</p>  <p>Cllr Ben Khosa</p>

    <p>Ben, Given the examples of this week - why are you still not taking action against tesco. You have a legal obligation to enforce the restrictions outside tesco. You seem to be more interested in giving tickets to residents who are prehaps a few minutes over their parking time in Crown Road, whilst tesco prevent buses using the bus stop and force them to unload passengers in the middle of the road. The council have held meeting after meeting with tesco, why are you not taking action?</p>

    <p>No doubt others have noticed that Tesco have recently submitted a planning application to alter their fascia? Available on the LB Richmond site.</p>
