    <p>So Sorry to hear of your missing pet. Do hope you find him. Have you registered report with HAWS / PAWS / RCPCA Putney and Battersea?</p>  <p>Ironically - our Jazzpurr - Cream/Ginger British Shorthair also went missing 19JUL07. He has been microchipped, neutered and wears colar with tag &amp; bell. It is very odd as he never leaves the immediate proximity (Kilmorey Gardens).</p>  <p>Has anyone seen him or any unusual cars/vans driving through the neighbourhoods?</p>  <p>May we kindly ask you to check garden sheds in case he may be locked in?</p>  <p>Many Thanks Susanne</p>

    <p>My cat was also neutered and chipped and he disappeared on the 18th July. Lets keep our fingers crossed. By the way my number is 02088911275 not 02078911275</p>

    <p>My cat has been found by somebody in beaconsfield road. Which is fantastic. So good luck with yours. I found keeping putting posters up was what really helped.</p>
