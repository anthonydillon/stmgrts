    <p>The Park now seems to have a new nane, according to the central piece of rotating seating kit placed therein, namely; MOORHEAD PARK.  This, if not carved in stone, is certaily drilled in steel, so will it be fixed??  I&#39;ve called the council parks dept to draw this to their attention.  They seemed concerned,  but what will be done about it? If it&#39;s a contractor problem doubtless it will be sorted but if it&#39;s a council error will it be adressed or will we continue to have have a new name for our beloved Moormead?  Keep on the case for us please!!</p>

    <p>The website has been on the case and Hamish Waugh from the council has confirmed the sign will be replaced next week with the correct name. Thanks for letting us know.</p>
