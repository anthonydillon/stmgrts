    <p>Hello Adrienne,<br /> At what level of French are the members of your group?<br /> We own an apt. on the Mediterranean but my French is weaker now<br /> that we do not live there so I would like to improve it.</p>  <p>Best regards,<br /> Kathleen Cornelia</p>

    <p>Hi Kathleen</p>  <p>Please don&#39;t worry. Most people are concerned before they join that their French may not be good enough. But really if you can hold a conversation, however (in)accurately, you should be fine! :)</p>  <p>Why don&#39;t you email me with a good number to call you on and we can discuss further at your convenience:  <a href="mailto:%69%6E%66%6F%6C%69%76%65%6C%61%6E%67%75%61%67%65%73%40%67%6D%61%69%6C%2E%63%6F%6D">infolivelanguages@gmail.com</a>?</p>  <p>Merci beaucoup,<br /> Adrienne</p>
