    <p>I had the pleasure of meeting Trevor Baylis briefly a couple of times, years ago; he was indeed a delightful, unassuming man, just as so well described above.  I hope that Richmond Council, based in Twickenham as it is, will make an effort to honour him in some way, and to ensure he is not forgotten; his wind-up radio was more than deserving of the CBE he was awarded.</p>
