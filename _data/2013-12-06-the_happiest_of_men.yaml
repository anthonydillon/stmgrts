    <p>Thanks for this. The history of Cambridge Park is told in detail in two Papers, nos. 63 and 68, by Maureen Bunch, published by the Twickenham Local History Society <a href="http://botlhs.co.uk/portfolio/cambridge-park-east-twickenham-the-building-of-a-suburb/">botlhs.co.uk/portfolio/cambridge-park-east-twickenham-the-building-of-a-suburb/.</a>. No. 68 includes maps from 1846, 1894 and 1935.</p>  <p>The estate was first divided with the sale of Cambridge House in 1835 by Cambridge&#39;s son, who had built himself another house, the Old Warren/Meadowbank on the site which became the Exiles Club and is now Linde House.</p>
