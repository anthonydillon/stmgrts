    <p>Nice to see that a fellow American has discovered the wonderous town of St. Margarets.  Someday it will be my home, but for now, it suffices to be my "home away from home" when I visit my fiance&#39; while he awaits word on a green card admission.  Luckily, St. Margarets will be the place we wed and hold our reception in September. Miss everything there.</p>
