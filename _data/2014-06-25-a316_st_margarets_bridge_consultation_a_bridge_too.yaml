    <p>Update:</p>  <p>In light of resident concerns, Cllr Ben Khosa asked TfL for the consultation period to be extended so that fuller consultation could take place and more views from the community could be collected.</p>  <p>Our primary request of TfL is the withdrawal of this consultation, but the request for more time provided a useful back-up if TfL could not be moved further.</p>  <p>Yesterday, we heard that TfL have decided to extend the consultation as an interim measure and are discussing the consultation more fully, next week. This  two week extension to the consultation doesn&#39;t address the core concerns of local people, but TfL seem to have recognised the consultation has deficiencies, which is an achievement in itself.</p>  <p>We as your Councillors will continue to ask for a face to face and/or a public meeting with TfL so we can put parents concerns and  strength of feelings to them first hand and explore alternatives to the consultation&#39;s proposal.</p>  <p>Please keep up the pressure on TfL and sign the 500+ strong petition at: <a href="https://www.change.org/en-GB/petitions/transport-for-london-withdraw-the-consultation-calling-for-the-removal-of-the-existing-st-margaret-s-footbridge-over-the-a316-and-its-replacement-with-toucan-crossings">www.change.org/en-GB/petitions/transport-for-london-withdraw-the-consultation-calling-for-the-removal-of-the-existing-st-margaret-s-footbridge-over-the-a316-and-its-replacement-with-toucan-crossings</a></p>
