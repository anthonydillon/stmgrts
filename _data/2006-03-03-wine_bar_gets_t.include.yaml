    <p>Thank you for your fair and accurate report on the proceedings re this Planning  Application. I hope people will appreciate the Applicants presented their case very well and had it been refused by Committee the Applicant, using his right to Appeal would have been successful.</p>  <p>As discussed, there were no grounds under Planning Law for REFUSAL &amp; the Council would have been responsible for costs.</p>  <p>There were objections but there were also many who favoured the idea of &#39;a little sophistication coming to St Margarets&#39; instead of them having to travel elsewhere.</p>  <p>I certainly feel there are many females in the area who will feel encouraged by this less male dominated style of &#39;drinking hole&#39; which hopefully will contribute to wider social networking .</p>  <p>It will be in everyone&#39;s interest for it to be successful and with least inconvenience for those in the immediate vicinity .</p>  <p>As I believed when Tesco invaded the area &#39; the market will decide &#39;.</p>  <p>I wish the owners &#39;Good Luck&#39;</p>  <p>Councillor Annie Hambidge Ward Cllr. St Margarets &amp; North Twickenham</p>

    <p>Further to Annie&#39;s comments.</p>  <p>As one of main opposers to the application I would like to particularly thank our other local councillors, Simon Lamb and David Porter for their support.  Councillor Lamb asked the applicants and others all the right questions at the meeting.  I&#39;m sure the minutes of the meeting will fairly reflect the answers given to those questions and the response of the councillors and the planning officer.</p>  <p>Many thanks to the 561 people who registered their objection in one way or another, including Vincent Cable and Tony Arbour the council leader.</p>  <p>We look forward to returning to York House as and when the planning committee meet to discuss the applied conditions before giving final approval. And whatever the outcome there have to be winners and loosers if you want to enjoy the benefits of living in a democracy.</p>  <p>Harry Jacobs. Broadway Avenue</p>

    <p>Many people feel that the problem with this wine bar is that it is just too big. At 450 square metres it is bigger than Richmond swimming pool. Situated as it is under Tesco it is also in what has become a traffic blackspot.</p>  <p>Hundreds of people signed a petition to this effect.</p>  <p>But as Harry says we live in a democracy and the council will make the decision they feel is right for the community, in accordance with planning laws.</p>

    <p>I think it&#39;s pretty depressing that one of Cllr Hambridge&#39;s main criteria for voting in favour of the wine bar should be potential cost exposure for the council!  It seems that her views are entirely sympathetic with those of the owner of the planned wine bar and not with the overwhelming majority of local people who didn&#39;t want it.</p>  <p>I attended the planning meeting and Cllr Hambridge&#39;s questions and comments never once reflected the concerns of local people who will be impacted by the wine bar.  Indeed when another councillor, Simon Lamb, voiced his concern over the noise that will be caused by people after leaving the wine bar, Cllr Hambridge said that sound-proofing would take care of this.  This was sadly consistent with her general lack of understanding of the situation.</p>  <p>Since the meeting, I have spoken with dozens of residents who leave within the immediate catchment area of the wine bar and none are in favour.  The ones who spoke out in favour at the planning meeting (including the main director) all live at least half a mile away so won&#39;t be effected by the environmental impact.  Cllr Hambridge, please represent the views of local people - those who elected you - and please don&#39;t tell me what is in my interests. This wine bar isn&#39;t.</p>

    <p>I read with great interest Councillor Annie Hambridge&#39;s views on the St Margarets wine bar and hope I can count on her support for a little business venture of my own. I plan to set up a small stall selling recreational drugs to the local children on their way to school. Please encourage your offspring to use my services as it will avoid the need for them to travel out of the immediate area and its popularity will, according to the councillor, make it legitimate. If my venture proves successful I will consider widening my clientele to include all those local women who feel too threatened to enter any of the &#39;St Margarets drinking holes&#39;. I am not sure if it will supply the sophistication Councillor Hambridge feels St Margarets so badly needs....you decide.</p>

    <p>The people of St.Margarets have spoken at the ballot box and Councillor Annie Hambidge is no more.. where can she drown her sorrows? There&#39;s no wine bar and the watering holes of St.Margarets are like the streets of Basra, my heart bleeds!!!</p>
