    <p>I think it is well established by now that not being able to obtain a permit to park in a CPZ will not stop residents to own/ register a vehicle while</p>  <p>a) there are areas within easy walking distance that have no CPZ and free parking is available 24/ 7</p>  <p>b) CPZ`s are not relevant between at best 6:30 pm and 8:30 am. when pressure on on street parking is greatest.</p>

    <p>I don&#39;t understand this, surely at some point in the future it will be deemed necessary to provide some kind of access to parking to these residents.  It is hardly fair otherwise.</p>  <p>This will at best be temporary.</p>

    <p>Peter: not at all. I anticipate that, following the example of the Air Sea House, Third Cross Road, development controversially approved by the planning committee last week [in a meeting that lasted 5 &#189; hours], all the flats will be required to be permanent members of a Car Club [see report on application 10/0612 p. 19] for which spaces will be reserved. So there will never be provision for parking privately owned cars.</p>
