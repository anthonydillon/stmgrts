    <p>What a fantastic venue. Just what is needed to provide something other than the run of the mill gastro bars. Really great food and wine.</p>  <p>Ialso found the website gave a great insight into the atmosphere of the bar.... <a href="http://www.parvinuatphelps.com">www.parvinuatphelps.com</a></p>

    <p>Lovely venue but horribly smoky due to open kitchen. The waitresses were very good, main courses and wine great, but we had a few problems with our desserts and coffees - the cheese board lacked much of the advertised content, the hot chocolate sauce was cold and the fresh tea was little more than one or two fresh mint leaves in water, and rather than being pleasant and apologising, one of the male waiters (the owner we believe) was terribly rude and aggressive. He kindly but unnecessarily took the desserts and drinks off the bill, when in fact a little humility would have done the job much more adequately. My partner and i left angry and what should have been a lovely evening was ruined by our aggressive encounter with this chap.</p>

    <p>I went to Parvinu last night, it was my 54th birthday and we arrived as a group four couples at 8.00 p.m.  To cut a long story short, the atmosphere was buzzing but the meas and service were dreadful.  Our main courses eventually arrived at 10.30.  Out of the eight mains, six were awful and the average price of a main course was &pound;20.  My starter was three good sized prawns but without any of the chillie dressing that had been promised. I had sea bass as my main course, which arrived after an hours wait overcooked, dry, tastless and accompanied by one and a half boiled potatoes and nothing else. The sea bass course was &pound;22.50. I ate mine, because I never send food back (I just don&#39;t return), but three others returned their food.</p>  <p>We skipped the manager&#39;s offer of free deserts because we assumed they would probably have tasted foul. After much deliberation with the "management" the bill was reduced to &pound;150 so I guess we should be grateful that the management realised how hopeless they were and deducted about &pound;170 from the bill by.  As we left the "manager" said "please don&#39;t come back"...well don&#39;t worry, we never will.  It&#39;s a shame that with so many restaurants going through hard times, this one is still in business.</p>  <p>To sum up, the ambience and setting is great but the food, the service and the prices were a bad joke.</p>

    <p>I see Parvinu is "closed for the Summer months", following its restricting opening to evenings only, 5 days a week. Wonder if the recession/the opening of Brocca have hit business hard?</p>

    <p>That might explain why the website remains not-updated with the news.</p>
