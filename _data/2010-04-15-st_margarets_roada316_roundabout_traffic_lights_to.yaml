    <p>Increase the pedestrian crossing time and you increase the tailback traffic through the village - more fumes, more congestion ??</p>

    <p>Why do the entire traffic light units need to be replaced when it was just a re-timing that was mooted - surely just a simple software change?</p>  <p>How much is this going to cost?</p>

    <p>Surely these works are being done for Transport for London, and not the local council. It would be nice to think that the lights, if upgraded, will be able to be adjusted more easily or programmed more efficiently, as traffic and pedestrian flows around this roundabout are extremely complex and variable.</p>  <p>Certainly the pedestrian lights on the northbound carriageway of St Margarets Road near Dexters are dangerous to the extent that it is often safer to cross the road further north without lights, and anything which makes them more visible would be welcomed.</p>  <p>As always, whatever you do on this junction will please some people and not others!</p>

    <p>From conversation with one of the workman:</p>  <p>When Tfl want to upgrade lights they have to be sanctioned by RBC.<br /> Wages for a couple of navvies for this period of time about 10k. (there are about 6-7 working there including a foreman.)<br /> Poles x 34 at about &pound;100-150 each.<br /> New light sets, sensors, replacing damaged railings.etc, etc.<br /> I hate to imagine the magnitude of costs involved. At least it is being funded mainly by Tfl - oops no sorry - it is being funded by you, the ever generous tax-payer.</p>

    <p>Well what fine value-for-money these new lights were ... at least half-a-dozen bulbs on them have blown already, and they are ... errr ... exactly the same as the ones they replaced!</p>
