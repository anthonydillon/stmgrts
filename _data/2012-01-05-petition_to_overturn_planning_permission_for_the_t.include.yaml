    <p>I have never known a planning matter to have overwhelming planning support, very rare. To use this site to lobby for support from people that this development doesn&#39;t effect is a little unsettling ..."The only way that this can be achieved is if you can encourage others to complete the petition (partners, neighbours, family, friends, commuters, residents of Greater London, school parents and rugby fans)" ... thetime for this support is gone and Twickenham needs this development and it to happen in time for the World Cup</p>

    <p>Sorry, but the point you have missed here is that "significant local community support" is required under planning policy for the Council to approve a development on this site where the buildings exceed 4/5 storeys, as Solum&#39;s do. Twickenham needs good development on this site and has registered resounding opposition to "this development". If Solum&#39;s scheme goes ahead Twickenham will be saddled with mediocre buildings for decades for the sake of a few weeks&#39; rugby in 2015. The RFU has been openly pushing this scheme as is attested to by the fact that support for it in the Council&#39;s online case file came from such well known areas of this Borough as, er, Exeter and Peterborough. The truth is that community support for the scheme as a whole has not been demonstrated and that the station improvements used to shoehorn it under the gaze of those rightly desperate for a renewed station (including, quite legitimately, rugby fans) are niggardly and inadequate, maybe even unsafe. Bad scheme, bad bad decision by the Council. Many people are now working hard on an alternative.</p>

    <p>A little perverse to state that because a planning does not have support, that sentiment must be ignored. How about we try something a little different? Give the local population a choice in what they, as residents and people who will have to live with the outcome an option. We have 2 now, Solum&#39;s and Option B (from what I have seen on that website) - I vote Option B is it fits that much better in the area. Accepted probably a little less in potential profits, but frankly - so what.</p>
