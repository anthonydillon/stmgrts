    <p>re:Anti Social Behaviour &amp; Criminal Damage Halloween Trick or Treat does not seem to have been discussed. Several years ago I regularly had eggs thrown at my front windows on 31st Oct, despite the fact I was NOT at home; since then I have put a notice up saying "No Trick or Treat" &amp; the problem seemed to improve. This year I did not get round to putting this notice up &amp; returned at the end of the week having been away all week to the disgusting spectacle of egg covering my front door from top to doorstep! When are the Police &amp; Council going to do something about this menace?</p>

    <p>This is a reply from your local SNT.</p>  <p>From 29th October to 2<sup>nd</sup> November all Twickenham SNT&#39;s were engaged in a pro-active operation over the whole of the areas covered by them. The PCSO&#39;s patrolled being the eyes/ears to call in the police officers should they be required. The officers worked extended hours, many finishing at 2.00 am only to re-parade at noon. During this operation, many youths were stopped and arrests were made. We do not have (and I would say it would be inappropriate if we did) carte blanche to stop/search everyone for eggs that MAY be used to throw.</p>  <p>As the eggs have probably dried, I appreciate that they may be harder to remove than if they were fresh but, as they can still be removed with hot soapy water this would not be classified as a criminal damage. We have noted this and will use it next year to better target our patrols although, given the fact officers were patrolling your road due to its proximity to Moor Mead Park I do not see what more we can do. In partnership with the council, I will look into the possibility of producing similar cards to the one you described for next year.</p>  <p>Should you or anyone wish to raise any topics at the next meeting, we will be advertising it on this site so please attend.</p>  <p>Steve DAVIS PS 2TW St. Margarets Safer Neighbourhood Team</p>
