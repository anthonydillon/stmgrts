    <p>I think it is a disgrace that they are doing away with the very people who actually deliver and help the community. They do the job with one hand tied behind their backs get no thanks from the councillors who only pamper to a very small minority of puffed up local friends/residents.</p>  <p>The job the Town Centre managers have done to date is one that no one at the council is capable of doing and given that Mr Lamb is not a local to St Margarets I suggest he thinks very carefully about his position given the local elections. Incidentally, what has he ever done for us?</p>

    <p>It is said the sackings will save them 10 or &pound;20 thousand, a small amount and even more so when they have just approved spending over &pound;200,000 on lighting up Richmond Bridge<br /> BEN KHOSA</p>

    <p>I am very sad to hear about these sackings. Esther Worboys the Twickenham town centre manager and Karen Pengelly were of enormous help to the organisers of the St Margarets Autumn Fair. Their help and adivice were invaluable and the fair would not have been as good as it was without their help and wealth of experience.</p>
