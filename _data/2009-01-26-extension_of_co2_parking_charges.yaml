    <p>You have no choice but to use smart card technology and register online (one-off fee of &pound;2.50) or pay by mobile phone (at 20p a call) or pay maximum fee no matter what your car emmissions are. Seems a lot of red tape just to park in your local borough. (Also proposals to close the Parking Shop so everything has to be done online or by phone).</p>  <p>What about local shops? It&#39;s fair enough to walk if you are just popping out for a bottle of milk but will you find it easier to do a big shop with parking for free at a supermarket? And this probably won&#39;t do much good to your local butcher, greengrocer, etc. What about the local shops who sell furniture, white goods, tiles, wine? Not everything can be carried home.</p>  <p>What about visitors and shoppers from outside the borough?</p>  <p>I&#39;d also like to know how the council will assess light goods vehicles as this will affect local tradesmen. As I understand it, there is currently no available data on CO2 emissions for light goods vehicles.</p>
