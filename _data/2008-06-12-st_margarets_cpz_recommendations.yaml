    <p>The reaction to the CPZ proposal seems to have un-nerved the Council. The recommendation is now on their site. I have emailed our 2 councillorsas follows:-</p>  <p>Dear Councillors,</p>  <p>I have just read the CPZ report &amp; the recommendation</p>  <ol> <li>RECOMMENDATIONS<br /> 2.1 That the Cabinet Member for Traffic, Transport and Parking approves the implementation of an extension to the St Margarets South CPZ into Bridge Road and Winchester Road, St Margarets<br /> 2.2 That a review of the new CPZ extension is undertaken after a period of operation of six months</li> </ol>  <p>To say that I am gob-smacked is putting it mildly. For anyone living in Cole Park View,Sidney,Godstone, Kenley&amp;  South Western roads the effect will be disastrous. All the following will now be squeezed into an even smaller area:-</p>  <p>Commuters<br /> Drummond Place workers<br /> Turks Head customers<br /> St Margarets shoppers<br /> "Phelps" new wine bar customers<br /> Second cars from the existing CPZ</p>  <p>It is the worst posible outcome.Putting a positive slant on this recommendation I can only hope that the council&#39;s policy is " make it impossible for them to park &amp; then ask again in 6 months". Putting a negative slant one can only question whether "representations" have been made by certain bodies who are not resident in the area but use Hill View Road as the only available parking left in the area.</p>  <p>Speaking for Cole Park View I know that the Councils&#39;  figures are inaccurate.</p>  <p>The only solution is all or nothing and I ask you to pass on my comments to your colleagues. At its best this recommendation can only be regarded as eccentric.</p>  <p>I can assure you that this one will run &amp; run.</p>  <p>Stephen Alexander</p>  <p>I feel that this recommendation will satisfy only 2 roads in our area &amp; will annoy anyone who voted in favour or against.</p>

    <p>This devisive scenario is a result of the disasterous Lib Dem policy change in 2006 which enabled them to cherry pick roads for a cpz in order to put the squeeze on adjacent roads and conduct consultations without definitive parameters.  Due to demographics in the area there is a natural overspill of cars into adjacent streets.  I put it to the council that consultations be conducted using natural boundaries using trunk roads, railways and park boundaries be used and that the overall majority should prevail.  Alas I got the usual dismissive response: the oft repeated vacuous mantra of &#39;giving people what they wanted&#39;.  In effect 34 people (the yes vote in these 2 roads) will determine the daily lives of 900 households as well as local shops and business.  In the current economic climate this could well mean the final nail in the coffin for many of them.<br /> It is interesting in light of todays news that David Davis has made a stand against individual freedom, over-regulation and being spied upon that Nick Clegg (leader of Lib Dems) has decided that his party will not stand against him.  Perhaps RBC should take note.</p>

    <p>I note that the link in your heading goes to Appendix A instead of Appendix B, which is <a href="http://cabnet.richmond.gov.uk/Published/C00000174/M00001887/AI00016164/1039RTCG180608NPGeneralAnalysisAppBFinal.pdf">cabnet.richmond.gov.uk/Published/C00000174/M00001887/AI00016164/1039RTCG180608NPGeneralAnalysisAppBFinal.pdf</a></p>

    <p>As I wrote on 11th January [http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2007/12/cllr_morgan_comments_on_the_cpz.html<br /> ], a devious divide-and-conquer strategy.</p>  <p>TODO: Must try to remember this taste of Liberal-un-democrcacy at the next election...</p>  <p>Ed</p>

    <p>Would that be the same Nick Clegg that recently proposed road pricing by means of a big database tracking the movement of every car in the country?</p>  <p><a href="http://www.libdemvoice.org/new-poll-do-you-support-road-pricing-2797.html">www.libdemvoice.org/new-poll-do-you-support-road-pricing-2797.html</a></p>  <p>The price of fuel already achieves pretty much the same thing without any increase in bureacracy.</p>  <p>There is an argument in there since he proposes to reduce VED and fuel tax to zero... but the words are carefully chosen,  and one is all too aware what always happens with politicians, tax and temptation when they are in power.</p>  <p>If such a system is not spying I don&#39;t know what is... the guy really doesn&#39;t have a clue does he?</p>  <p>Ed</p>

    <p>I fail to see Ed&#39;s point at all. CPZs have always been granted on a street by street basis in the past. Is there any change now?</p>

    <p>I don&#39;t think  - Stephen Alexander - that the wine bar customers will be a big factor during the Mon-Fri working-day hours that the CPZ will cover. Evenings and weekends will be the bar&#39;s peak time, when the CPZ won&#39;t operate. No need to over-egg the pudding!</p>
