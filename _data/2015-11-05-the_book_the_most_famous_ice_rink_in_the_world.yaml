    <p>Brings back fond memories of my time as a Yoof in the late 50&#39;s, early 60&#39;s, used to go at least 3 times a week, happy days indeed, it was a sad day when it closed down to make way for exclusive riverside dwellings.</p>  <p>What happened to the millions the council made on the sale that was supposed to be put aside to build another rink in the area, or did it just vanish into thin air?</p>

    <p>The council made nothing on the sale: the private owners of the rink sold the site to a developer, who sold it to another developer who shut the rink and built on it.</p>  <p>Section 106 of the Planning Act allows councils to ask for a a contribution to various funds for amenities as a condition of planning consent. This is quite usual. The money was not &#39;supposed to be put aside&#39; by anyone except the ice skaters. In fact it would have been unlawful for the Council to do that (I was told at the time) as it would have amounted to a bribe to get planning permission.</p>  <p>Instead it went into a fund for sporting facilities of all kinds and was spent on improving the athletics grounds.</p>
