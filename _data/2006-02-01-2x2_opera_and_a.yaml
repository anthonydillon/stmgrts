    <p>What a lovely idea!  Sadly my children are now grown up and left the area but would have loved to have taken part.</p>  <p>Good luck to you!</p>

    <p>How many children will take part and what sort of ages will they be? Do the children need to have any previous experience? It sounds like a great idea.</p>

    <p>Hello Ann,</p>  <p>Sorry not to have got back to you sooner:  10 children from Orleans Infants are taking part, + 25 or so from St. Stephens, 15 from Waldegrave and another 15 or so from several other secondary schools  - Orleans Park, Hampton, LEH, etc.  The children do not necessarily have to have any prior experience, but they do need to be able to sing in tune and commit to the rehearsal schedule.  All parts had been allocated by the date of your email, recruited largely through schools directly but parts were also offered to those who expressed an interest from our 2 sittings in Crown Road in September and again in December.  If you&#39;d like to be kept informed of future productions - if we decided to do another one after this - please drop me your email address via the link in article.</p>
