    <p>I am and aways been a in awe of jets talents, I grew up in the same area as jet, born in the same hospital even went to the same schools. When I started work I even saw jet calling in the shop to see his mate jeff wickens sax player.jet inspired me to play guitar and for my money he remains the best.</p>
