    <p>Gill, you took the Propoganda Holiday Package so why were you shocked. You usually get what the brochure says. It was not a balanced assessment by any means.</p>  <p>I wonder whether you got a chance to watch any PA TV while you were there? And seen the shameless promotion of shahada - death for "Allah". Statistics show that a stagering 80 percent of young Palestinians living int he territories desire to die in an act of suicide-murder. And these kids do use check points. Of course they do, by your own admission they cann&#39;t get out otherwise.</p>  <p>You should talk to an IDF spokesman by the name of Rutland and get some statistics on just how many "terrorists" are apprehended at check points on a dailly basis. Before Gaza disengagement the figure was something like 1 every 20 minutes. This is the real barrier to peace; the indoctrination of generations of Palestinians to desire death. Check out PA TV on <a href="http://www.pmw.org.il">www.pmw.org.il</a> - now that&#39;s a shocker. This is what the UN should be tackling, but sometimes I get the impression that the UN is more interested in demonizing Israel, than really trying to find peace.</p>

    <p>Vicki, under international law, the Palestynians have an absolute right to fight the occupiers, just like Poles and French had a right to form resistance movements. Stop the occupation, accept the international law.</p>  <p>Eva</p>

    <p>Vicki, I monitor checkpoints in a group of 400 Israeli women (<a href="http://www.machsomwatch.org">www.machsomwatch.org</a>). I&#39;ve more than once seen the same Palestinian mentally handicapped kid come through with a suitcase which has been detonated by an army robot in a nearby field..at a checkpoint where it&#39;s easy to walk round it through hills, so I don&#39;t believe it was a real bomb. And I question who paid him the ten shekels/pound he was paid to go with it through the cp? Maybe the people interested in bumping up statistics to keep the cps? While Olmert promises Abbas that he&#39;ll relax cps, the IDF in the past month created 20+ more! (I&#39;ve also twice seen a bus explode, one I almost got on, so I understand something about that, too.) And I question YOUR statistics because they have no basis in reality; those of us already at peace with Palestinians live and work with them regularly. Fact is, all except 14 of the over 500 checkpoints and barriers are between Palestinian villages in the West Bank, nowhere near Israel. While Israeli settlements expand hugely (nearly half a million Israelis living in Palestinian occupied territory, expanding at 5%+ p.a., on 40% privately owned Palestinian land - an army statistic), the checkpoints are more about keeping Palestinians pinned down in their villages than stopping bombs. The absence of suicide attacks for the past few years is because Hamas is in a truce. When they end it, we&#39;ll see how much the checkpoints and wall help!  Tunnels?  Rockets? Get my point?  Only solution is peace. REAL security cannot be military. Even the army and politicians agree. But they aren&#39;t serious about getting out of occupied territory. Yet.</p>

    <p>Angela- Hamas is not in a truce, don&#39;t you remember when they said the truce was over a long time ago amidst fighting in Gaza? And certainly you remember Hamas calling for a truce-but not getting it- just in the past month or two so obviously there is no truce now. Why would the Israelis have cps just to keep Palestinians tied down to their villages? What&#39;s in it for Israel? Don&#39;t they want to capture terrorists or at least intercept the transfer of weapons to neighboring towns with them?</p>

    <p>Gil, You took the propaganda highway alright, as only those who live in the US know.  When you traveled to the West Bank, you saw for yourself as I did,  and with 7 others of the Michigan Peace Team Spring 2005, the truth and what is not reported in the news media in the United States.</p>  <p>I witnessed loving families, caring Palestinians, children who gathered around us counting in English 1-10, and joining us as we counted in Arabic.</p>  <p>I witnessed the percussion bombs, tear gas and shooting of Palestinian children in Bili&#39;n during their march against the apartheid wall.</p>  <p>I experienced one of my expensive cameras hit and destroyed by an Israeli bullet while in my hand during one of the weekly Bilin protest marches against the apartheid wall.</p>  <p>I witnessed a paraplegic and 3 year old and their family bombed by the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) in their march through the town of Bilin. I captured this on camera.  The IDF/IOF proceeded further into the heart of town and threw the same percussion bombs into the town&#39;s mosque.  This shooting and bombing went on for at least 1-2 hours.</p>  <p>I witnessed Israeli activists marching in Bilin, then handcuffed and dragged from the town as a result of their commitment to justice.</p>  <p>I witnessed settlers invading the sheep herders&#39; homes with their AK-47s strapped around their backs on their routine Sabbath walks to intimidate the people of Qawasis, a small hamlet of Palestinian herders who live in caves and tents in Southern Hebron.  I have pictures of these confrontations also.</p>  <p>I attended a Governor&#39;s conference in Hebron and video taped the results of an International study that concluded the Israeli settlers poisoned 70-100 Palestinian sheep using a powerful poison pellet banned by International law and only held by the Israeli army.</p>  <p>I witnessed the attempted collective punishment used by the Israeli Occupation Forces to pick up the younger brothers of one of the protesters at the Bilin weekly march.</p>  <p>I visited the Balata refugee camp, met some businessmen who want very much to provide a greater venue for their customers, but are blocked by the IDF checkpoints.</p>  <p>I witnessed my friend being detained at one of the checkpoints because he wore a Palestinian wrist band.</p>  <p>I witnessed a young Palestinian woman with 3 young children being evicted from a bus at one of the checkpoints which was located in the middle of nowhere (5-10 miles from nearest town).  Her husband lived in Jerusalem, but she was denied entry due to errant papers.  She was left alone with her children but the driver gave her his phone so she called for some assistance.  I dont know what happened to her or her young children ages 6, 4, 1.5 is my guess.  I took pictures of that incident also.</p>  <p>There are many more stories of the sadness I feel for the injustices occuring in Palestine and its people, but the people I met remained amazingly resilient.  They want peace with justice.</p>  <p>My sincere appreciation for your report, Gil.  If only America knew what we have found out first hand.</p>  <p>I am Jon Heffelfinger, a Univeristy of Michigan graduate and former UM football player. Cant say there was ever a more foreboding challenge in my life than to pursue peace with justice.  Presently I am a retired teacher of 34+ years and now a photographer and videographer.  I am also a husband and father of 3 beautiful children (now adults) and 1 grandchild, and a stepson to my 94 year old father-in-law..  I want my children and grandchildren to live in a world of peace and shared properity.  I love all people of the world, regardless of race, religion or color.  We are one and that is my intention, to be one people of the world living in peace, and there can be no peace without justice, and no justice without forgiveness.</p>

    <p>For any one interested to understand more about the historical perspective on this issue an excellent book is The Lemon Tree by Sandy Tolan. It is a very clear account which seems to try v. hard to be unbiased.</p>

    <p>Also read "Dark Hope" by David Shulman, a leading Israeli academic who spent four years in the South Hebron hills documenting the appalling treatment meted out to Palestinians by settlers and the IDF, including the sheep poisoning incident mentioned by John Heffelfinger. If you think I have swallowed propaganda, maybe you will believe him. You can also see films of settlers in Hebron attacking Palestinians and invading their property on YouTube. And you can read reports by well-respected Israeli groups such as B&#39;Tselem which document the kind of thing I witnessed. The Israeli authorities have even been known to acknowledge it themselves. A report by the Israeli Defence Force&#39;s civil administration in 2003 catalogued a series of break-ins, damage and seizure of Palestinian property by Hebron&#39;s Jewish settlers as they "consistently and systematically" worked to "establish and expand" their colony. The report also said that the activities of the settlers were as "if carried out under the protection of the Israeli regime" because no settlers are ever arrested for these crimes. It added:"The State of Israel looks very bad with regard to the rule of law in Hebron." If Britain was occupied, would we not resist? If France, Belgium, Holland were still occupied following the war, would we not support and applaud any resistance movement they managed to muster? Why are Palestinians alone expected to be completely supine in the face of such oppression while their homes are demolished around them and their children injured or killed? Meanwhile, in Hebron since I left: a child was shot dead by an Israeli soldier during protests against the mass killing of civilians - including about 25 children - in Gaza. A woman gave birth at a checkpoint in the early hours of a freezing January night after soldiers refused to let her pass through for half an hour to get to hospital. Who needs propaganda? The facts speak for themselves. Gill Swain</p>
