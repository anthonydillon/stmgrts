    <p>What a lovely article!  As a resident of one of the "humble middle-class houses" who still greatly appreciates our little river, it was a delightful read.  Thank you</p>  <p>Allison Drew</p>

    <p>Really love these articles. Could you tell me where the elf (pictured at the end) is to be found on the River Crane? I&#39;ve surveyed most of its length, but never seen this gentleman? Thanks, James</p>

    <p>Heathrow pollution? I was out on the Crane yesterday and saw plenty of wildlife  - kingfishers and herons and swarms of minnows in the water. I&#39;m no expert but it all looked pretty good to me...well, apart from Japanese Knotweed, an invasive and destructive plant that nobody wants! The Elf? Going downstream he sits on the left hand bank about 50 yards after the Talbot Road bridge. He&#39;s quite a big fellow so you shouldn&#39;t miss him.</p>

    <p>Is the Crane still navigable by shallow craft eg a canoe?</p>

    <p>Ho Ho. Thank you Martyn. My bathing suit is definitely not chic and I don&#39;t even own a bathing cap, gay or otherwise, but it&#39;s still lovely to read that people have been enjoying the river for generations. You&#39;re right about the wildlife and I guess if there are kingfishers and herons, there must be fish - but nothing like as many (or as large) as ten years ago, though they are slowly returning.</p>

    <p>You can navigate the Crane at high tide in small boats, canoes and the like. Enter the river by Thistleworth Marina and then travel inland for about 1km. You can also join the river from the slipway at the bottom of Percy Road, Isleworth - where the old Boat Building Yard used to be. You won&#39;t see any City typists swimming in chic bathing suits but it will be a real &#39;African Queen&#39; adventure.</p>

    <p>Hi Martyn, still cannot find that elf on the Crane. Spent an hour this morning searching. Could you provide a few more details. Do you need access to private gardens to find him? There seems to be no access to the Crane between Talbot Road &amp; Percy Road. Best, James</p>
