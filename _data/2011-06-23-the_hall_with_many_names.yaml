    <p>When I was attending St Stephens from 1953-57 the hall was used as our school assembly each morning, Informed by a local people back in the early sixties who remembered the original church hall stood right where the St Margarets roundabout is now, They also said there was little stream they jumped across as children that flowed down into the crane river where Sidney road runs today and not to be confused with the stream that flows around the back of Cole Park Gardens.</p>
