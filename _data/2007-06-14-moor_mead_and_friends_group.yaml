    <p>I thought that the general consensus at the Winchester Hall was against yet another coffee shop, particularly on Moormead where parking is already very difficult. If we must have one imposed ( no doubt so that a rent can be charged to the licensee) it makes  a CPZ even more necessary. Try to picture the school-run 4&#215;4s and MPVs attempting to park in the last remaining space.</p>

    <p>I would be in favour of a coffee shop.  One of the things that makes Marble Hill so vibrant is the cafe by the playground.</p>  <p>It would be great to see more people using the park, and a cafe would be a great draw, especially if it were run by a local "name" such as Zoran.</p>  <p>And for those of us gasping for a coffee at Saturday morning football, a complete must</p>  <p>Hopefully anyone using the cafe would have walked there in the first place...</p>

    <p>Now the fair is over and the long summer holiday is upon us I hope the pavilion work is carried out quickly. If Zoran is to stand a fair chance of testing the viability of the enterprise, the next six weeks will be crucial. Light refreshments and toilet facilities will make the playground and the park as a whole even more attractive to local families, dog walkers, etc. It&#39;s great to see such a valuable community resource as Moormead Park well-used, as it was last Saturday for the fair, and anything that encourages more people to come and enjoy it can surely only be a good thing.</p>
