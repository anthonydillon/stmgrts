    <p>We have noticed that we haven&#39;t had any of the gigantic lorries recently and obviously the smaller they are the better.</p>  <p>But has anyone, including Tesco, realised that in the travel plan for the proposed wine bar they mention using the loading bay for corporate coaches?</p>

    <p>Why shouldn&#39;t the wine bar use the loading bay - Tesco do not own the highway, and therefore cannot claim sole use, surely?</p>

    <p>There may be fewer incidents of big lorries - not living on the doorstep I don&#39;t observe the deliveries as often as those of you nearby. But how often do they take two deliveries at the same time from smaller lorries?</p>  <p>Last Sunday morning there were two trucks delivering at about 10.15, one of which was blocking the entrance/exit of Broadway Ave. I complained (with full voice projection) to the Tesco team, and someone scurried out to speak to the driver.</p>  <p>But by then the damage was done: traffic was building up on St. Margarets Rd., the tranquil sunny Sunday morning was more like a stressful Monday in the rain.</p>  <p>I took the registration of the offending truck, but wasn&#39;t sure what to do about it. Any ideas?</p>  <p>Judy</p>

    <p>Hello &#39;Scooterboy&#39;.<br /> The reasons that the wine bar shouldn&#39;t be allowed to use the Tescos bay are very simple.</p>  <p>Their application succeeded on the basis of - their claim to be a &#39;local&#39; drinking hole for &#39;local&#39; people and they would actively discourage the use of any non-public transport for those who couldn&#39;t walk there.  They have claimed that corporate hospitality was not their prime aim, and the transport officers specifically wrote in their report that &#39;they would not like to see coach parties&#39;.  To this end the Planning Committee asked the applicants to submit a transport plan for their approval.<br /> Perhaps &#39;Scooterboy&#39; and others might like to note that ten days after the traffic plan appeared on the council&#39;s website, it was changed on the website without re-informing any interested parties.  It then included a request to use the delivery bay for coach parties.</p>  <p>So Tesco lorries by day Coaches by night?</p>

    <p>I work for Tesco, as a stock control manager in central London and we manage to cut off a road into zone 1 every single morning when we get our morning delivery of fresh foods. The abuse I get unloading the delivery whilst trying to fill up my shop from people in cars and scooters is a nightmare! I understand that it doesn;t help the traffic, but if the council don&#39;t want to help it there&#39;s nothing we can do... and the lorries get a parking ticket the moment they park! go figure.</p>

    <p>Seems to me that it is not individual managers or staff that are to blame for the problems. Personally I have found our local St Margarets Manager and staff very polite and helpful.</p>

    <p>There it is then, in black and white.  You all only have yourselves to blame.  If you didn&#39;t shop at Tesco, there wouldn&#39;t be any spikes in demand,  and the huge lorries wouldn&#39;t be needed.  Problem solved.</p>  <p>Try Waitrose in Twickenham or Richmond instead.  The food is of vastly superior quality.</p>

    <p>I agree with Anonymous Coward and even though I live only 2 minutes walk from Tesco Express I prefer walking the 15 minutes to Waitrose in Twickenham. As you said the food is so much better at Waitrose and at least there is space to move the pushchair around!<br /> It is such a pity that people complain about the delivery lorries but still carry on shopping there every day.</p>

    <p>When I say I have found them polite and helpful I mean in dealing with complaints about noise, rubbish etc.</p>

    <p>I agree with Jane, the staff at tesco are extreamly helpfull and very friendly. The Manager does an excellant job maintaining the store and trying his best to keep the outside tidy, although it is not actually him who litters outside and refuses to use the two litter bins provided! It is also not the Managers fault Tesco decide to use such enormous lorries to deliver to more than one store.</p>
