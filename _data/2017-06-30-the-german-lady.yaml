    <p>Hi Martyn, Thanks for this. This is a story that I&#39;ve heard a couple of times previously, but always rather vaguely. It&#39;s great to see a first-hand account, I hope you don&#39;t mind, but I&#39;ve copied it wholesale (with suitable attributions) to Harringay Online. Any more Harringay memories?</p>
