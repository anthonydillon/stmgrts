    <p>Thanks for this. One error: Louis Phillippe, Duc d&#39;Orleans, was the &#39;future king&#39; when he lived in Twickenham; he also lived at Orleans House [1815-17]. He became &#39;King of the French&#39; after the July Revolution of 1830 and reigned until he was forced to abdicate in 1848. He returned to England and lived in Claremont, an 18th-century Palladian mansion near Esher until his death in1850. [wikipedia]</p>
