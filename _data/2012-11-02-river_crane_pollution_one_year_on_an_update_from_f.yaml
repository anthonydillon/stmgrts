    <p>Many thanks for the update.  The quality of reporting on this issue is impressive.</p>  <p>As a young boy, I lived near the River Crane and witnessed a number of pollution incidents.  Back then there was no one fighting for the river and it was left to its own devices. Now it has many  friends who are fighting for its recovery.</p>  <p>Regards,</p>  <p>Colin B.</p>

    <p>Thanks for posting this FORCE report on the pollution.  Colin B is right in saying the Crane now has lots of Friends - 469 at the last count - and we encourage everyone with an interest in the Crane valley to join them as a member of FORCE.  The more members we have the more influence we have with local landowners, politicians and others.  Check us out on the web-site, <a href="http://www.force.org.uk">www.force.org.uk,</a>, and come and find us at our monthly volunteer days - all visitors and volunteers very welcome!</p>  <p>Rob Gray Chair of FORCE</p>

    <p><em>Seeking witnesses for prosecution.</em></p>  <p>If you fished the Crane before the 2011 pollution incident, or have any pictures of fish, other wildlife or particularly pleasant parts of the river, or witnessed the state of the river immediately before, during or after the incident, we&#39;d like to hear from you.  Please contact FORCE as above or the Thames Anglers&#39; Conservancy at  <a href="mailto:%61%64%6D%69%6E%40%72%69%76%65%72%74%61%63%2E%6F%72%67">admin@rivertac.org</a></p>  <p>Thanks</p>  <p>Ed Randall, TAC secretary.</p>
