    <p>I&#39;m confused. The cards are free. So what is the free trial? What registration is required?</p>

    <p>I think the cards were free to anyone during the trial, I assume it was a success and therefore to continue to make use of one you have to register with the council to prove you live in the borough, just like you do for your parking permit.</p>  <p>If you have a parking permit you can do it on line because they have all your details already, I did and got it through in a week.</p>  <p>I have used it a couple of times when picking up large items, found it very handy, it&#39;s not really FREE because you are already paying through the nose to park down your own road!!!</p>

    <p>I am confused too as I dont know, being a pensioner, if my card was on free trial.  All I know is that I started using it and then had to put some money in.  Suddenly the machine was saying &#39;card empty&#39; I paid another &pound;20 and the machine still said &#39;card empty&#39;  Three other people tried for me but still the same thing.  Confirmation of the payment  said I now had &pound;40 in my account but still the machine says &#39;card empty&#39;  When I phoned for help I was told it was me not doing the right thing and so in desperation I have taken the card into the Civic Centre and am waiting to hear from the Council.  Anyone else had this problem, and if so, how do I get reimbursed?</p>

    <p>I am also a pensioner. However I applied for a card, putting some money into it online, and have used it many times now without any problems. It sounds to me as if Mac&#39;s card is faulty and he needs a replacement.</p>  <p>The free cards are a time limited trial to get residents to try the system out.

    <p>I have just learned how to distinguish the trial card from a proper card by reading the latest news on the richmond home page</p>  <p>The trial card is white</p>
