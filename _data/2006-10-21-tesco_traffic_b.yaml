    <p>Why oh why has the council not acted to resolve this major problem. Is it going to take a serious accident or god forbid, a death before the council take action ?</p>

    <p>Why this hysteria with regards to Tesco&#39;s Deliveries, the bus driver is trained to deal with situations like this, that&#39;s why the ambulance got by, If you were to do a proper survey over at least 14 hours each day from 07:00hrs to 21:00hrs I think you will find more 4&#215;4&#39;s, Builders vans &amp; private cars obstructing this area of the St Margarets Road than delivery drivers, don&#39;t forget Tesco&#39;s are not the only shop that have deliveries, lets not just single them out, I think you will find that it is a Parking problem that is repeated in virtualy ever town in the UK.</p>

    <p>I saw a accident last week outside Tesco.  This was not caused by the van that was unloading at the time but by the parent of the child who could not be bothered to cross at the traffic lights.</p>
