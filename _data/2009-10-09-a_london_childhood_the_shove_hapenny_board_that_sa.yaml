    <p>A fellow survivor! I remember that alley that linked the streets to Turnpike Lane. It was - and still is - known as "The Passages" and when I was older I would walk down there to the Co-op on the corner, rationbook in my hand and my mother&#39;s &#39;divi&#39; number in my memory. 60 years on I can still remember that 6 digit number.</p>

    <p>To Doug Winter, you mentioned Stanley Farrant, did you know he moved to Southend on Sea with his parents, but was killed by a man who tried to gatecrash his step daughters birthday party, he died a year and a day and 4 hours after the attack, so the attacker got away with murder, or so we thought</p>

    <p>Hi Martyn, I run another neighbourhood website, Harringay Online. One of our members came across your story and photo. I&#39;d very much like to add them both to our Harringay history section. Could you let me know if you&#39;re comfortable with that? ( <a href="mailto:%68%75%67%68%40%68%61%72%72%69%6E%67%61%79%6F%6E%6C%69%6E%65%2E%63%6F%6D">hugh@harringayonline.com</a>).</p>  <p>You&#39;re welcome to join the site and look at our archive of old photos and stories from the Harringay diaspora. We have members from Australia, North America, Europe and some great stories including one from a member recounting his Wightman Road childhood in the 1920&#39;s. We&#39;re hungry for more!</p>
