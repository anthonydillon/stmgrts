    <p>I grew up on Sydney Road in the 1970&#39;s and remember talking to my neighbour, Mrs Ena Webb, about the V2 rocket attack in the late 1980s. She told me that she was buried up to her neck with the remains of the milkman&#39;s horse a few inches from her face for what seemed like hours. I also recall her saying that a one-armed WW1 veteran was one of those killed as he brought a breakfast tray down the stairs from his poorly wife. Apparently he was caught by flying glass from the fanlight above his front door though how she came by this information is a bit puzzling. According to her this gentleman lived on the south side of the street towards Haringey Passage around number 54. I can&#39;t recall Mrs Web&#39;s House number but she was on he north side of the road about 10 houses to the left of the post-war Sheridan Court building.</p>
