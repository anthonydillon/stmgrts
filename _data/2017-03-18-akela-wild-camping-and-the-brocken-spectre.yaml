    <p>A farmer&#39;s son writes:</p>  <p>- The countryside is surprisingly deserted most of the time when it&#39;s not being cultivated. However a figure moving in a landscape may be noticed from afar which may bring a local speeding out on a mini-tractor to find out what your game is.</p>  <p>- Dogs may be shot on sight but humans can expect nothing worse than a firm request to leave - which is harmless. Be polite even if provoked and you&#39;ll be OK.</p>  <p>- Bury your waste. Don&#39;t trample growing crops. Hay is a crop. Say hullo to anyone you do meet.</p>  <p>- Bullocks are harmless but curious and frisky; bulls may be dangerous. Learn to tell the difference.</p>  <p>- If after dark you spot a bright light shining towards you, don&#39;t look at but keep your head down. It may be the local lads out &#39;lamping&#39; for foxes: if they see a gleam of white reflecting the lamp they will shoot at it, taking it for a fox eye. They shoot each other this way from time to time.</p>  <p>In Scotland wild campers are called &#39;gangrels&#39; - it is recognised that this is a normal thing for young males to do and tolerated. In lowland England it&#39;s rare and in many parts unknown.</p>  <p>As Gerard Winstanley, the first Digger, wrote: &#39;The Lord made the Earth to be a Common Treasury for All&#39;: enjoy!</p>
