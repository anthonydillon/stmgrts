    <p>It is not the Goverment that is being affect the most.  It is working parents that it effect.  We have to either take a unpaid leave date or use one of our little entitlement that we have.</p>  <p>It also has a big effect on the kids.  Kids should be a priority and should be protect from all of this.</p>  <p>The Pensions applys to all no matter what sector of industry you are in.  You want to be lucky that you are in more of a secure job than private sector employees are in.</p>  <p>Count yourself lucky and stop effecting all other hard working people.</p>

    <p>I value teachers but they dont realise how lucky they are and that taxpayers are funding them.</p>  <p>They work only half the year and get all the school holidays off but get paid ALL 52 weeks of the year.</p>  <p>They get paid much more than workers in the private sector</p>  <p>They have jobs for life as it is almost impossible to sack an underperforming teacher.</p>  <p>They have goldplated fat cat pensions worth between half a million to 1.5million pounds which is paid for by people like us paying tax who will get no pension.</p>  <p>They get 6 months full paid sick leave whenever they want it.</p>  <p>It is time for their nice little gravy train to end as it has for all of us normal working people</p>
