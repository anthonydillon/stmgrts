    <p>I have lived in the area for 35 yearsand the park is the pkace where I go to enjoy the peace and tranquility throughout the year. This is the second time that English Heritage has attempted to impose their plans on a park which is a vital community space whose unspoiled beauty is enjoyed by people who both live in the area and who come for the peace.  I would rather.  pay to use the park than have it destroyed by these commercial proposals.</p>

    <p>This is a beautiful House and parkland. It has been the heart of St Margarets all my life and I would hate to see it destroyed by the proposals planned by English Heritage. I urge Richmond Council to reject the plan and ask for a more modest application.</p>

    <p>Some of these criticisms seem valid. The 347 trees, though, is misleading. English Heritage&#39;s plans need to be properly examined, but people need to understand what they are trying to achieve, even if we end up disagreeing with them. I&#39;ve tried to set out some of the issues at <a href="http://thewhiterajah.blogspot.co.uk/2017/10/living-with-history.html">thewhiterajah.blogspot.co.uk/2017/10/living-with-history.html</a></p>  <p>We do need to discuss this in the community as the planning process doesn&#39;t seem to be working in a way that is likely to produce results that anyone is happy with.</p>

    <p>The planning application has been at: <a href="http://www2.richmond.gov.uk/lbrplanning/Planning_CASENO.aspx?strCASENO=17%2F1094%2FFUL&amp;DocTypeID=51%23docs">www2.richmond.gov.uk/lbrplanning/Planning_CASENO.aspx?strCASENO=17/1094/FUL&amp;DocTypeID=51#docs</a> for nearly 8 months; however it is still open for comment.</p>  <p>It has been discussed at length on Twickerati (81 comments):</p>  <p>English Heritage&#226;&#128;&#153;s Marble Hill Plans Spark&#194;&nbsp;Petition <a href="https://twickerati.wordpress.com/2017/10/18/english-heritage-marble-hill-house-park-revived/">twickerati.wordpress.com/2017/10/18/english-heritage-marble-hill-house-park-revived</a></p>  <p>I expect it to be approved and suggest that comments should address the mitigation of problems rather than simply expressing dislike. The main opposition comes from the residents of Montpelier Row who fear disturbance by the new caf&Atilde;&copy;/restaurant and, as usual, other nearby residents concerned about parking.</p>  <p>The proposal is well set out at: <a href="http://www.marblehillsociety.org.uk/pages/2017/marble_hill_revived.shtml">www.marblehillsociety.org.uk/pages/2017/marble_hill_revived.shtml</a> except for one thing:  the dog-free children&#226;&#128;&#153;s play area has been excluded from the application; residents who value this area should therefore object to it.</p>  <p>My own view tis that the refurbished property will not attract huge numbers of extra visitors except for special events, so limiting the number and length of such events should be the aim.</p>
