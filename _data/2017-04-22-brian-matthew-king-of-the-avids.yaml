    <p>Brian Matthew presided over the sound of Saturday mornings in our house, when he got all kinds of household names to play live in the Saturday Club studio. Yet it was in his TV incarnation with Thank Your Lucky Stars that I have my strongest memory.  Introducing The Beatles as "the most dynamic group since the Shadows" was an understatement even to my 12 year old ears. More recently a long bath listening to Sounds of the Sixties was a relaxing preparation for a week-end dominated by young children. See you on side 2 mate</p>
