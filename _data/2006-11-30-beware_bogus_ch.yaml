    <p>Europe Suppliers Ltd (54014277) are also currently opperating in the Bexley, Kent area.<br /> If you receive one of their leaflets call Bexley trading standards on 020 8308 7627.<br /> Also you could leave out a bag of mouldy, rotting household waste with their leaflet attached. That&#39;s what i plan to do on their next collection day!</p>

    <p>I&#39;m told it costs charities a lot of money to dispose of good they receive which they can&#39;t sell. Some of the old clothes I need to dispose of are probably not good enough to sell in local charity shops. However they aren&#39;t quite bad enough to throw out of for the local council to collect with the fabric scrap. For example I have a skirt with a broken zip which I don&#39;t want any more. So I think maybe it&#39;s better to give such things to A&amp;P Collections or similar than any of the alternatives. If someone malkes a living out of it is that such a bad thing? Some of the staff working in charity shops are paid.</p>

Needless to say we carried all the stuff back within seconds.<br /> We are from South Africa and know there are thousand of poor people in need who need these clothes, isn&#39;t this a form of fraud?

    <p>This sham charity A&amp;P have this week issued mailouts in the Hammersmith &amp; Fulham area. In this instance they have chosen or been informed that this is a most opportune time as the properties within the entire building are currently undergoing a refurb, which requires most cupboards to be emptied of all contents therefore rediscovering all manner of forgotten, unused and unwanted goods.They are scheduled to collect tomorrow, having read that they do not aid the needy I shall fill a bag with all the lost socks, old knickers, lost earrings, old blankets and unwanted freebie mag-bags that I&#39;ve been collecting for reasons unknown over the years. And if they are able to make money out of that lot of  old tat - then I say &#39;Good Luck&#39; to them!</p>

    <p>Hey, I&#39;ve just had a leaflet put through my door (south yorkshire) from europe supplies ltd.</p>  <p>I have spoken to the man who gave me the leaflet. He is a refugee from eastern europe. Is it really such a "horrible crime" and "massive scam" that these people who have next to money money, will go and sell these clothes to people in poor countries who can&#39;t afford to shop at the sort of shops we can, and to make a bit of money for them selves???????</p>  <p>When clothes are given to charity shops, they too are also sold on aren&#39;t they?!?!?! I wonder if the clothes given to charity shops ever actually reach poor people... Fair enough the money they make goes back into the charity, however I would rather my clothes go to the people who are collecting them from my house tomorrow morning. The money they make from it will surely help them too...</p>  <p>My next door neighbour alerted me to this "scam" telling me "you do know that the clothes don&#39;t go to poor countries, they keep them them selves!!" And I thought to myself, how ignorant are you?!?! If the man coming tomorrow is so poor that he has to masquarade as a con artist to get clothes, then I feel even more strongly about digging through my old stuff to find anything at all that I can give.</p>  <p>You need to all wake up and just think about why these people may be doing this. There are two sides to every story.</p>

    <p>Got a leaflet from A&amp;P collection in the Balham area. They are collecting this Tuesday 27/01. There leaflet came through a few days after a legitimate charity is collecting on the Wednesday. I suspect that what they do, is check where legitimate charities are collecting and collect a day or two earlier. They are working on the assumption that people may confuse the days or put it out a day or two earlier.</p>

    <p>Helping Arms sent through a blue bag through the letter box today in Salisbury, Wiltshire collecting clothes etc.  Checked them out, note using different company number - 5583979, not charity and if you look at companies house very strange company history.  Going to chuck bag away, keep an eye out in case the neighbours put them out.</p>

    <p>We are in Durrington, Worthing.<br /> Had a &#39;Helping Arms&#39; blue bag through the door yesterday and started to fill it up this morning as they are going to collect tomorrow. Decided to look them up as I realised they weren&#39;t a charity from the wording on the bag.<br /> Looking into it trading standards have asked them to change the use of the word charity back in July 07.<br /> If you read the wording underneath the boldy typed thank you, you can see that they have written about the fact the items will be sold on to african / eastern european countries as affordable items and then also something about the fact that they provide jobs for people in those countries sorting the clothes and for people over here sorting, transporting &amp; collecting them.<br /> I dont mind the fact that their being sold on cheaply as I dont think our local shops would accept them - to good to throw but not good enough to sell here iykwim? It just makes me worry that if they are profiting from this are they just throwing away donations like mine? Think I might take it all up to the salvation army bank but now I feel guilty just in case they are legitimate - annoying as I cant search them on companies house as its a sunday.... dont think I&#39;ll give them the benefit of the doubt though until they do get charity status that they were applying for in 2007.</p>

    <p>Received a Helping Arms, blue bag tonight in Andover Hants. (Fri</p>  <p>Just from the bag, I thought something was a bit suspicious, they were asking for too many things.</p>  <p>Usually charities just want clothing, shoes, and blankets, maybe ornaments, but these wanted  all clothing, blankets, shoes, toiletries, perfume.</p>  <p>I also had never heard of them before, and always willingly fill a bag for known charities, like Great Ormond Street, or PDSA etc.</p>  <p>Had a google, and came across info that confirmed my beliefs, they were dodgy, and the only people that were to gain, would be the "Helping Arms"  more like "Helping themselves"</p>  <p>Don`t want to see people being misled into thinking they are doing good, when all the time they`re being conned.</p>

    <p>Does EMMA GREEN above actually work for one of these organisations? Consider some of her points:</p>  <p>How can you "masquerade" as a con artist? And, if you are genuine then surely you should ask and explain what you want, why and what you are going to do with it.<br /> So the clothes are going to be sold on to those who can&#39;t afford them otherwise? And are they in desperate need of perfume? Cosmetics? Toiletries? Are these poor people really interested in handbags, curtains, toys, belts?</p>  <p>I can think that, as well as being wary of the companies themselves, one should wonder about those who try to justify their operations..</p>  <p>Oh, and "Helping Arms" are in Stevenage: January.</p>  <p>Incidentally, how did these refugees from Eastern Europe get here?</p>

    <p>Just had a leaflet through the door from Helping Arms - in Fareham, Hampshire. The grammar on the leaflet made me a bit suspicious so I looked them up. Glad I did! I think I left clothes and stuff out for them before, but never again. I&#39;m not giving them my stuff so they can make a profit through dishonesty.  Just wish I&#39;d caught the person putting it through me door though! I&#39;m taking it down the charity shop from now on.  Or maybe I&#39;ll leave them something unpleasant in the bag instead...</p>

    <p>Did you know, that all business companies work on behalf of the charity, charity get only chips after collected rag bags are sold by their partners. If you donate directly it doesn&#39;t mean that is the best way to help your favorite charity, because they need to have sorted items in their shops. If you have any unwanted clothing and other things just give them away to anyone and be happy that people from other countries are poor and they will reuse nearly everything. Charity is an illusion in uk and this world, thieves and profit seekers are behind all charity organizations.</p>

    <p>Europe Suppliers 5401427 have been struck off companies house and are no longer a trading company. So what they are doing is illegal. They are not allowed to trade with a struck off company, if you see the van(take down van reg and report), report to Inland Revenue/Customs &amp; Excise etc. The were operating from a house in at: 64 MOSTYN AVENUE Wembley, according to company&#39;s house. They are operating in Hillindon, London this Easter. If you see them, report them and if you do leave a bag, make sure its full of household waste.</p>

    <p>1-800 charity cars is a car donation scam. Feeling the Christmas spirit in 2008, I decided to donate my 1993 custom hightop conversion van. I called 1-800 charity cars and told them of my wish to donate my van. I told them the only problem with it was the water pump was starting to leak, other than that the van was great. My van had all the wood, 1 year old paint job, running boards, new goodyear tires, new alloy wheels, working color TV, DVD and Video player, CD player, remote start, ice cold R34 AC, tow package, 1 year old rebuilt front end etc. They gave me $500 for tax write off and said that it sold for less than that brian Menzies is a liar and a car donation scam artist. I emailed him with KBB/NADA valuations showing their value as closer to what I could have sold it for. This organization is a scam and a rip off. brian Menzies is a liar and a crook. charity scam, car donation scam</p>

    <p>&#39;Helping Arms&#39;in Swindon - co-incidentally they are calling for donations on the same day as three other charities have left bags to be collected - I googled the company no. and they are bogus alerted the local press who passed me onto Office of Fair Trading:  all these charities only hire white vans so I would have to watch to ensure the correct charity was collecting their bag and not the bogus co. collecting them all from peoples doorstep - so angry that nothing forceful and lawful can stop such crooks stealing donations intended to raise funds for charity.</p>

    <p>My goodness Helping Arms get about don&#39;t they? They are in Stevenage and collecting on Saturday. I will watch out for van and take details for local Trading Standards.All these people seem to carry on regardless though. I would not advocate as some have done to leave rubbish or glass etc in the bags;if children are used in these operations they would be harmed and the rubbish will be dumped anyway causing nuisance to others. I suspect these are not individual &#39;poor&#39; people doing this just trying to make a few pennies as some have said. The fact they are nationwide in their scope suggests organised crime to me and the money made,far from helping the poor here or abroad could be being used in other more serious criminal activities such as drugs, guns or people trafficking. They also deprive legitimate charities of much needed revenue at a difficult time in the economy. Not least it is a despicable business that exploits and cynically subverts the genuine charitable nature of the people.</p>

    <p>Hi, the last Saturday I received, through my door, a leaflet from the so called registered charity "Helping Arms". I confess to be misled at the beginning as it said it was supported by the University College London. However, I have just recently read in my local newspaper about the police warnings on bogus charities and began to have doubts. My husband suggested me to make a search by brownsing the registered number and I landed in this web page! OMG, I feel so bad to have learnt that "charity" is just a fraud. I wish I had checked it out first time I gave them a huge black sack outside my door, containing some of my child&#39;s old clothes. I sincerely thought they were genuine! Thanks for this useful information. I will pass it on to my friends. What is annoying is someone who is making up lies and misleading the public just for profits. They are collecting now, Tuesday, But they will find nothing!!</p>

    <p>Helping Arms 7119680 collecting in Ruislip this week. Am always tempted by these leaflets as I don&#39;t drive and can&#39;t get to my local charity shops when I have a clear-out but won&#39;t use them on principle. Much better to contact your local RSPCA collection centre and they&#39;ll come out to collect anything you don&#39;t want. Will be contacting my local paper as well to see if they&#39;ll do a piece on these bogus collectors.</p>

    <p>There is an informative news report from GetHampshire dated 30.10.08 at:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.gethampshire.co.uk/news/s/2038323_clothing_collections_not_for_charity">www.gethampshire.co.uk/news/s/2038323_clothing_collections_not_for_charity</a><br /> &#39; . . the Charity Commission says &#39;Helping Arms&#39; applied to register as a charity in August 2007 but was rejected in October of that year . . &#39;<br /> but it does not seem that there is any way to put them out of business. It is up to the donor to satisfy themselves that the recipient is what they say they are: &#39;caveat donor!&#39;</p>  <p>Some donors will be uncaring and simply glad to be shot of their unwanted possessions.</p>  <p>This web page has become, thanks to Google, a useful way to alert naive donors, so thanks Peter!</p>

    <p>I just received yet another leaflet from so called Third World clothing collection SHC collections Ltd ( No 06437255 ). I already felt really bad as a month ago i put out the wrong bag of clothes. After a sort out i had a bag of clothes for cllection and another bag containing halloween costumes,summer shorts and a t.shrt from christies when my partners dad died. These went out by mistake and i franticly tried to get them back but the e-mail address was bogus. I just chased a man up the street who brought this leaflet to ask for a phone No only to find he was foreign and got nowhere. I&#39;m livid now and would rather go to the charity shop or put them in the bin. I am in Burnley Lancs and get these regular.</p>

    <p>Helping arms are in Ramsgate Kent now - re Chris Astbury&#39;s comment - a quick trawl of the web shows they have been "applying for charitable status" for a long while now - not just since January - it doesn&#39;t take much to keep changing dates to keep something looking ok.</p>

    <p>SOS Clothes Ltd is collecting in St Margarets claiming to give proceeds to The Tree of Hope. The SOS Clothes charity does not check out on the charity commission website. At first glance you would think that the collection is conducted by The Tree of Hope itself but this is not the case. Read this article <a href="http://blogs.mirror.co.uk/investigations/2009/07/sos-clothes-silent-on-profit-f.html">blogs.mirror.co.uk/investigations/2009/07/sos-clothes-silent-on-profit-f.html</a> and decide for yourself. Better to take your items to a legitimate high street charity</p>

    <p>Received a leaflet from Helping Arms (no. 7119680) midday. They purport to be collecting to support &#39;University College London Hospital&#39; The cheeky blighters did not even leave a bag this time because, as they state on their leaflet (sic) &#39;to use less of plastic&#39;- how altruistic of them, but of course is not this their purpose?  Call me a cynical old bat but I don&#39;t think so.</p>

There is no mention of a specific programme or project.</p>  <p>The Government Charity Commission website has no record of W&amp;W Help.  The company registration number 6296698 on the leaflet does check out on the Companies House website.  W&amp;W Help was dissolved in March 2009.</p>  <p>Please please do not support these people by leaving your unwanted items on the doorstep.</p>

    <p>GT recycling are saying that they give &pound;100 for every TON of clothing collected!! A ton of clothing is a very large amount and &pound;100, even if given to the charity, is a pittance.</p>  <p>I think that Parliament should find time to outlaw these organisations, some based abroad.</p>

    <p>Ronald McDonald House Charities appears to be a legitimate charity. There have been incidences in other areas where people posing to represent these charities are collecting. My advice is rather than leave anything on your doorstep just take it to the charity shop. That way there is no doubt.</p>
