    <p>As a nearby resident, I fully support opening this superb house and the work of the Trust. But need to think about parking arrangements. The house is in a completely residential area. At present parking controls do not operate on Saturdays. Hopefully Trust literature will make this clear. Nearest car park I can think of is St Margarets pub - perhaps some arrangement can be made.</p>

    <p>Please do not park in the St Margarets pub car park, the Tavern operate a penalty notice system for non-customers using their car park - as Peter says the nearby parking controls do not operate at weekends in &#39;S&#39; Zone at other times there is a voucher parking system operating in many of the nearby roads. Buy vouchers from local shops. Always check the signage.<br /> Also the house is featured in the Jubilee edition of My St Margarets Magazine - out on Monday.</p>
