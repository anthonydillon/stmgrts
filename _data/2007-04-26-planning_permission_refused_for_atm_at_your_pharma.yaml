    <p>And yet they let Tescos clutter up the main road 18 hours a day with articulated lorries.</p>  <p>Laughable!</p>

    <p>Tesco have yet another monopoly - they control the cash in St. Margarets. Most of the time you can only get cash in St.Margarets from Tesco. If their machine is not working - tough.<br /> Did tesco ever get permission for their machine?<br /> Why are the local councillors so keen to please Tesco?</p>

    <p>I admit I was against a cash machine here, not least because it looked like being one which charged to take money out. I would not object to one at the Post Office, which would be a safer location and certainly not one which charged.</p>

    <p>As I understand it, the post office did apply to have an ATM and were turned down by the Council. Tesco applied to have one and were also turned down. Spot the error. Perhaps Your Pharmacy should simply follow Tesco&#39;s example...</p>

    <p>Just a reminder that, when it&#39;s open, you can get cash out at the post office as an alternative to Tesco.</p>

    <p>I think the history of the Tesco machine is they installed the existing one without planning permission, but were granted permission ex post facto. The Post Office was understandably miffed, as it had applied previously and been turned down.</p>  <p>Tesco applied for a second macine, but were turned down. It might be that if the Post Office reapplied then, with community support, it could succeed second time.</p>

    <p>I was interested by the comment in the officer&#39;s report that the landlord would not allow changes to the fascia under the lease in any event.</p>
