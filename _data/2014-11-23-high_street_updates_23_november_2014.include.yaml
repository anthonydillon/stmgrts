    <p>I noticed the second hand shop opposite the station is displaying &#39;vintage fur&#39; in the window. Just  because it&#39;s old fur, doesn&#39;t make it OK to sell it.</p>

    <p>You&#39;re sad.  Fur is a sustainable resource - unlike nylon for example.</p>

    <p>Actually EGB your the sad case here! The previous comment is correct. Fur is only sustainable if the animal is bread for purpose, kept in un-natural surroundings and imported as fur farms are banned from this country. If your morals allow you to be comfortable with this then go ahead buy the over priced item and parade around St. Marg.  By the way Nylon is not the only material these days.  You you have a very interesting wardrobe!</p>

    <p>Peter I agree but lets remember the 2<sup>nd</sup> commenter started throwing mud at someone expressing an honest opinion. Some rebuttal in defence is to be expected.</p>
