    <p>I have read elsewhere that Hotchkiss and Bettington crashed near Wolvercote Oxfordshire. I am trying to find out the background of a photo of "The Funeras of the aeroplane heros" Dated 13.9.1912.<br /> How sure are you of the location of the crash. I know of two others who died in a crash near Hitchin,<br /> Capt. Patrick Hamilton and Lt. Atholl Wyness-Stuart, a military funeral for these took place in Hitchin before there bodies were returned to their homes for burial.</p>
