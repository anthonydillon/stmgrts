    <p>Virol was great, my mother "doled it out" as a treat when my sister and I were "convalescing" from Whooping Cough or Mumps (no MMR in those days). Don&#39;t remember being given at school though. But Martyn is right that no-one seemed to have allergies. Except I do recall one - just one.  At the Christmas school party, about 1960, the teacher suddenly remembered we had a boy with Diabetes in the class and announced to the entire room (50 children + helping adults) that he couldn&#39;t have the usual cake, jelly &amp; ice-cream etc.  His solution for this mortified 9 year old?  "Find him some fruit!" Maybe we were healthier then (no multi-billion food &amp; drink industry advertising on colour telly) but teachers are now certainly better informed and more sensitive.</p>

    <p>I remember Virol especially as my parents had a pharmacy.  We didn&#39;t get it at school although we did get 1/3 pint of milk, which was never in the fridge so it was warm in the summer (eugh!) and frozen in winter (more eugh!).  Interesting history above because Beecham (who produced Horlicks) purchased Bovril, Marmite &amp; Ambrosia from Cavenham Foods.  The company was sold on again to CPC in 1990. My parents used to give us Minadex if we were recovering from colds, cough, tonsilitis etc. and Lucozade with that beautifully  orange cellophaned wrapped bottle.  Rosehip syrup was also popular in the 60s - another very sweet syrup which was good for us and we believed them - a spoonful of sugar and all that!</p>

    <p>I must have gone to the same primary school as Martyn Day in Tufnell Park, I agree we were given a spoonful of Virol every week by a woman, thought she was the nurse. We used to queue up in the corridor by class, and it cost a penny. I loved it.  You were right, we all seemed healthier then. We were also given syrup of figs to keep us regular (normally after bath time on a Friday). Also Liquid Frutta, for coughs, tasted awful.</p>

    <p>My mother told me that she put Virol on my dummy and was convinced that the sticky sweet stuff was responsible for my baby teeth dropping out or needing to be extracted!! Beware&eth;&#159;&#152;&eth;&#159;&#152;&eth;&#159;&#152;</p>

    <p>Yes, I remember those times well.  My favourites in my childhood were Virol by the spoonful, wonderful.  Also Nestle&#39;s Milk (which was a sweet sticky fluid which came in a white tin) spread on a slice of bread.  Delicious!  I also remember as a child exploring an empty house which my father had bought and finding a large unlabelled tin (probably about 2kg size) of a brown powder, which we tasted.  My sister didn&#39;t like it, but I could not get enough of it.  It turned out to be instant coffee, which I had never seen before, and must explain why these days I am addicted to espresso.....</p>
