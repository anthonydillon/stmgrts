    <p>Virol was great, my mother "doled it out" as a treat when my sister and I were "convalescing" from Whooping Cough or Mumps (no MMR in those days). Don&#39;t remember being given at school though. But Martyn is right that no-one seemed to have allergies. Except I do recall one - just one.  At the Christmas school party, about 1960, the teacher suddenly remembered we had a boy with Diabetes in the class and announced to the entire room (50 children + helping adults) that he couldn&#39;t have the usual cake, jelly &amp; ice-cream etc.  His solution for this mortified 9 year old?  "Find him some fruit!" Maybe we were healthier then (no multi-billion food &amp; drink industry advertising on colour telly) but teachers are now certainly better informed and more sensitive.</p>

    <p>I remember Virol especially as my parents had a pharmacy.  We didn&#39;t get it at school although we did get 1/3 pint of milk, which was never in the fridge so it was warm in the summer (eugh!) and frozen in winter (more eugh!).  Interesting history above because Beecham (who produced Horlicks) purchased Bovril, Marmite &amp; Ambrosia from Cavenham Foods.  The company was sold on again to CPC in 1990. My parents used to give us Minadex if we were recovering from colds, cough, tonsilitis etc. and Lucozade with that beautifully  orange cellophaned wrapped bottle.  Rosehip syrup was also popular in the 60s - another very sweet syrup which was good for us and we believed them - a spoonful of sugar and all that!</p>

    <p>I must have gone to the same primary school as Martyn Day in Tufnell Park, I agree we were given a spoonful of Virol every week by a woman, thought she was the nurse. We used to queue up in the corridor by class, and it cost a penny. I loved it.  You were right, we all seemed healthier then. We were also given syrup of figs to keep us regular (normally after bath time on a Friday). Also Liquid Frutta, for coughs, tasted awful.</p>

    <p>My mother told me that she put Virol on my dummy and was convinced that the sticky sweet stuff was responsible for my baby teeth dropping out or needing to be extracted!! Beware&eth;&#159;&#152;&eth;&#159;&#152;&eth;&#159;&#152;</p>

    <p>Yes, I remember those times well.  My favourites in my childhood were Virol by the spoonful, wonderful.  Also Nestle&#39;s Milk (which was a sweet sticky fluid which came in a white tin) spread on a slice of bread.  Delicious!  I also remember as a child exploring an empty house which my father had bought and finding a large unlabelled tin (probably about 2kg size) of a brown powder, which we tasted.  My sister didn&#39;t like it, but I could not get enough of it.  It turned out to be instant coffee, which I had never seen before, and must explain why these days I am addicted to espresso.....</p>

    <p>I am confused.   Some say Virol was a meat product others say malt extract.  Who is correct?  Loved Virol.  I buy malt extract but has not the same depth of flavor.</p>

    <p>My late husband, born June 1936, had his photograph used in a Virol advertisement when he was a baby, as it was Virol that saved him from a sickly baby to a bouncing baby! I wonder if that advert still exists!</p>

    <p>I remember my mother dishing out Virol to myself and mt brother. Although I love both Bovril and Marmite we both hated Virol and so did some of our friends. We used to call it "Vile".</p>

    <p>I lived in Tufnell Park too from &#39;57 to &#39;67. Adored virol, couldn&#39;t get enough of it. Also rosehip syrup and haliborange vitamin pills. I can hear the squeak of the wrapper on the bottle of lucozade. If I had a temperature mum would carefully open the paper wrapper containing a Beecham&#39;s powder and dissolve it in water. You drank it down as fast as possible then got the lucozade to take away the taste. Survived measles, German measles, mumps, chicken pox, pneumonia - we were made of stern stuff then, and I reckon virol had a lot to do with it.</p>

    <p>I was born in 1951 and although i dont remember being given Virol my mum told me she used to dip my dummy in it. Although she took me to the dentist regularly it did not prevent my second teeth coming through decayed, I also recall having to have several baby teeth extracted. Im convinced the Virol accounted for this happening, through very assiduous care and good dentistry I have most of my natural teeth still, though many are filled, capped, crowned etc. Thank goodness for advances in dentistry but had I not been given Virol this way I feel my oral health wouldnt have suffered in the way it has.</p>
