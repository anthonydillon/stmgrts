    <p>Virol was great, my mother "doled it out" as a treat when my sister and I were "convalescing" from Whooping Cough or Mumps (no MMR in those days). Don&#39;t remember being given at school though. But Martyn is right that no-one seemed to have allergies. Except I do recall one - just one.  At the Christmas school party, about 1960, the teacher suddenly remembered we had a boy with Diabetes in the class and announced to the entire room (50 children + helping adults) that he couldn&#39;t have the usual cake, jelly &amp; ice-cream etc.  His solution for this mortified 9 year old?  "Find him some fruit!" Maybe we were healthier then (no multi-billion food &amp; drink industry advertising on colour telly) but teachers are now certainly better informed and more sensitive.</p>

    <p>I remember Virol especially as my parents had a pharmacy.  We didn&#39;t get it at school although we did get 1/3 pint of milk, which was never in the fridge so it was warm in the summer (eugh!) and frozen in winter (more eugh!).  Interesting history above because Beecham (who produced Horlicks) purchased Bovril, Marmite &amp; Ambrosia from Cavenham Foods.  The company was sold on again to CPC in 1990. My parents used to give us Minadex if we were recovering from colds, cough, tonsilitis etc. and Lucozade with that beautifully  orange cellophaned wrapped bottle.  Rosehip syrup was also popular in the 60s - another very sweet syrup which was good for us and we believed them - a spoonful of sugar and all that!</p>
