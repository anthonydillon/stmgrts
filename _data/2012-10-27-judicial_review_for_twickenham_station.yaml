    <p>The problem with the huge Solum development results from extraordinary costs of &pound;4million for the podium foundations and &pound;6million in Council &#39;contributions&#39;.<br /> That&#39;s why Solum have been allowed to build 8 and 9 storey blocks, with little station improvement, to generate 20% profit for Network Rail and Kier Property</p>

    <p>The Solum scheme would not produce a station fit for purpose. The capacity of the station will be reduced and in Solum&#39;s own words the station will only be "compliant with Network Rail&#39;s minimum standards".</p>  <p>Solum are still stating that the use of Twickenham Railway Station will be minimised during construction. Passengers will be diverted to Richmond, Feltham and Whitton stations.</p>  <p>What will happen to St Margarets Railway Station?</p>

    <p>Presumably, the judge is just as surprised as are thousands of local residents that the Council ignored the highly critical TAP (True&#39;s Advisory Panel) report, and failed to consider alternative station plans such as TRAG&#39;s Plan B.</p>  <p>We would all like a new and efficient station with better facilities for the less able.</p>  <p>We would also like a station that on event days doesn&#39;t cause extended closures of London Road and platform overcrowding/safety issues as a result of the massive London bound queues.</p>  <p>Solum&#39;s scheme, as Ian points out, fails to improve London bound capacity, and with more visitors than ever expected for RWC2015 this is a recipe for disaster.</p>  <p>If the JR is successful Network Rail must start to focus on station improvement rather than property profiteering.</p>

    <p>A small victory for the Nimbies in their struggle to maintain their property valuations. The station redevelopment is desperately needed and TRAG has never properly answered who or how would their "Plan B" station on the cheap be funded. The scaled back mid-rise solution is by far the best and most cost effective solution for the Borough.</p>

    <p>Anyone who thinks Solum&#39;s high rise plans are a good solution needs to read Lord True&#39;s TAP report which criticises multiple.  aspects of the plans.<br /> It also recommends consideration or alternative plans which the Council and Solum failed to do.<br /> The TAP report can be viewed at trag-sos.co.uk</p>

    <p>Twickenham residents must have the opportunity to consider the the highly critical findings of the TAP report, prepared by Lord True&#39;s "honest brokers", before a planning decision is made.  The Council sat on the report for over four months until the planning process was complete. The High Court Judge has agreed that withholding the TAP report was a material consideration.</p>  <p>Residents can make a difference by donating to the Judicial Review Fund (Cheques or Paypal).</p>  <p>Payment details can be found at <a href="http://www.trag-sos.com">www.trag-sos.com</a></p>  <p>Form your own opinion. Don&#39;t let the Council choose what you need to hear.</p>  <p>Best regards,</p>  <p>Ian</p>

    <p>Would you really rather Twickenham Station just stays as it is, and Solum walk away. This is whats likely to happen - its unlikely anything will happen before 2015 now to avoid disruption at the World Cup and once that passess, the focus on Twickenham will fade and you will get your way. No change..ever! I really don&#39;t understand why people are so adverse to change in today&#39;s society. Half of you probably live in houses built as a result of change and development...And now begging for contributions towards the review..makes me very angry.</p>
