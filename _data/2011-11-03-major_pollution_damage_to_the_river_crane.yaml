    <p>We alerted the NRA on 9<sup>th</sup> October. We were surprised to see a crab crawling out of the river by Hill View Road. The river stank with sewage &amp; to be fair the NRA phoned next day to get details.</p>

    <p>Who is responsible for the &#39;defective valve&#39; and its maintenance? What penalties might apply for their failure to maintain it adequately and with such serious consequences?</p>  <p>It&#39;s not clear to me if responsibility lies with Thames Water or another party, such as the British Airports Authority. Whoever it is, the question arises as to whether their maintenance regime was suitable, or if they were scrimping on it.</p>

    <p>I hope that there is good evidence of a satisfactory risk assessment that was done in advance to accompany the method statement for this work.</p>  <p>I am surprised at the length of time taken between discovering the fault and rectifying it.</p>  <p>Was it necessary to plan the work for the Saturday ?  Is there effective engineering back-up to support the work team on a Saturday afternoon ?</p>  <p>I hope the EA investigation will be rigorous.</p>

    <p>I went fishing on the Crane last Sunday morning as I have done many times, I did not see the dead fish at first and had done a few casts. When there was no fish movement I throw some bread in still there was no movement. I then looked down along he bank and started to see the reason why, I could not believe what I saw. There were lots of dead small fish as I then walked along the river there were just dead fish everwhere. I have fished this river for years, how could this be allowed to happen. When I got home I rang the environment agency hotline, I gave them the details but they did not state then they know what was going on they said hey would investigate. I ended up with a rash on my hand where my fishing line had gone across my hand. I would like to know who was responsible for this as I have been give a couple of stories.</p>

    <p><a href="https://twitter.com/Kevin" title="twitter for @Kevin">@Kevin</a> Smith, can you tell me as exactly as possible what time on Sunday morning you started fishing, and about how long before you noticed the dead fish?  This could be quite important.<br /> Thanks, Ed.</p>

    <p>The interests of those living along the lower reaches of the Crane, from the A316 down to where the river empties into the Thames at the end of Railshead Road are represented by the Tidal Crane Association. This informal grouping organises an annual river cleaning day and promotes eco-management along its stretch of the river. We received no notice of the release of sewage or advice on how we should cope with it. Perhaps the foul smelling brown sludge piling up at the bottom of our gardens should have warned us.</p>
