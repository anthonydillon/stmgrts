    <p>I remember this grave very well. It was located on the right hand side of the side entrance to the grounds of St Leonard&#39;s church. The Rev Ferrarro told us that it was the grave of the last man to be flogged to death in the British Army. I must have been about 10 years old at the time and the thought filled me with horror. However the tombstone was not white as is shown in the photograph. I recall it being quite small.</p>
