    <p>St.Mary&#39;s was in fact open this morning.  Almost all staff and pupils were able to make it in.  Unfortunately the school was forced to close at lunch time because they were let down by the catering company, apparently unable to provide meals for the 50 or so pupils who take them.</p>  <p>Just another example of why it&#39;s not such a bright idea to out-source such things I guess.</p>  <p>Ed</p>

    <p>The catering company concerned is called "Sodexo".  The following from <a href="http://uk.sodexo.com/">uk.sodexo.com/</a> :-</p>  <p>" Sodexo has an unrivalled reputation for building lasting partnerships with clients through open, transparent relationships based on trust and exceptional performance.</p>  <p>In the UK and Ireland, our 43,000 people are striving to improve the quality of daily life at more than 2,300 client locations across all market sectors. "</p>  <p>Does non-performance due to a bit of snow really qualify as "exceptional"?  I wonder if all 2,300 of their clients were let down by their 43,000 employees yesterday?!</p>
