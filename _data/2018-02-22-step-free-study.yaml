    <p>Step-free access - one STEP closer</p>  <p>Lib Dem team pledge to make St Margarets step-free by no later than 2022</p>  <p>After years of campaigning, petitions, meetings, and over a year&#39;s worth of letter writing to South Western Railway and Network Rail were moving closer to making St Margarets step free.</p>  <p>As a direct result of the Liberal Democrat campaign, Richmond Council has FINALLY agreed to fund an initial study into the feasibility of our proposed side-gate access via Amyand Park Road.</p>  <p>Councillor Alexander Ehmann said, "It&#39;s great news that after years of pressure by residents and your Lib Dem team, the Conservative-run Council has finally been forced to see sense and fund the study. This is just the first step but its an important step. It shows that we&#39;re winning the battle."</p>  <p>Four years wasted</p>  <p>It has taken years for the Conservative-run council to even take this small step; this could have been done years ago and we would have at least partial step-free access by now. As a result we&#39;ve seen at least four years wasted.</p>  <p>Success - after years of pressure from the Lib Dem team and residents step-free access to St Margarets station is becoming closer to reality.</p>  <p>Cllr Ben Khosa said, "Some people have said this is a cynical pre-election promise by the Tories. Regardless, it has been the Lib Dems working with residents to make the case for step-free access at St Margarets station."</p>  <p>Cllr Geoff Acton said, "If you elect a Lib Dem council in May we give a firm commitment that we will do everything in our power to ensure improved step-free access is in place at St Margarets station by the end of our term."</p>  <p>Cllr Alexander Ehmann added, "St Margarets station needs hard actions not warm words; only a Lib Dem victory in Mays local election will guarantee meaningful progress. We can&#39;t afford another four years of Tory neglect."</p>

    <p>About time too! It should be illegal to have an inaccessible train station and I dont believe Network Rail cant fund it!</p>

    <p>This obviously helps a bit, but not if travelling the other way (towards Richmond &amp; Waterloo) -</p>

    <p>How much will it cost us as council tax payers to work out whether it is feasible to unchain the existing gate onto Amyand Park Road, which offered street level access to 50% of the station users for years after I first moved to St Margarets?</p>

    <p>I don&#39;t quite understand this. It would be lovely to have access from the side gate; but what happens if a wheelchair bound traveller needs to take a train to a destination served by the opposite platform?  Is the feasibility study investigating that prospect?</p>

    <p>It is a good start but there also needs to be better access from the platform to the train. As a disabled resident, St Margarets Station has long been unusable as the gap between the platform and the train is far too high and using a ramp is not an option. If Network Rail and Richmond Council wish to make St Margarets Station a truly accessible station for all, this issue must be addressed.</p>
