    <p>I allow my kids to do it on the basis that the majority of families in our road have young children and also do it.  They are given instructions to leave well alone any house that does not have a lighted pumpkin outside.  I thought that seemed fairly obvious etiquette - no stickers necessary - and everyone has a lot of fun!</p>

    <p>Uncle Ho,</p>  <p>Just so you know, this site is an &#39;American-ism&#39; as it was started and run by an American.  I have to say, &#39;trick or treating&#39; was one of the best events of the year as a child, you have to look at it from a child&#39;s perspective sometimes.</p>  <p>Peter</p>

    <p>Well it&#39;s all passed off for another year, apparently without incident, and as usual there are 3 camps:</p>  <p>Those who believe it&#39;s about devil worship Those who hate ANYTHING American Those who think it&#39;s fun for young children, albeit seized on by the supermarkets as a chocofest.</p>  <p>My children have outgrown it mostly but we still have a pumpkin and we enjoy the family atmosphere around the village. Surely it&#39;s possible to take pleasure in that?</p>
