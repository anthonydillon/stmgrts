    <p>What do they mean when they say "St Margarets Village"? Are they referring to the entire neighbourhood from the River Crane and Old Isleworth to the north, East Twickenham to the south, the Thames to the east and Twickenham to the west - or are they being more selective?</p>  <p>I ask this because St. Margarets has never been a village. It takes its name - no apostrophe - from a house that was built in about 1805 close to where Richmond Lock and footbridge now stand. The parish of St Margarets-upon-Thames (classy, eh?), which runs northwards from the A316 towards Old Isleworth, recognises this fact. The area around St Margarets railway station is in the parish of St. Stephens, while the houses to the west of Moormead Park are in the parish of All Hallows...so if St. Margarets exists at all it is on the north side of the Chertsey Road far from the shops and coffee houses. Incidentally when they first opened St. Margarets Railways Station in 1876 they wanted to call it "Ailsa Bridge"!</p>  <p>Maybe I&#39;m just being cynical but I think that this "St Margarets Village" nonsense is an artifice dreamed up by estate agents. Why can&#39;t we just call ourselves St Margarets and leave it at that?</p>

    <p>Thanks for the historical context for the area. The area was defined by residents in the 2010 All In One survey. Supplementary Planning Documents are being produced that will bring together existing Conservation areas, and newly defined Character areas.</p>  <p>You can see these proposed areas in the downloadable documents, available from the consultation page: <a href="https://consultation.richmond.gov.uk/consultation/vp_vision_stm/consult_view">consultation.richmond.gov.uk/consultation/vp_vision_stm/consult_view</a></p>  <p>We&#39;d appreciate your input, if not already given.</p>

    <p>&#39;St Margarets village&#39; is the name they have given to the part of St Margarets ward east of the River Crane. It&#39;s true the term is also used by estate agents (sometimes to include all of East Twickenham) but that is not what&#39;s happened here.</p>  <p>There is a single Village Plan for the St Margarets and East Twickenham area at <a href="http://www.richmond.gov.uk/st_margarets_and_east_twickenham_village_plan">www.richmond.gov.uk/st_margarets_and_east_twickenham_village_plan</a> . The two areas form a single community, a fact recognised by the old boundary of &#39;East ward&#39; until 2002 (which ran down the middle of Strafford road), reinforced by the close collaboration between Orleans Infants and St Stephen&#39;s Junior schools and expressed by the ward Comments newsletter published by the local Liberals from 1972 but now more or less defunct.</p>  <p>The consultation for East Twickenham is at <a href="https://consultation.richmond.gov.uk/consultation/vp_vision_et/consult_view">consultation.richmond.gov.uk/consultation/vp_vision_et/consult_view</a> . They have defined East Twickenham to be the part of Riverside ward east of Crown Road and Marble Hill park.</p>
