    <p>I suggest St Margarets residents re visit Cllr Khosa CPZ Update posted on 5 July 2006 and read the comments it attracted. Particularly residents north of the A316 as I expect the free all day parking for non residents south of the A316 is coming to an end soon.</p>  <p>Harry Jacobs comments tell it as it is, giving those that are new to the area an insight of CPZ history in St Margarets. History will repeat itself and there is only one direction the non resident parking can go in St Margarets-----north of the A316!</p>
