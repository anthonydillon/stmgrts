    <p>Wow! Genesis were epic in the early 70s. Supper&#39;s Ready, Blood on the Rooftops...<br /> I&#39;m going to check my record collection for Genesis Live right now, and next time I see you I will be inspecting the Day palm with some considerable interest....</p>

    <p>I found this article as I was looking at old images of Genesis on Google whilst listening to the remastered edition of Genesis Live. Back in 1973 I was 16 and it was the first Genesis album I bought as it had all my favourite tracks on it(except "Supper&#39;s Ready"). This article took me back to those prog rock days of the early 70&#39;s, a great story that happens to someone who thought that this job as a roadie with some relatively unknown band is making a part of rock history. No one gets an opportunity like that now, too much red tape, interviews, CRB checks and let&#39;s face it, who want a job with some of the absolute rubbish that is out there right now. Thank you Mr Day for enlightening some of us oldies which remember buying records from a record shop and enjoying proper music with no lip sync&#39;ing<br /> I applaude you!<br /> Terry C<br /> Bass guitarist<br /> Eves Apple</p>
