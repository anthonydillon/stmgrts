    <p>Enjoyed the Newsletter. Has anyone thought of a St Margarets Society or Friends of St Margarets to give it greater focus? This could provide a framework for local events (the St Margarets Fair could fall under the umbrella, as could Crown Road closures etc). The Society could be formalised as what it appears to be already, ie a place for news, route for consultation etc.</p>
