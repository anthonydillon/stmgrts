    <p>I have been a client of Jo Dunbar&#39;s and Botanica Medica in Claygate since my husband and I moved to Surrey in 2000. We have not taken conventional medicine for any condition for about 20 years. If absolutely anything is required for our health, Jo is our first port of call, and she has never failed to prescribe a herbal medicine or remedy that does the trick. My husband had a very serious abscess in his mouth at one time, and even I thought he should take conventional anitbiotics. But he went to see Jo who prescribed herbal antibiotics (which my husband said was stronger than the conventional ones!) and also a herbal poultice to put over the abscess. Both these things healed him brilliantly. We both find Jo&#39;s remedies (and Jo&#39;s love for her herbs) effective and reassuring. We know that she is giving us love and nurturance via the Mother Earth&#39;s herbs and flowers, and the energy of these natural remedies has made us well and kept us well for many years. I encourage everyone to seek out Jo&#39;s special healing herbs for any malady. She is a worthy representative of the love the Great Mother Earth has for her children. We are, after all, living proof of that!<br /> Yasmine Giles</p>
