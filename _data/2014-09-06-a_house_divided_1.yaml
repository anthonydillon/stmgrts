    <p>As a pro-Unionist (and pro-EU ) I am terrified at the outcome of the referendum on  Scottish independence engineered by the slickest British politician I can recall.  I worked for 10 years with 2 of the most bigoted people it has been my misfortune to encounter, from Glasgow.  While I also encountered other less strident Scots, I was left in no doubt of the SNP&#39;s "hatred of the English".<br /> If there is a narrow vote against independence, the SNP bile and bitterness will merely fuel that resentment.<br /> If the vote is for independence the UK government will go into overdrive trying to present a case of "business as usual" except it won&#39;t be the UK or Great Britain and the resulting economic de-stabilisation will make the current recession seem like a picnic.</p>

    <p>Having just read the Sunday papers it seems that it&#39;s only the Scots that are getting themselves all worked up over the vote and very few this side of the boarder seem at all interested, reading some of the rhetoric being churned out has given me some of the best laughs in years, As an Englishman I have no interest whatsoever in what way they decide to vote as it won&#39;t make any difference to my way of life, and besides it&#39;s nothing to do with us, leave it to the Scots to decide.</p>

    <p>Alsie;  it&#39;s "border" not "boarder".  No point in commenting on anything else.</p>
