    <p>I watched the first 5 minutes plus a few excerpts further in.  Chaired by "Richard" vicar of All Souls/Saints (?).  He didn&#39;t appear to introduce the panel and even with hand held mics, very difficult to hear what people were saying.  Seemed most people just wanted to "say something" rather than ask a question.  Third excerpt in, people still talking about the toucan crossing.  Good idea but a work-in-progress?</p>
