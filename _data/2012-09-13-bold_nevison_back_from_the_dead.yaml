    <p>Martin, I am delighted to read your revival and accurate accounts, as best can be ascertained, about certain micreancies by an individual of Nevison lineage those years ago. You will probably be delighted to know albeit living in TW7 Isleworth my mother, Mrs Nevison, still uses the Crown Surgery from earlier residence of our family in the Police section houses on St Margerets Road, since sold off by the the Home Office. Yes, my father, Mr John Nevison was a police officer! I can only suggest some families throw up black sheep of note. My final comment goes to those loyal to the King at the time of Cromwell and tonrhe reformation, as Nevison served the Duke of York under Charles I would have left the service of such bodies as Customs, not for money or ilk, but to attack their collectors as remaining soldiers loyal to the Crown. A loyalty our family still holds firm. Best wishes, Jonathan Nevison.</p>
