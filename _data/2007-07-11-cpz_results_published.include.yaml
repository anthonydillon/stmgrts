    <p>Gerhard,</p>  <p>UPDATED: I miss read the column!</p>  <p>Railshead Road	had 26 surveys sent with only 4 people replying (a 15% response rate) all <em>for the CPZ</em>.  75% support joining the CPZ if everyone else gets one and 75% support a &#39;car club&#39; scheme.</p>  <p>Look at <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2f4ww5">tinyurl.com/2f4ww5,</a>, Appendix B for the details.</p>  <p>Peter</p>

    <p>According to the Council&#39;s spreadsheet of replies they had none from Cole Park View(6 houses only). I know for a fact that 3 definitely replied and almost certainly 1 more."To lose one parent Mr Worthing might be regarded as a misfortune, to lose two looks like carelessness" - as to losing all our replies one can only draw one conclusion. Anyway the parking problem is solved. Cole Park Road has voted against so the whole Moormead area will ease up when they join the rest of our community.</p>

    <p>It seems the council are going ahead with the next stage of the CPZ despite the results of the questionnaire - see below</p>  <p><a href="http://www.richmond.gov.uk/home/view_member_decisions.htm?mgl=ieDecisionDetails.asp&amp;ID=1251">www.richmond.gov.uk/home/view_member_decisions.htm?mgl=ieDecisionDetails.asp&amp;ID=1251</a></p>

    <p>I have asked this before but not received a reply. Why does Sidney Road not appear in the CPZ list. I certainly voted.</p>

    <p>John,</p>  <p>Look at the report itself or the bottom chart.</p>  <p>I did not list the roads that were in the middle as the list was too long.  However Sydney was about 50 - 50...</p>  <p>Peter</p>
