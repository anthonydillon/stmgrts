    <p>Hmm, more gastro than pub having visited on Friday, rather like the Turk&#39;s. But then, that is where the profits are.</p>

    <p>A notice in the window of the Crown says it won&#39;t open until early &#39;13, due to &#39;a delay in getting planning permission&#39;.</p>

    <p>This place has been closed and refurbed and it&#39;s now DREADFUL. Most of the staff are horrible, sour faced and have extremely bad customer services. I&#39;ve spoken to other people and they are put off by the price hikes and horrid new staff too. You will pay well over the odds in this pub now for crap food and the same drinks are double the price of other nearby pubs. We have been spending approx 50 quid a week at this pub, which was offensive enough for a few drinks. Over 20 quid for a bottle of vinegar wine, nearly 10 quid for a pint of my favourite lager. And we certainly wont be going back after the rude staff, the young skinny blonde is particularly rude. This place wont last 5 minutes now word is getting around. Sorry we wont put up with these extortionate and rude services in St Margarets - people use your feet to vote!</p>
