    <p>Martyn,</p>  <p>What a wonderful piece. And I am deeply indebted to you for explaining why busses travel in convoys.</p>  <p>As Michael Cain allegedly said (although he denies ever having saying it) "there&#39;s not a lot of people know that".</p>  <p>St Margarets dot org - completing the education of the residents of St Margarets.</p>  <p>Keep up the good work</p>  <p>Regards</p>  <p>Chris</p>

    <p>I agree with Chris Harrison. It&#39;s a delight to receive the St Margarets newsletter every week.  I&#39;ve learned a lot of interesting information from it!</p>

    <p>First hand comment I have heard from a "lazy" driver many years ago................I like to follow the bus in front because it means the driver in front has to do all the work and I can take it easy.</p>  <p>Personally being a cyclist I would opt for METHOD 4</p>  <p>Cllr Ben Khosa</p>

    <p>There is a No.37 bus in the London Transport Museum; I seem to remember it&#39;s an open-top. My late grandfather, who lived in Peckham, was a conductor on this route in the 1920s and I believe he met (&#39;pulled?&#39;) my grandmother on a No.37 as she travelled to work. That was in the days when you saw the same driver and conductor every day.</p>
