    <p>I found mine - on Tuesday evening - halfway up my shed door, which is budgeted for removal next year!  Former members of Orleans Infants Stag Beetles Class may remember the trip to Kew Gardens to see their habitat.  Those were the days..........</p>

    <p>I&#39;m sure the stag beetles aren&#39;t going to enjoy the proposed new floodlights on Twickenham Riverside at Twickenham Lawn Tennis Club. Get in touch if you are interested in opposing this proposal to damage the habitat of the stag beetle</p>

    <p>I have heard before that stag beetles only appear in areas of the country that have a chalk strata geology base. Great that we have them in our area. Maybe Martyn could have a stag party now!</p>
