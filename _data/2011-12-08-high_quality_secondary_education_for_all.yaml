    <p>The Local Authority are proposing that Orleans lose its link status with primary schools such as St Mary&#39;s, St Stephen&#39;s, Chase bridge, Worple Primary and the Blue School. Very difficult to predict, but this just may have a particular effect on those St Margarets residents living above the A316 who are not particularly near any Richmond secondary. So just as the path to a all-through local Primary (St Stephen&#39;s) within walking distance looks like being cleared once and for all, a block could appear for us Northerners when the anticipated bulge goes through at secondary level in about 2015. Or have I missed something?</p>  <p>If you want to reply to the consultation, read on (from the Council website):</p>  <p>From Tuesday 15th November 2011 until Friday 13th January 2012, the Council will be consulting upon the 2013/2014 admission arrangements for community schools within the borough. Apart from the relevant dates of the coordinated admissions schemes, the only proposed change from the current (and 2012/2013) arrangements is the removal of the &#39;linked school&#39; criterion from the oversubscription criteria for Grey Court, Orleans Park and Teddington. That means that &#39;home to school distance&#39; would instead be the main criterion for determining allocations for the three schools.</p>  <p>The full consultation document relating to the overall arrangements and a shorter document relating solely to the proposed removal of the &#39;linked school&#39; criterion can be found and downloaded here:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.richmond.gov.uk/home/education_and_learning/schools_and_colleges/school_admissions.htm">www.richmond.gov.uk/home/education_and_learning/schools_and_colleges/school_admissions.htm</a></p>  <p>Consultation responses should be made, by the closing-date of 13th January 2012, to: Matthew Paul, Head of School Commissioning, at:  <a href="mailto:m.paul@richmond.gov.uk">m.paul@richmond.gov.uk</a>.</p>  <p>Richmond upon Thames Admissions Forum will consider the responses at its meeting on 6 February 2012 and seek consensus to make a recommendation to the Council&#39;s Cabinet, which will consider the proposed changes, and the responses to them, at its meeting on 22 March 2012.</p>

    <p>&#39;Abolishing the &#39;linked schools&#39; system: who gains? who loses? A forecast for Orleans Park&#39; is at: <a href="http://twickenhamlibdems.co.uk/en/article/2011/523396/abolishing-the-linked-schools-system-who-gains-who-loses-a-forecast-for-orleans-park">twickenhamlibdems.co.uk/en/article/2011/523396/abolishing-the-linked-schools-system-who-gains-who-loses-a-forecast-for-orleans-park</a></p>  <p>&#39; . . Pupils who were at one of the former link schools but live more than about 1.5 km away would definitely not get into OPS. Matthew Paul [the Council officer who oversee admissions] suggests that north St Margarets "should be" within the catchment, but I don&#39;t think he has taken into account the expected large number of applications from parents of children at the Vineyard . . &#39;</p>
