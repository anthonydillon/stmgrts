    <p>I feel that the gesture by the Council which effectively makes it more expensive to park outside your own home rules out any chance of my part of St.Margarets joining the rest of the "village" (OK Richard, 1/12/06, it felt like a village when I moved here in 1994) and allowing me to park anywhere in Zone S. As a 2 car family, one of which has a Disabled badge, we know only too well the inconvenience of the current arrangement.  We also know what an improvment a CPZ brings to an area - far fewer cars during the day, better access, improved safety, it even looks nicer(just compare Broadway Avenue with Bridge Road when St.Stephen&#39;s School finishes) - as Zone S did not exist in 1994. I would be only too willing to pay up for all that but I suspect most people are happy for commuters to park free all day and get the train from St.Margarets or leave their car here for 2-3 weeks rather than pay at Heathrow while they go on holiday. After all we only live here. Ian</p>
