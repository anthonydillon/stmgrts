    <p>Good article, well written. I can help clear up the scoreline of the 1866 London XI v Sheffield F.C match, it all revolves around Law 7.</p>  <p>The original wording of the Football Association&#39;s Laws of the Game Law 7 from the 1<sup>st</sup> Dec 1863 read:-</p>  <p>"In case the ball goes behind the goal-line: if a player on the same side to whom the goal belongs first touches the ball, one of his side shall he entitled to a free-kick from the goal-line at the point opposite the place where the ball shall be touched. If a player of the opposite side first touches the ball, one of his side shall be entitled to a free-kick (but at the goal only) from a point 15 yards from the goal-line opposite the place where the ball is touched; the opposing side shall stand behind the goal-line until he has had his kick."</p>  <p>However, Law 7 was changed at the A.G.M of the F.A on the 22nd Feb 1866 to read:-</p>  <p>"In case the ball goes behind the goal-line: a player on the side to whom the goal shall kick it off from the goal-line at the point opposite the place where it is touched by a player with any part of his body. But if a player of the opposite side first touches the ball after it has gone behind the goal-line of his adversary, one touch-down shall be scored by his side; and in the event of no goal being got on either side, or an equal number of goals being got on each side, the side obtaining the greater number of touches-down shall be the winners of the match."</p>  <p>Law 7 was changed yet again at the A.G.M of the F.A on the 26th Feb 1867 to read:-</p>  <p>"When the ball is kicked behind the goal-line it must be kicked-off by the side behind whose goal it went within 6 yards from the limit of their goal; the side who kick the ball are entitled to a fair kick-off in whatever way they please without any obstruction, the opposite side not being allowed to approach within 6 yards of the ball."</p>  <p>So at the time of the match in question (31st Mar 1866), it was possible to score a touch-down. However, strictly speaking it should have only been counted if the match ended in a draw. Bell&#39;s Life (7th Apr 1866) recorded the result as London, two goals, four touches-down; Sheffield, none.</p>  <p>So there you have it, for 12 months only, it was possible to score a touch-down under F.A Laws</p>
