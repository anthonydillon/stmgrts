Please have a look at Adam Rutherford&#39;s series of articles (The Guardian) commenting on the contents of the Alpha course.  Here&#39;s a link to one<br /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2009/feb/02/evolution-creationism-darwin-theos">www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2009/feb/02/evolution-creationism-darwin-theos</a><br /> The promotion of creationism - flying in the face of science / current knowledge - <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/beliefs/creationism_1.shtml">www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/beliefs/creationism_1.shtml</a><br /> and the Alpha attitude to homosexuality  <a href="http://www.galha.org/critique-of-alpha-course-attitude-towards-homosexuality/">www.galha.org/critique-of-alpha-course-attitude-towards-homosexuality/</a> are 2 areas of the Alpha course that I find particularly irrational.<br /> thanks for listening<br /> Gail Rooke</p>
