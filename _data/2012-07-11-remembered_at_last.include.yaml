    <p>Many people under occupation in Europe said their only hope was the sound of our bombers overhead. It&#39;s terrible that so many decent and hardworking German citizens died like this but the blame lies squarely with their leadership. The bonbing lads were heroes, every last one of them. DAVE</p>

    <p>Your articles are always very interesting and greatly appreciated.</p>  <p>This account is very sad. To learn that a brave volunteer(one of many no doubt)of WW11 whose personal experience haunted him for the rest of his life is cruel. How sad no one was able to persuade him of his contribution to a successful outcome which brought Freedom for us all. How things have changed. Or have they?</p>

    <p>Having recently watched "Heroes of the Skies" on Tv and reading this article, I have been overwhelmed with emotion with the bravery shown by these young men. It was a disgrace that their bravery went unrecognised for so long, but thankfully, we now have a fitting memorial to those heroes.</p>

    <p>Leslie Harris was my cousin and I have only just discovered the details of how he lost his life... I found brief information from the RAAF Museum in Perth which prompted me to look further until I found this account of the tragedy for which I am saddened but happy to at last know the true facts - Thank you...</p>
