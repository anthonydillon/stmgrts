    <p>I am not happy to see that Tesco seem to be ignoring the rules applied to everybody else. I think most of us are happy to use Tesco but Tesco also need to respect their neighbours and to be considerate of our neighbourhood.</p>  <p>I find it very annoying that the Council would not allow the Post Office to have a cashpoint machine without asking what people wanted and Tesco put one in with out permission and then the Council grant it. Who is looking after St Margarets interests here?</p>

    <p>Aside from all the valid comments re. vans obstructing and congesting St Margarets and the flouting of tradition and laws......Tesco&#39;s food is rubbish. If one care&#39;s about their health and their families health don&#39;t buy food which is vacum packed with chemicals to preserve them, unripe and tasteless and farmed out of season from exploited farmers, overpriced and without a single local product in sight.</p>  <p>Fresh fruit and vegetables can be bought from a fruit and veg shop a few yards away, fresh organic bread a few yards further.  In addition to superior quality, better prices and a wider variety we should be supporting the local businesses which make St Margarets the community it is!</p>
