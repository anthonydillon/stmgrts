    <p>There may be much that is wrong with &#39;Twickers&#39; but it&#39;s a good studio, good films are made there and it provides work for great talent - so what if it is a bit long in the tooth - remember the old addage about tunes and fiddles and let&#39;s not forget how Guido had ups and downs but kept going</p>

    <p>I was really saddened to hear the news about the studios. I grew up and have lived in the area for most of my life and was always so proud to learn that some of the greatest films were filmed there. I phoned the studios to ask if they were running any tours before it closed, but although they had thought to do so, time is too short to plan them. I agree it would be lovely to save it, if we can. And I also support the idea that we do not want any more executive homes...we DO need more schools though!</p>

    <p>Maria, Thank you for starting this petition  -  I hoped someone with the know-how would. I couldn&#39;t believe it when I heard Twickenham Film Studios was going to be sold to property developers for demolition. Yet another piece of our local (and film) history lost forever. Perhaps the petition details could also be published in The Richmond and Twickenham Times newspaper and any other local newspaper (is The Richmond Guardian still around?  -  we haven&#39;t seen it for years). You would get so many more supporters who aren&#39;t subscribers to the St. Margarets Community Newsletter. Facebook and Twitter are great, but local papers are still the best way to reach local people who care. Best of luck with it.</p>

    <p>What a fantastic opportunity for a new school! I wonder whether this has been considered by the council?</p>

    <p>The RTT reports: &#39; . . Developer Taylor Wimpey intends to develop the land . . (they) said: "(we) and the current owners of Twickenham Film Studios are exploring the potential for the site to be redeveloped for a mixed use scheme, providing employment space alongside a mixture of residential dwellings." . . Cllr Chris Harrison told residents that . . because the council did not own the site, it had no power over who the studios are sold to . . (the) Studios recently went into administration and its finances are currently being managed by Begbies Traynor.&#39;</p>  <p><a href="http://www.richmondandtwickenhamtimes.co.uk/news/richmondnews/9566859.Campaigns_launched_as_developer_makes_plans_for_Twickenham_Studios/?ref=eb">www.richmondandtwickenhamtimes.co.uk/news/richmondnews/9566859.Campaigns_launched_as_developer_makes_plans_for_Twickenham_Studios/?ref=eb</a></p>

    <p>Never mind the fact that I&#39;ve worked there and like the place, for purely practical reasons Twickenham Film Studios should be saved. It employs people with valuable expertise, it brings in foreign currency and it exports product (a phrase from the post WW2 period was &#39;Export or Die&#39; and if I&#39;m not mistaken, we&#39;re in a similar situation now). More housing won&#39;t help the economy. If the company has financial problems...step forward bankers and redeem youselves!</p>

    <p>I worked for many years at Shepperton Film Studios when it too was under threat of closure. Fortunately those studios were saved from short sighted redevelopment and are now flourishing to the benefit of the community, the industry and the nation. The same could easily happen in Twickenham if we can stop this needless closure. Jeremy Hunt lives up to his nickname yet again eh? .</p>

    <p>There are many reasons for saving Twickenham Studios, not least of which is the contribution they make to the local economy. The cafes, restaurants and shops that we use and enjoy exist because of the Studios and the many people who work there. Destroy the Studios and you effectively destroy St. Margarets.</p>

    <p>I have been in &#39;the business&#39; for many years and I am appalled by the lack of interest in keeping one of our greatests industries alive by the government. We DO NOT NEED more exclusive homes to be built on the site! We need our film industry, the best in the world to be kept going. Come on all those who have made it to get together and help to save this wonderful piece of history!</p>
