    <p>What a great evening. NOT! Yes the event was well organised and yes lots to do. But one very unhappy little boy had his evening ruined by some stupid person who lifted his wallet out of his pocket! i know its not the Crown Road Organises fault. But i Hope this shames the person who did it.</p>

    <p>Amanda,</p>  <p>What a selfish comment. The fact that a little boy lost his wallet is hardly the fault of Jamie Parker, (still a boy himself) who organised both the Christmas and the Septenber event and who, in my view did a grand job on both occasions. The fact that the only comment from the residents of St Margarets about the Christmas event was "What a great evening. NOT!" is quite frankly sad.</p>

    <p>I&#39;m sure the lack of comment on the Christmas Fair (apart from the stolen wallet) doesn&#39;t in any way reflect people&#39;s enjoyment of the night. Not everyone uses this website very often and the way items are posted means that they slip down out of sight very quickly. That said,I hope Jamie knows how much his efforts have been appreciated and wish him all good luck in the next year with important exams looming.</p>  <p>I&#39;m sure if some photos/ feedback on charities etc are posted up on the web, there will be lots of positive comment.</p>
