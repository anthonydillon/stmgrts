    <p>Can someone please provide a link to the MINI HOLLAND BID made by Richmond Council in 2013?<br /> Not many local residents appear to be aware of the detailed plans and how they might be affected by the changes.</p>

    <p>Yes, thank you Peter.</p>  <p>I hope that it will encourage cyclists, pedestrians and drivers using the A316 as part of their daily commute to comment.</p>  <p>Gerhard</p>
