    <p>The property has 3 habitable stories, and 5+ rooms to let, and shared facilities - It&#39;s an HMO.</p>

    <p>Thanks for this most useful article; some comments on behalf of your ward councillors:</p>  <p>1: HMO = House for Multiple Occupation [a planning category];<br /> 2: In all correspondence, please quote the Application No: 09/0703/COU;<br /> 3: the closing date is in fact Thursday July 24;<br /> 4: Cllr Philip Morgan will speak for local residents at the meeting of the planning committee [as he did for the previous application]. It would be helpful if you would send him a copy of your comments so that he is fully aware of residents&#39; views; please don&#39;t send them to Ben Khosa, who is fully occupied in his role as Deputy Mayor.<br /> 5: Description: &#39;A single dwelling with rooms to let on a multiple occupancy basis with 8 rooms to let out with a communal kitchen, living room, 2 shower rooms and a bathroom. We don&#39;t require any parking permits for the property.&#39;</p>

    <p>Chris - thanks for your comments on behalf of our councillors. I am concerned about point 5.</p>  <p>&#39;We don&#39;t require any parking permits for the property.&#39; This is a confusing statement from which can be drawn misleading inferences.</p>  <p>Mr. Massie, the property&#39;s developer,  will not be a resident. He will not have the right to apply for parking permits. The tenants of the hostel will have such a right, however, and will not be bound by the developer&#39;s statement of intent.</p>  <p>Mr. Massie has stated that the hostel&#39;s target market will be "young professionals".</p>  <p>8 "young professionals" will mean 8 cars. The residents will have guests, who will also have cars. This will mean far greater congestion, noise and pollution in the streets immediately surrounding this misplaced scheme.</p>

    <p>The description is taken from the application.</p>  <p>I think this hostel is aimed at the very cheap end of the market, i.e. transient immigrant workers who wish to save every penny to remit back home. So one can imagine a group of them having car between them to get to work, which they would indeed be entitled to leave parked on the public road overnight just as anyone else can.</p>  <p>I would not expect such residents to be noisy, as they would be working all hours, returning only to sleep. They would create less disturbance than their long established leisured neighbours with their late night parties and smelly barbeques.</p>  <p>40 years ago when I cam to East Twickenham, it was known as &#39;bedsit land&#39; and was much cheaper and more mixed than it is now. So this scheme is no more than a return to the status quo ante gentrification.</p>

    <p>The idea of 8 (or quite possibly more) people sharing one car seems ridiculous to me.  This is highly unlikely.  And is the above comment saying we should turn St. Margarets back into a down market district fill of overcrowded poor quality housing?  Even if a condition is imposed removing the right of tenants to apply for parking permits this does not stop them parking their cars before 10am or after 4pm on weekdays (which suits anyone who drives to work).  So either way this application would lead to a large increase in parking problems for people who live on Crown Road and the neighbouring streets.</p>

    <p>I am not advocating anything: I am simply providing a wider view based on recent history. As a property owner I certainly don&#39;t want the area to go down market but this might happen for reasons now unforeseen. Houses next to the Crane, for example, might find themselves &#39;redlined&#39; by the insurance companies because of the flood risk.</p>  <p>The new class of private landlord will, as in this case, seek new ways to make a profit from their properties by satisfying demands that other settled residents are unaware of. If they get a grip on a street and change its character, it may indeed go down market, as has happened in many university towns; I learnt last weekend that the same has happened in Milton Keynes: once mixed neighbourhoods are becoming segregated into &#39;respectable&#39; neighbourhoods dominated by house proud owner occupiers and down at heel ones dominated by private landlords. The landlords have an interest in encouraging this change as it enables them to buy up property more cheaply.</p>

    <p>Mr Squire,</p>  <p>You speak as though the decline back into "bedsit land" is a fait accompli and out of our control!<br /> The area does not need to "go downmarket for reasons unforeseen". The slide back to "bedsit land" can be halted if the Council listens to the voices of local residents and rejects innappropriate and poorly conceived development applications.  How does a low-rent bedsit benefit our community?</p>

    <p>This property now appears to be for sale throught Chase Buchanan - though they are not admitting to this on their website. What does this mean? It would be a brave person who bought it right now with its status in limbo.</p>

    <p>Where is the evidence that this house is for sale? there is no stake board outside it, no picture in the CB window and  nothing on their website.</p>

    <p>There was a stakeboard at the time of writing. Otherwise, I wouldn&#39;t have posted, would I?(And I said at the time there was nothing on the website.)</p>  <p>Maybe it was an error by CBs board-placers.</p>

    <p>I think St Margarets Residents can relax.<br /> The application has been refused under delegated<br /> powers on 10 August 2009.</p>

    <p>Excellent news. Wonder what the owner plans to do now with their modified premises? They will get much less for it than had they sold it as a needs-work family house, plus having wasted money on the rebuild. Serves them right for their being so presumptive!</p>

    <p>The Officer&#39;s Report [14 Aug 2009] has been published at: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/mcmkbn">tinyurl.com/mcmkbn</a> It states:</p>  <p>&#39; . . The proposed conversion . . would result in a cramped and unsuitable form of accommodation for future occupants with little room to accommodate cycle and refuse storage. The increase in occupants on the site notwithstanding the restrictions on parking permits through a legal agreement would result in a detrimental impact of local parking conditions  and the amenities enjoyed by by the occupants of adjacent residential properties.</p>  <p>Recommendation: refuse.&#39;</p>

    <p>The house is now the subject of aplanning application - 09/2698/COU for a change of use to a single family dwelling house. Sensible floorplans are part of the application, as are "current" ones showing it under the doctor&#39;s surgery layout! It&#39;s also on the market , planning permission pending, with Chase Buchanan at &pound;735K. Looks like the developer, fingers thoroughly burned, has turned tail.</p>
