    <p>I grew up in St Margarets and was quite young when the Beatles were at the film studios. Luckily my mother was a fan, and she took my sister and me along when she waited outside the studios to get a glimpse of the fab four leaving after a day&#39;s filming. I can remember Paul driving his Mini though the studio gates with Jane Asher, his then girlfriend, in the passenger seat besieged by press and screaming fans! Also the day they filmed Ringo in a market scene outside the Turks Head for Hard Days Night. I was at St Stephens School, lined up on the chain link fence trying to get a glimpse. And I was there in Ailsa Avenue for the filming of Help when the Beatles walked into four individual, specially painted front doors - in the film we cut to a large room inside. I&#39;m still a fan!</p>
