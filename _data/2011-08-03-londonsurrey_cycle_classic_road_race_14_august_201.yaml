    <p>Audrey,</p>  <p>I don&#39;t know, I would check with <a href="http://www.theaa.com">www.theaa.com</a> or <a href="http://www.rac.co.uk">www.rac.co.uk</a> ?</p>  <p>I assume they will know about the closures and offer alternate routes.</p>  <p>Best of luck,</p>  <p>Peter</p>

    <p>I am very excited about the 2011 London-Surrey Cycle Classic Road Race as I am volunteering! Wow! Can&#39;t wait to play my part as part of the huge number of dedicated volunteers who have signed up. See you all on Sunday 14th August. Let&#39;s hope it will be a great day and very memorable.</p>  <p>Bill Duperouzel Leighton Buzzard</p>

    <p>Is it likely that the cycle race will go ahead on the 14th, due to all the riots and demands on the police time.</p>

    <p>Tracy,</p>  <p>I certainly hope so and have seen nothing to the contrary.</p>  <p>Peter</p>

    <p>With a son seriously ill in a london hospital all i can say is, who gives a damn. I think its outrageous that all these roads are closed. Surely if they wanted to test the route they could do it with just one or two riders. Who gives a damn about the bike race. Has anyone thought about all those that HAVE to use the roads. As far as we are concerned the sooner this poxy race is over the better. Hopefully it will rain !!</p>

    <p>I had an urgent request to visit family living in Ham only to find the whole place entirely surrounded by a cycle route. I would have thought a less circular route should have been considered  enabling people to get in and out of Ham/Richmond at the very least.  Very inconvenient and inconsiderate and I am a cyclist!  How do you suggest I approach Ham on the 14th August from Maidenhead - any ideas?</p>

    <p>Again, this site isn&#39;t the best for checking routes; however...</p>  <p>Audrey - looks like you could take the A3 with not problems from Thames Ditton</p>  <p>J.Cooke - can you come after 11.30am?  otherwise, I think you will struggle to reach Ham in a car.  You <em>could</em> probably get there via the passenger ferry in Marble Hill Park by walking from St Margarets after 9.30am, or the person bridge at Teddington Lock, parking in Teddington a bit later.</p>  <p>Again, check with the AA or RAC or <a href="http://www.richmond.gov.uk/olympic_test_event">www.richmond.gov.uk/olympic_test_event</a>.</p>  <p>Peter</p>

    <p>Jacqui,</p>  <p>Whilst I understand that your son is seriously ill, I don&#39;t think you should vent your anger on a one day bike race: let&#39;s hope it&#39;s sunny!</p>

    <p>J Kelly</p>  <p>Can&#39;t you just come around the M25 on the North and get off at Chertsey and shirt the outside of the race?</p>  <p>Again, check with the AA or RAC.</p>  <p>Peter</p>

    <p>It&#39;s a rubbish day, stupid idea.  Jacqui I feel very sorry for you I&#39;m in the same position with my mum and I honestly believe if this was better planned they could always have a route open. At the moment I&#39;m stuck in Hampton Wick and can&#39;t move anywhere. What worry&#39;s me is next year there is going to be three days like this... I genuinely hope the olympics gets called off.</p>

    <p>Looks like i ain&#39;t getting to work today... Stupid organisers know nothing about getting the public behind the Olympics do they?!  They could have a manned traffic system to allow people access if bikes aren&#39;t near by... Or soon as bikes pass, start clearing up the road. If anything of the past week with riots is to go bye, this is gonna upset people  next year if closed for three days! Thinking about it, why didn&#39;t organisers send a map To each affected household with roads closed and Help with alternative routes?!</p>
