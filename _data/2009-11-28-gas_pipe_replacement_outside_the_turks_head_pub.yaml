    <p>Why are the Councillors apologising for something the Council has nothing to do with?</p>

    <p>The council has something to do with these works, it<br /> has to ensure public safety while the works are in progress.<br /> Even though the works are unavoidable it would not surprise me if some people complained to Councillors about the inconvenience caused.</p>  <p>So why should the Councillors not apologise for the unavoidable inconvenience caused?</p>  <p>If nothing else, it shows they are aware and sympathize with those that are affected.</p>
