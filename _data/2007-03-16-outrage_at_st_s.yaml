    <p>Are all the other groups who use the park charged to do so - i.e. the numerous football groups, cricket  etc?</p>

    <p>Before we start a revolt here lets just get things into perspective and determine some facts.</p>  <p>It is my information that all schools that do not have dedicated playing fields get a grant from the council to help pay for sports provision to support the curriculum.</p>  <p>In the case of St Stephens I think they received something in the order of &pound;1300/1400.</p>  <p>If they were previously paying a lot less there may be a reason for it and since the council offices are closed I cannot determine the facts or the figures till Monday when I shall report back.</p>  <p>I know St Stephens is charged in line with other schools that do not have dedicated facilities. Our Borough charges are in line with other Boroughs having gone up only in line with inflation I believe.</p>  <p>Cllr Ben Khosa</p>

    <p>Ben,</p>  <p>Thanks for helping.  I have attempted to get some information from the Council on this before posting the article, and I assume there is a valid reason (note the poll question &#39;Depends on Council Reason&#39;) but have heard nothing back.</p>  <p>Peter</p>

    <p>I got involved in this back in February when I was informed by officers of their optimism of dealing with the issue effectively. I also wrote to the Acting Head and offered to help if needed.</p>  <p>I have had no response to that offer and since I believe all efforts should be made to redress a wrong (should there be one) before taking up arms, I feel this current action is a tad premature and sensationalises the issue rather than trying to deal with it.</p>  <p>I understand the parents concerns and will do all I can to help.</p>  <p>Cllr Ben Khosa</p>

    <p>Sounds familiar to me. We had the cricket fees hiked from &pound;250 to &pound;2000. It was discounted to &pound;780 if we stood on one leg and scratched our armpit.  Result, no more cricket.</p>  <p>Alistair - Crossbats Cricket Club - Moormead</p>

    <p>If Alistair would forward me fuller details of his complaint I would be happy to investigate.</p>  <p>Re. charges for St Stephens pitch Hire the council is conducting a review which should be concluded by the end of this week, meanwhile all previously issued invoices are shelved. There has been no increase in the rate of charging (all schools in a similar situation pay an hourly charge which goes towards the maintainance of the pitch used) other than a recent 2.5% RPI increase.</p>  <p>So given the above is true something else in the formula must have changed and all that is being investigated and will be reported asap.</p>  <p>It is my firmly held belief that this council is not in the buisness of unjustly riding rough shod over residents interests and this issue could have been more effectivly dealt with had proper lines of communication been used.</p>  <p>Cllr Ben Khosa</p>

    <p>What a shame!</p>  <ul> <li>Losing cricket</li> <li>Charging non-profit groups for using a facility we pay for with our Council Taxes</li> </ul>  <p>... what would the Council do without the money, stop cutting the lawns?</p>  <p>You would think with the Olympics coming in 2012 the borough would be trying to get more sports on the mead!</p>

    <p>I am informed that the Council send a cleaner once a fortnight to clear the rubbish. I take that on trust. However during the intervening period I remove, sometimes a whole black sack full, from Little Moormead. I shall now make a suitable charge to the Council- let&#39;s say  &pound;100 a session?</p>

    <p>Ben,</p>  <p>It&#39;s all very well talking of "proper lines of communication" and sensationalism and so on - but frankly, our taxes pay for all this already.</p>  <p>A bit more intelligence and common sense, and a bit less bureacracy are what are needed here.</p>  <p>Regards</p>  <p>Ed</p>

    <p>Sorry for the lack of intelligence Ed but I have asked my wife to include more fish in the dinner menu.</p>  <p>Situation with St Stephens seems to have been resolved satisfactorily as well so I hope it all helps</p>  <p>Cllr Ben Khosa</p>
