    <p>Hi there, My wife and kids had a wonderful time today when they came to the Playcentre for the first time. The range of play equipment sounds great and they said how fantastic the staff inside were.</p>  <p>Unfortunately they found the comments and attitude of the doorman (Ted/Ned?)somewhat rude when asking my wife to fill in the entry form and telling my four year old he couldn&#39;t come in. I think all the points he made were very valid but the manner a little too sharp and smart!</p>  <p>Thought you would like to know and hear the feedback.</p>

    <p>Glad your family enjoyed the A.P and hope you will come again, as you said, the reasons 4 year olds are not allowed in are not only valid but a legal requirement. I am not the doorman i am the Senior Playworker and i apologise if your wife believed my attitude to be somewhat rude,It was never intended to be. I have never told nor would i ever tell a child that they are not allowed in the playground, that is the responsibility of their parent. However if a parent tells a child that &#39;the man won&#39;t let you in&#39; i will defend myselfand my team robustly.</p>  <p>Ted not Ned  <a href="mailto:%6D%68%70%63%40%74%61%6C%6B%74%61%6C%6B%2E%6E%65%74">mhpc@talktalk.net</a></p>
