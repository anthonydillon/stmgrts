    <p>So, let me understand this properly.  All those Church of England primaries - St.Stephen&#39;s, St.Mary&#39;s etc - ARE NOT &#39;Faith" schools?</p>

    <p>The term &#39;faith school&#39; is used loosely; the correct term is &#39;church school&#39;. What matters is the set of admission criteria used to decide which child gets a place, which vary. Some require church attendance and some do not. See, for Richmond&#39;s schools: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/3pw4nac">tinyurl.com/3pw4nac</a></p>  <p>In general Catholic schools use much stricter criteria, particularly for secondary schools, requiring regular attendance at Mass and a recommendation from the local priest; here is the admission policy for the Catholic Richard Challoner School for Boys in New Malden:</p>  <p>&#39;Where the number of applicants exceed the number of places within any of the above categories,  the following tie breakers will be applied in the order stated, using the following criteria:</p>  <ol> <li>The strength of evidence of commitment to the applicant&#39;s faith, where appropriate,  as demonstrated by the child&#39;s level of Mass attendance on a Sunday . .  Applicants will be ranked according to the evidence provided . . by the priest . .</li> <li>Within each level of attendance (ie weekly, fortnightly, etc) the following tie breakers will apply:</li> </ol>  <p>A: A boy with a brother on roll . .<br /> B: A boy attending one of the following 7 Catholic primary schools in the Kingston or Sutton Deanery . .<br /> C: Distance from the school, . . &#39;<br /> <a href="http://www.kingston.gov.uk/sif_rchallonerforma2011.pdf">www.kingston.gov.uk/sif_rchallonerforma2011.pdf</a></p>  <p>The minutes of the July 21 council cabinet meeting that decided to buy the site are at: <a href="http://cabnet.richmond.gov.uk/mgConvert2PDF.aspx?ID=2778&amp;T=1">cabnet.richmond.gov.uk/mgConvert2PDF.aspx?ID=2778&amp;T=1</a></p>  <p>There is a lot of further detail in the 52 comments to this RTT story about the petition (which now has 750+ signatures) : <a href="http://tinyurl.com/3wk7gs3">tinyurl.com/3wk7gs3</a></p>  <p>This is not about the merits or not of religious education: it is about what to do with this site, in a borough that needs to open two new community schools open to all by 2015 to keep up with rising numbers. No other sites for new schools have been found, or even suggested.</p>

    <p>This is the case in favour, such as it is:</p>  <p>Cabinet meeting Jul 21: &#39; . . Lord True [Leader] . . assured those present that the Council respected diversity and saw a Catholic school as a way of achieving this not undermining it. The Cabinet Member for Schools [Cllr Paul Hodgins] also reiterated this point. He agreed that another secondary school would be needed but that this was part of the plan and a site was actively being sought. He also addressed the following points:</p>  <ul> <li>That it was for the diocese to make an application to the Secretary of State [to waive competition] in order to create a faith school and this was acknowledged within the report before Cabinet;</li> <li>That the time was right to create a new school in Richmond and other ways of increasing capacity would continue to be investigated;</li> <li>He would strive to increase school places and the desirability of the places currently available.</li> </ul>  <p>The Deputy Leader and Cabinet Member for Finance and Resources [Cllr G Samuel] addressed those present. He reported that in April after a debate in full council brought about by the presentation of a petition in favour of a Catholic School, there was cross party support for the principle of a Catholic School; including a speech in favour by the Shadow Cabinet Member for Education. He argued that after a show of support with no objections it would be hypocritical for Cabinet not to act when a suitable site presented itself. He assured those who had made representations that he respected the argument that education should be secular but he felt that diversity was encouraged by the creation of faith schools, not threatened . .</p>  <p>Councillor True spoke to those present about the council&#39;s intentions. He said that Cabinet heard and respected the arguments involved and was committed to increasing school places and that this would include the provision of a Catholic Secondary School. It was true that the Diocese must make representation to the Secretary of State to waive competition on the creation of a Faith School and the council would support them in this process. . . &#39;</p>  <p>Full minutes: <a href="http://twickenhamlibdems.co.uk/en/article/2011/507289/purchase-of-clifden-road-site-site-for-the-provision-of-school-places-council-minute-july-21">twickenhamlibdems.co.uk/en/article/2011/507289/purchase-of-clifden-road-site-site-for-the-provision-of-school-places-council-minute-july-21</a></p>

    <p>Update October 06: the church has made a formal application to Michael Gove, Secretary of State for Education, for consent to "publish proposals" for a Voluntary Aided school on the Clifden Road site. This is required to avoid the Council having to hold a competition for the new school, or having to set it up as an Academy (which would have a maximum 50 % faith-based admissions). His decision is a closed process and we don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening. See: <a href="http://twickenhamlibdems.co.uk/en/article/2011/512963/the-new-school-for-twickenham-what-happens-next">twickenhamlibdems.co.uk/en/article/2011/512963/the-new-school-for-twickenham-what-happens-next</a> for more detail.</p>  <p>Gove will not respond to letters from the public but he will to a letter from an MP on their behalf. So if you object to the church&#39;s application and live in the Twickenham constituency, please write to Vince Cable [ <a href="mailto:%63%61%62%6C%65%76%40%70%61%72%6C%69%61%6D%65%6E%74%2E%75%6B">cablev@parliament.uk</a> or by letter to: 2a Lion Road,Twickenham TW1 4JQ] copying  <a href="mailto:%6D%69%6E%69%73%74%65%72%73%40%65%64%75%63%61%74%69%6F%6E%2E%67%73%69%2E%67%6F%76%2E%75%6B">ministers@education.gsi.gov.uk</a> . A letter is better, if you can make the time to write it.</p>
