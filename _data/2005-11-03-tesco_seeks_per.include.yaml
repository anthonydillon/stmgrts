    <p>I thought Tesco did not have planning permission for the ATM they have already put in and yet the Post Office were refused permission to put one in. Why don&#39;t the Post Office apply again for a second ATM?</p>

    <p>Honestly, it&#39;s not a good idea to put an ATM outside. Why don&#39;t they ask to put one inside? Do they realize just how much danger they are putting residents in of robbery?</p>

    <p>The issue is not about making a difference to anyones life it is about the blatant misuse of rules and regulation sthat we as ordinary residents have to follow when dealing with the council but Tesco seeem to get away with it regularly. Perhaps we should also look at brown bags to help!!</p>

    <p>If there is another one it should be at the post office. It would create less obstruction and some competition.</p>

    <p>Yet more thrown-away receipts littering the bus stop, along with Tesco bills and sweet papers. Don&#39;t Tesco own a broom? I think their profits could run to one.</p>

    <p>Tesco should not be allowed another ATM. In fact I think they should be required to move the existing one inside. Their signage, their shopfront  and the outside ATM are all designed to elicit &#39;passing car trade.&#39; This is a local high street with limited parking facilities; Tesco and Superdrug have made it a strip mall --but without the parking facilities. I have never passed this site without seeing illegal and/or dangerous parking/driving - as passing motorists zoom in to get money or shopping. Relying so heavily on passing car trade also makes the area much more anonymous -- which can(and I would like somone to monitor this to see if it has) make it less safe and clean.</p>

    <p>I think Tesco should have another ATM Machine, and it should be put inside the shop. There is so much wasted space by the front inside the shop so there is room. Also by doing this it would prevent people from installing these fake fronts to the ATM&#39;s, reduce the litter from ATM&#39;s and make their customes feel more safe withdrawing cash. But Tesco should only do this if they genuinly care about their customers and not their profits, so lets see.......</p>
