    <p>Well done Judy on not letting the grass grow. I hope the meeting is well attended. It is important also for the online dialogue to continue, as a meeting is too short to cover all the issues and allow all voices to be heard. So I hope people will keep writing in here.</p>  <p>Perhaps if the forums section gets better used then the discussions can be tied into themes. I am happy to kick off one on the CPZ issue with a for and against argument - perhaps Nigel Cannings could do the same for the Tesco problem and Simon Chapman on the thirty minute free parking.</p>
