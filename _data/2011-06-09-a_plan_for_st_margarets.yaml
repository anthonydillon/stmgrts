    <blockquote><p>"...although the council is keen to explore new ideas and help traders associations across the borough the councils licencing department are concerned that recent European legislation under the EU Services Directive might make it difficult for a licence to be granted."</p></blockquote>  <p>Oh for goodness sake, it&#39;s a directive not a law, please just ignore it like the French do and get on with it?</p>

    <p>I agree Ed!</p>  <p>Seem like the Council should be supporting the traders and helping them find a way to do this... not stop them.</p>

    <p>And another thing, the clue is in the name: "EU Services Directive" - it applies to cross-border supplies of SERVICES not GOODS.  Rather irrelevant to setting up a fishmonger&#39;s stall opposite the butcher&#39;s.<br /> Perhaps someone in the licensing department had recently been on a course and got a bit carried away!</p>

    <p>I really look forward to a bakery and fishmonger in St M. The more control the locals have over the area, the better.</p>

    <p>Update 16/06/11</p>  <p>The council&#39;s newly appointed Business and Retail Champion - Susan Shaw has visited St Margarets to view the proposed sites for the market stalls and to discuss the proposal. Susan has also arranged meetings with those concerned at the council to hopefully help take things forward.</p>
