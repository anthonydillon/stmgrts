    <p>Hi Martyn. Fascinating stuff. Have the read the Who diaries book called Anyway anyhow anywhere. On page 85 your gig is mentioned, but not the band. You should get in touch with the authors and get the Trekkers assigned to the history books as well. My fav Keith Moon story is from a friend of mine&#39;s dad (who is David Lane of Thunderbirds fame). He was knocked over in the car park by a Rolls Royce and out steps Keith dressed as Hitler. It was about 2 in the afternoon and just another day for Keith. He was so apologetic to David but David insisted it was a privilege to by run over by such a megalith of a man</p>
