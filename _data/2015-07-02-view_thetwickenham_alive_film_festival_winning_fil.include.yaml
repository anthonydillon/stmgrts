    <p>On a hot summers evening on EEl Pie Island this was a really inspiring Twickenham event which confirms Twickenham is still the hot bed of creative talent it has always been. My husband and I went along to see the animated film created by Alban Low about the long running Twickenham Jazz Club, where Alban regularly sits drawing the musicians. As Albans&#39; brillaint short film was being shown early we had thought that we would make an early exit but were so enthralled by the other entries that we stayed for a full showing.                                                          Congratulations to everyone who contributed their Films and Twickenham Live. This is an event that more creative film makers should engage in..and is a great night out..</p>
