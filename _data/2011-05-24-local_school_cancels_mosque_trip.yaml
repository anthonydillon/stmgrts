    <p>I think that infant school children are far too young to be studying major faiths and that the trip to the Mosque would have been a totally wasted experience anyway.</p>

    <p>I agree with Eunice children in year 1 should not be burdened with studying major faiths, except to celebrate different festivals in the general sense. they are much too young. They would do better learning how to be kind and to show respect for each other.</p>
