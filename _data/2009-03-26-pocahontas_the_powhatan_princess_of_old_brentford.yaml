    <p>My late sister lived at Downs close and told me that Charles Dickens had ties with the house, and in fact wrote part of his novels there. could any body confirm this. I have visited James town in Virginia and the whole area is very much English and it was great to be asscosiated with the history comming from Twickenham. In Willamsburgh there is a house that reminded me of York house in Twickenham.</p>

    <p>In June 1838 Charles Dickens, his wife Kate and their two young children came to stay at 4 Ailsa Park Villas which is adjacent to Downes Close. During the two months that they spent in St. Margarets Dickens was very busy writing monthly episodes of "Oliver Twist" and also working on "Nicholas Nickelby" which was serialised later that year.<br /> I believe that 4 Ailsa Park Villas still stands although its number has changed to 2. I am actually researching this story so if there is any change to this info. I&#39;ll let you know.</p>
