    <p>Quite a good web site for reporting any defect to any council - is <a href="http://www.fixmystreet.com/">www.fixmystreet.com</a></p>  <p>(I came across it at the top-level "Government portal" - so it can be considered to be officially sanctioned).</p>  <p>It&#39;s quite clunky in some respects, but no more so than the local council&#39;s own site.  The advantage is that there&#39;s a map where you stick a "pin" to show the exact location of the problem, attach a photo, and you can later add updates.</p>  <p>They email the report direct to the appropriate council on your behalf, so it pays to be as specific as possible in your description.</p>  <p>There&#39;s also an interesting league table of councils with number of defects outstanding against each.</p>  <p>The main exception for which it doesn&#39;t work is reporting of defects on "red route" roads such as the A316, for which one must visit TFL at<br /> <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/roadusers/reportastreetfault/934.aspx">www.tfl.gov.uk/roadusers/reportastreetfault/934.aspx</a></p>  <p>Ed</p>
