    <p>6 &#189; hours guaranteed, no night flights say  LHR ?  Flights are still arriving regularly past 11.30 pm at night and arrivals every morning begin at 4.30 am ( apparently it is the flight from Hong Kong, and it has to arrive in the UK  at this early time so that the residents of Hong Kong are not disturbed from their rest when the flight for the UK departs ! ) LHR word not to be trusted !!</p>
