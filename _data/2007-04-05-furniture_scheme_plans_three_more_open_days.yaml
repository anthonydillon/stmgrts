    <p>I&#39;ve used the furniture scheme in the past and consider it an excellent way to dispose of unwanted furtniture.  However some things they don&#39;t want - and in these cases there is an excellent alternative which is quick and easy - Freecycle.  Simply advertise your unwanted item on one of the local Freecycle groups and chances are you will find someone who can make use of it!</p>  <p>There are Freecycle groups for Richmond, Kingston and Hounslow, join the Richmond one at:</p>  <p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/richmonduponthamesfreecycle/">groups.yahoo.com/group/richmonduponthamesfreecycle</a></p>  <p>Alternatively visit the Freecycle index and "drill down" to find the group of your choice at:</p>  <p><a href="http://uk.freecycle.org/">uk.freecycle.org</a></p>
