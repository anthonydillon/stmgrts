    <p>Start with the supermarkets.  They are the ones who incorporate excessive packaging in to their products, and give away free plastic carrier bags at every opportunity.  Apparently this is down to consumer demand.</p>  <p>A trip across the channel will reveal that French supermarkets are back where ours were in the 1970&#39;s, having abandoned plastic bags altogether several years ago.  For the past several years you have had to bring your own or re-cycle one of the cardboard boxes near the entrance.</p>

    <p>Yes supermarkets good point.  I was in Waitrose Kingston last week and asked for a paper bag to be met with a blank stare.  When I suggested I use a box instead I was told "all boxes are broken down and taken away, can&#39;t you use a plastic bag we have loads of those". Maddie</p>
