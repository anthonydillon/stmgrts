    <p>My great aunt died at 30 Twickenham Road Isleworth in March 1942. If you look on Google Maps (which is notoriously inaccurate as borne out by the recent Nicaragua/Costa Rica near war) it&#39;s a suburban house, but I reckon it was an Infirmary at the time, situated in the angle formed by Twickenham Road and Park Road. Can anyone confirm this? Thanks, Hazel</p>

    <p>I too had trouble finding out what happened at 30 Twickenham Rd.</p>  <p>Was it a hospital or a rather shady private nursing home for those who wanted very discreet births? In the end I discovered that it was part of what is now West Middlesex Hospital. There were a number of units on the site including a maternity unit (my own wife was born there in 1954) and a large surgical ward. Many wounded from the 1<sup>st</sup> world war were treated there and some are buried in the cemetery to the rear.</p>  <p>Isleworth Hospital still exists as a maternity unit part of the West Mid.</p>
