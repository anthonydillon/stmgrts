    <p>A good turnout at Twickenham allowed a team to go to Ranelagh Drive, St Mags, instead and make a good start on clearing the river bed between the lock and the houseboats. The rubbish is piled up on the pavement by the steps and between the road and river bridges waiting for the Council to collect it.</p>  <p>This clean-up is organised by Patrick Kidner, who lives in E Twickenham, to whom our thanks are due.</p>
