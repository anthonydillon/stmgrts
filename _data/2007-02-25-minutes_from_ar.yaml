    <p>CPZ Consultation?  Currently happening?  Or has it been and gone and I&#39;ve missed it?  I can find nothing about it on the richmond.gov.uk website, and I searched long and hard.</p>  <p>If the boundary is the river, the Borough boundary, the A316 and Cole Park Road then that could be construed to include Cassilis and Heathcote roads, which have been blessed with no parking problems and no CPZ tax for the ten years I&#39;ve lived here...</p>  <p>Consultation exercise:  If you&#39;re listening (which I sincerely doubt) -  CPZ not wanted here!</p>

    <p>I was one of the 8 members of the public present at this meeting which took place no less than 4 months ago.  I too have not been seen the survey that was to be available in the early part of 2007.  What we need is a current status report prior to the meeting to be held on the 16 April.</p>

    <p>Consultation should start around mid April. Area to be consulted will be the whole of St Margarets not previously covered by a CPZ going up to the ward boundary and all who may be effected will have their say.<br /> We are currently trying to set up a "working group" to include local residents,(I have put some names forward), councillors and council officers, this should prove usefull in the lead up to the consultation and beyond.</p>  <p>Cllr Ben Khosa</p>

    <p>According to a council survey, mentioned in a current planning report, there are over 70 car parking spaces available in St Margarets within walking distance of Tesco&#39;s in the evening.  I wish I could find just one of them some evenings.<br /> I wonder who&#39;s living in the real world, the residents paying their council tax, or the council officials receiving our council tax in their salaries.</p>

    <p>Anyone living in the area knows that if you arrive home after about 6.00 pm there is no chance of finding a parking space. So I am not sure where or how the council are conjuring up these 70 spaces from.</p>  <p>Another extremely worrying and dangerous trend is the number of motorists who turn into Broadway Ave look for a space at the top and not finding one turn round and drive the wrong way up the one way system. This now happens on a daily basis. An accident seems almost inevitable as cars turning into the one way system are not expecting to meet anyone coming the other way.</p>

    <p>I certainly hope the survey will also look at, or guess the impact of changing demographics of the area.  On my street we have had a large number of elderly residents with no cars selling to families with two.</p>

    <p>Along with other councillors I have been looking at the concept of car clubs. Whilst it may not be a magic wand, I believe St Margarets is just the type of area to derive most benefit from it. Since this is an area where conditions are getting to the point of desperation we should use every tool available to us.</p>  <p>Figures show it cuts down the number of cars in an area also cuts down the number of miles driven and Wow ... people save money.</p>  <p>With modern technology, usage is made so simple that in other Boroughs people are known to have got rid of their car and find it convenient enough to use such clubs for their casual trip to the supermarket</p>  <p>Cllr Ben Khosa</p>

    <p>I think Ed should bear in mind that Casillis Road and Heathcote Road should be consulted as there is an inevitable knock-on effect. During the day; Broadway Avenue empty, Winchester Road full.</p>

    <p>All roads in St Margarets not in a CPZ up to the ward boundaries will be consulted.</p>  <p>So Casillis and Heathcote Rd fall in this catagory and will be consulted.</p>  <p>Cllr Ben Khosa</p>
