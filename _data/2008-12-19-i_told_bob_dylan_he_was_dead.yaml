    <p>I&#39;m not so sorry to burst it though. because Dylan has been switched. You talked to a double, who never knew he was one. He does believe he&#39;s Dylan. So, of course, he would think you&#39;re crazy. Trust your heart and forget "proof", though its there if you&#39;re really so narrow to need it.</p>  <p>R.I.P. Bob You shone like no other...</p>
