    <p>What an absolute disaster!!  I hope Kim and her merry gang of friends are happy.  Residents left in the non cpz roads will have more chance of watching a pig fly then finding a space. Enjoy!!!</p>

    <p>Michael, King Canute, Kim and her merry gang of friends will probably take no pleasure from the fact that you now inherit what they had to contend with. At the same time they should not feel to sorry for forthcoming plight. You and your now not so merry gang had been given the opportunity to join but choose not to do so.</p>  <p>Coming to think of it, many in your gang actively wanted the council to use a different consultation process (not street by street but a large enough area to ensure that the NO vote will dominate, thus dis enfranchising streets with a daytime parking problem.)</p>

    <p>This is a sensible modest extension of the CPZ to include the two roads which only narrowly voted not to be in it when it was set up.</p>  <p>The ward councillors, having delivered on their election promises, [1] to get a CPZ consultation and [2] no road will be forced into the CPZ, must be mightily relieved that it is done and dusted; I imagine it will be many years before anyone will wish to repeat it!</p>
