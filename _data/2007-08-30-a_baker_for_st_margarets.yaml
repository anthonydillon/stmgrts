    <p>Their local branches are listed at: <a href="http://www.lamandine.co.uk/">www.lamandine.co.uk/</a> The nearest are at: 7 Golden Court, Richmond and 48 Friar Stile Road, Richmond Hill. The branch in teddington is a &#39;Wi-Fi hotspot&#39; which may appeal to some.</p>

    <p>Nick Jones letter has also been posted as general comment in support of the planning application for change of use from retail to housing for the 50% of the retail premises that were not offered to let as the new lease holder says that part of the retail premises is SURPLUS TO HIS REQUIREMENTS.</p>  <p>Lets not forget, apart from local interest issues such as health and safety as well as other regulations may well result in the prospective tenant pulling out at the end of the 6 weeks Nick Jones is suggesting it will take to sort out legal issues. In the mean time the sign in the shop window still says shop to let.</p>

    <p>Don&#39;t believe that L&#39;Amandine is a bakery; think its just another caf&#233;. If it actually were a proper bakery producing interesting bread on the premises then that would be great...but another caf&#233;?  Think we already have at least 7 in central St. Margaret&#39;s..</p>

    <p>Sunshine and Ravioli hasn&#39;t been up to much since the old management left, so with reservations I welcome L&#39;Amandine. Maybe S&amp;R should pack in the caf&#233; and sell bread and cakes to take away? I hope, incidentally, that the new place doesn&#39;t damage the fine little coffee kiosk by the A316.</p>

    <p>L&#39;Amandine on Richmond Hill do sell bread, but the other outlets don&#39;t.  I agree Paul would be preferable. I remember a conversation with a local restaurant at the time of Kobler&#39;s demise that their offering was missing a trick given its location in the centre of St. Margarets and Paul would fit perfectly to my mind.  Could either franchise cope with the kids&#39; demand for sticky buns at 3.30 every day?</p>  <p>Wholeheratedly endorse Rog comments about S &amp; R as well as the kiosk.  However, S &amp; R is a good overflow for those who find Zorans a bit noisy.</p>

    <p>Paul is lovely, but I would prefer somewhere that sells good bread that one can actually afford to eat every day.</p>

    <p>Anybody know what&#39;s happening now? Is Amandine coming? Kobler&#39;s is at the moment a boarded-up eyesore joining this owners other boarded-up eyesores further along St Margarets Road. Her eyesore at the corner of Talbot Road is particularly repellent.</p>
