    <p>The idea that the film studios are going to be loss making is simply not true! In recent years poor management has led to the current crisis but there are lots of productions that still wish to use these facilities as they are among the best in the country. The addition of green screens would also generate a lot of income. If these studios were properly run they would certainly return a reasonable if not a healthy profit especially with all the positive publicity it has received lately.  More housing in an already overstretched area we certainly don&#39;t need!!!!</p>
