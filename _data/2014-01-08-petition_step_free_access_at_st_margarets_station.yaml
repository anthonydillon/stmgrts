    <p>Where exactly do the petitioners envisage that this step-free access would be installed and in what form? No doubt they have thought it through fully.</p>

    <p>I agree that it doesn&#39;t look easy.  I can&#39;t speak for Paul Nicoll, but one possible solution could be &#39;incline&#39; lifts.  These are designed to fit inside existing stair wells, and are in use in some parts of Europe.  In fact both canopies at the station are in a pretty poor state, and have passed their sell by date for yet another refurbishment and coat of paint.  I&#39;ve signed Paul&#39;s petition because I think he has a valid point as it&#39;s not only buggies but also wheelchairs, and even though an immediate solution might not look obvious to me, it shouldn&#39;t stop us making Network Rail aware of any local concerns.</p>

    <p>Well on the Twickenham-bound side they could just open the side-gate - simple.</p>

    <p>Once at Twickenham, you can easily change to a fast train going the other way, step free.<br /> All sorted, for the cost of installing an oyster-reader by the side gate.</p>

    <p>I agree Ed that does seem the obvious most cost effective solution.  I believe that&#39;s been suggested to Network Rail by the previous station master responsible for St Margarets Station.  Apparently they came back with various &#39;health &amp; safety&#39; reasons why they couldn&#39;t do that, even if it was purely totally open access without any form of mechanical barrier that could go wrong.  That does seem ludicrous as it&#39;s already a totally open access station.</p>

    <p>The campaign to get that side gate open again - it was opened in the morning and locked up at night when I first came here - went on for years but got nowhere. It seems the obvious move now, solving at least half the problem - but it&#39;s crazy that they didn&#39;t do it along with the platform lengthening work a few inches away</p>
