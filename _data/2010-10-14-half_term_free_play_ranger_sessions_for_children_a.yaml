    <p>My boys went and took three of their friends.  Only three other boys were there, but what a great time was had by all.  This is exactly the kind of thing I think would make a huge improvement to our children&#39;s lives, re-learning the joy of playing with friends, outdoors.  Something lost from our own childhood by computers, tv and fear of strangers.  I say, we should change this now.</p>  <p>Claire and her team where great and if enough people ask, they might comeback more regularly.</p>
