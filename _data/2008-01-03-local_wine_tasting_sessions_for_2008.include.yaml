    <p>Hi Hazelle</p>  <p>I was looking at St. Margaret&#39;s generally to see if it would be worth trying for a night out and came across your site.</p>  <p>My wife and I would be very interested in attending if you don&#39;t mind a couple of novices from Kingston attending your event.</p>  <p>Could you let me know if that&#39;s ok please?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>  <p>Maurice and Sarah Nesbeth</p>

    <p>Hello Maurice, I am sorry I didn&#39;t reply sooner but I was very busy in the last few days and am only just catching up. Sorry you missed the session on Thursday 17th January but we have another one coming up in February (13th)- tasting New World Wines, further details should appear on this web site shortly. Meanwhile if you email me direct, at  <a href="mailto:Hazelle.jackson@dial.pipex.com">Hazelle.jackson@dial.pipex.com</a>, I will add your names to the email mailing list for the Group. Today St Margarets,tomorrow the world!</p>
