    <p>Perhaps those that have voted yes to moving the site could suggest an alternative position? I&#39;ve racked my brains trying to think of another site but can&#39;t come up with a better position to the current site.</p>

    <p>I cannot think of another site more suitable. .... best leave them where they are presently situated on Council property.</p>

    <p>How about down by the St Margarets Round-about? There&#39;s plenty of space. It would be down to the council to ensure that it&#39;s kept tidy - something that&#39;s not always the case with the current site, hence the Studio&#39;s request to move it?</p>
