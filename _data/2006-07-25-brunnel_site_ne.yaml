    <p>The company name is Octagon. I suggest you meant to write &#39; . . obviously more expensive underground parking.&#39;</p>

    <p>I saw the photos being taken to apose the changes and living next door to the site am objecting strongly to these changes. Lets hope this does not go ahead as aesthetically the changes would be an eye saw!</p>

    <p>The proposals seek to remove one of the only open spaces within this already mediocre development. It will be replaced by car parking.</p>  <p>Octagon are trying to pull a fast one by significantly deviating from the original approval. They are trying to trick our community and if approved will significantly damage the borough for generations with their exceptionally poor design.</p>  <p>Please visit this link and add your objections:</p>  <p><a href="http://www2.richmond.gov.uk/PlanData2/Planning_Summary.aspx?strWeekListType=REC&amp;strWeekList=07%2F07%2F06%2000%3A00%3A00">www2.richmond.gov.uk/PlanData2/Planning_Summary.aspx?strWeekListType=REC&amp;strWeekList=07/07/06%2000:00:00</a></p>

    <p>There were strong material considerations which led to the original planning application being fashion the way it was, including underground parking.<br /> b<br /> There have been over 30 supplimental applications which have diluted the original absolute minmum regard to the conservation policy.</p>  <p>This has included a proposal to retain gates which are clearly a material departure from the whole notion of this development.</p>  <p>Conservation areas are not safe in Richmond Council&#39;s hands.</p>
