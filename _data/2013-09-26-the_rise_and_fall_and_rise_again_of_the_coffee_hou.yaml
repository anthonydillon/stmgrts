    <p>Ah, Martyn Day  once again given opportunity to write about the chip on his shoulder. The ridiculous notion that a business selling paraffin and chisels would open, never mind survive - the high street has changed, get used to it, get over it. As for the number of coffee shops let market forces dictate, the best will prosper, the worst will fail. Harris &amp; Hoole are busy, likely to prosper so what is your gripe? Some hidden agenda? The people of St Margarets are savvy and discerning shoppers and will vote with their wallets. In the meantime Mr Day how about moving on?</p>

    <p>H&amp;H may be busy, but has anyone else noticed that all the customers in there look like smug clones of each other and I don&#39;t recognise a single one of them. Are they shipped in from somewhere else to get the place off the ground (no pun intended)?</p>

    <p>Interesting that in the same bulletin that Simon Chapman gets recognised for his unflagging service to the St.Margarets community, that Martyn Day gets a bashing for some oblique comments about a Tesco financed coffee chain.  What service or roots does Tesco provide or have in the St.Margarets community?  As for H &amp; H&#39;s customer base, I don&#39;t recognise them either.<br /> Meanwhile I was relieved for the police objection that forced the withdrawal of their licence application.</p>

    <p>Exactly Ben, my thoughts too re Martyn, &#39;We love you and we love these pieces&#39;. You make the effort more than most and we appreciate it.</p>  <p>Dave you may have some personal thoughts re &#39;a chip on the shoulder&#39; and if that is so they should stay &#39;personal&#39; and not berate someone on our &#39;community&#39; website.</p>

    <p>Dave (the mean one) do you really want St Margarets to become more like... let&#39;s say Richmond, officially the least unique high-street in the country with practically no independant shops - only chains?  I certainly do not.  I think Martyn and Simon both have worked hard to keep St Margarets shop&#39;s vibrant, well balanced and largely independent.  And key to that working is people to support it.</p>

    <p>Dave, Cutters on Crown Road sell chisels and paraffin and they&#39;re doing fine.</p>
