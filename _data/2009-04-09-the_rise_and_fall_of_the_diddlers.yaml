    <p>I believe the Driver of the first Diddler on maiden run was George Crowhurst. The Conductor on the Second of the two Diddlers that epic day was my father Edward Fredrick Wallis. He spent his entire working life working for London Transport ended his career as the head of Training at Chiswick. Trolley Buses were part of my growing up.</p>
