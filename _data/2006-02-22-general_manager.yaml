    <p>We will be sorry to see Oisin leave, he has really changed the St Margarets Tavern for the better, and he has been an important contributor to the St Margarets Fair running the Beer Tent. We wish him well in his new job.</p>

    <p>It&#39;s a real shame to see Oisin leave.  The new guys have a massive challange to compete with the standards set, and already seem to be failing  - perhaps more staff will turn up eventually to serve beers so we won&#39;t have to wait 30 minutes for an ale.</p>

    <p>This is not a pub, it is a drinking and feeding station run by accountants.<br /> Food is dreadful, drinks overpriced and atmosphere non existent.<br /> A tragic destruction of a once great pub.</p>
