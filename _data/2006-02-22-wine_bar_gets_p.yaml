    <p>New council policy on &#39;cumulative impact&#39; means that it is extremely difficult to open a bar or pub in Richmond or Twickenham town centres. To do this you must be able to show that your bar will not add to the oveall effect of licensed premises in the area.</p>  <p>St Margarets is outside the &#39;cumulative impact&#39; zone, and so not subject to these restrictions and so is ideal for a new bar.</p>
