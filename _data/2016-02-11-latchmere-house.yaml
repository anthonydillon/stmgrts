    <p>Thanks for clarifying that the &#39;doodlebugs&#39; (V1 flying bombs) were mostly &#39;falling short&#39;; this explains why E. Chapman (in the BBC prog Agent Zigzag) said he reported back to the Nazis that one landed on Regents Park. B. Macintyre (author of a book on Chapman/Zigzag and presenter of the TV programme) claimed that they - Eddie C. and his MI5 handlers - were reporting back that the V1s were over-shooting to eg. Heathrow. Typical BBC: economical with the truth for their &#39;idiot box&#39; (TV) &#39;edutainment&#39;.</p>
