    <p>I&#39;ve just come back from the opening bash: the decor, ambience, the beer, the food and the crowd all impressed me favourably. The Aleksander looks set to become a valuable addition to the East Twickenham scene.</p>  <p>No website as yet, I think.</p>

    <p>We went for a family lunch on Sunday. It was absolute chaos and we spent ages waiting and when the food came it was wrong. Subsequent to this awful experience- we have all been ill- vomiting and diarrhea plus one of our party is pregnant. Needless to say none of us have been to work for the last two days. I would NOT recommend this pub and I will never go back there again.</p>

    <p>The place is looking fantastic, an amazing change.  Having eaten there several times I have always been impressed by the quality of the food and service, even during the refit.</p>  <p>It is clear that Roger and Magdelena have a vision and passion for what they do and warmer welcome you couldn&#39;t find.  I look forward to seeing the Aleksander go from strength to strength, which it is surely bound to do!</p>

    <p>Having worked closely with Roger and Magda for the last few months, it was great to see the Aleksander (formally Marble Hill)in all it&#39;s glory. They have worked so hard to get the pub ready and it looks superb, all credit to them.</p>  <p>The food and ales sampled at the opening party were exceptional, as was the service. You will not find better hosts (or a better selection of beer) in the area. I wish R&amp;M all the best with the pub and will see them again soon - table for 20 before the rugby!!</p>

    <p>The Aleksander is fantastic! From what I hear this could have been a local supermarket so thank God for Roger and Magda saving the community and other local business&#39;s. The service is exceptional and the atmosphere is so warm and friendly. I cannot wait to try the wood fired pizza&#39;s! This is a fantastic local at the heart of the community. People like Robert Smithson should understand that it has only been a few weeks and whilst undergoing extensive renovation they have left the doors open so they could get a chance to meet with the local community.<br /> Please do not go back again, it&#39;s people like you that post negative comments on website&#39;s like this they could do without! It was chaos because it was busy and I wonder if it crossed your mind that there is a bug going around? Please do NOT come back. Best of luck to Roger and Magda, &#39;most&#39; of the local community are right behind you!</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, I did not have a positive experience like those who came to the opening party. On Sunday I went in for a drink and my cardigan got covered in gloss paint as I left the toilet as the door was wet. Also, the toilet floor was covered in toilet paper as there was no way to dry hands. Behind the bar I saw bar staff rubbing glasses with dirty cloths, that&#39;s why we ordered hot drinks. My little girl also was covered in paint from the doors to the outside. We also got paint on our shoes. We were going to also to eat but we went to a properly run pub instead. Pub should not have been open as it was not ready- I don&#39;t care about a family run pub Roger and Madga are money grabbers.</p>

    <p>I had a great time at The Aleksander&#39;s opening night.  Good luck to the owners.  The FREE food and FREE drinks event obviously by-passed you, Penelope Curtis, given your thoroughly unpleasant accusation.</p>
