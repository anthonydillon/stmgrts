    <p>Does anyone know if it would be a machine which charges, or is free? It looks much like the design of machines which do levy a charge. A second machine at the Post Office would more likely be free, if the postmaster could be encouraged to reapply.</p>

    <p>Ian, we do need another cash machine in St. Margarets. The one at Tesco is not sufficient to cover the needs of the area. Too often the machine empty and out of order, this usually happens at weekends and bank holidays (when the post office is closed).</p>

    <p>The pharmacy is open even less than the post office, in my experience.</p>

    <p>Trevor, A cash machine outside would be open 24/7. So what difference does your comment make. Stop trying to put everything down.</p>

    <p>This appears to be a fee-charging ATM sponsored by a private company (Cardpoint plc) not a Bank or Building society.</p>  <p>They claim that there is parking directly outside the premises - is that correct?  or is it a single yellow line restriction?  Crown Road can be quite difficult to negotiate when cars are parked on both sides of the road.</p>

    <p>Ed, take a walk down Crown Road and you will see that there are pay and display parking bays outside the chemist, take a walk to &#39;the other cash machine&#39; and you will see no parking bays just a bus stop. A bus stop that people use as a car park to use the ATM at tesco.</p>

    <p>I fail to see why we need another one of these highway robbery devices in St Margarets. There is one a few paces away at Tescos. The machine will invite more crime to the area and the bollards on the pavement will impede free movement of pedestrians and vehicles.</p>
