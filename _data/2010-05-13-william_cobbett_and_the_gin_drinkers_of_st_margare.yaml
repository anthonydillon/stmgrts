    <p>Today&#39;s undistinguished Gordon House was built long after Cobbett&#39;s day, I believe, on part of the originally very extensive Twickenham Park Estate. More like what he saw is the very fine Ryde House, by Richmond Bridge, built in 1830, the Italianate Willoughby next to it (1835), and Bute Lodge (1835) and Park Lodge (1828) in Park Road.</p>  <p>There is a fine picture of Twickenham Park House (1820) which stood halfway down Park House Gardens at: <a href="http://www.twickenhampark.co.uk/briefhistory.htm">www.twickenhampark.co.uk/briefhistory.htm</a></p>  <p>The riverside was at at that time in the hands of big estates so the  &#39;showy, tea-garden-like boxes&#39; were scattered across the countryside behind them, wherever the nouveaux riches could acquire building plots. They would not have been built to last and none, I think, have survived.</p>

    <p>There does seem to be some confusion about Gordon House. G.E Bate, the author of "And So Make a City Here", a history of Middlesex, says that the building was once known as Seaton House and home to Lord James Hay, the 17th Earl of Erroll. As he lived between 1772 and 1819, and Cobbett made his journey in 1822, there is a strong possibility that amongst the houses commented upon was Gordon House, albeit known at the time as Seaton House.<br /> Bate suggests that the name only changed in the 1840&#39;s when it was occupied by Lord and Lady Frederick Gordon.</p>

    <p>The council report on Conservation area 19: St Margarets Estate states that Gordon House &#39;dates from 1720&#39;.</p>  <p>However, Pevsner states that it is &#39;early Victorian Italianate&#39;, which seems correct to me; I think it must be built round a core of the 1720 mansion. It is listed Grade 2* and in March 2007 was being refurbished for sale as a single property:</p>  <p><a href="http://property.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/property/buying_and_selling/article1457225.ece">property.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/property/buying_and_selling/article1457225.ece</a></p>  <p>There is no word on the web or anywhere else about its having been sold. Octagon themselves describe it as &#39;a Victorian Gothic 12,000 sq ft mansion&#39;, a surprisingly ignorant remark.</p>

    <p>If Cobbett came over Richmond Bridge on his way to Chertsey, it is more likely that he would have turned left past Cambridge Park and the Twining house at Twickenham which would have had &#39;tea box&#39; associations. As his trip was in 1822, even had he turned right, he would not have seen houses built in the late 1820s and 1830s. The most he would have seen of what was to became St Margarets was the end of Crown Road opposite The Crown where he may have caught a glimpse of the house which Turner built in an area which he found attractive enough to live in.</p>
