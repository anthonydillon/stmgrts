    <p>I wholeheartedly agree with Mr Jacobs.  At around 10 am yesterday I did eventually find a space on the 7<sup>th</sup> floor.  It must be quite difficult to actually get in early morning with the queue of commuters.</p>  <p>Cllr. Trigg will no doubt trot out a robust vindication of his parking policy with lots of reasons why a second car park cannot be built - and I don&#39;t mean one that is part of some other scheme. For example, I assume the Riverside residents will get priority if that is ever completed.</p>  <p>But what really annoys me is the new payment machine.  Why does it take so long?  Why does it sometimes take several attempts for it to accept my ticket before I can put the coins in?  Why is there a queue of people when there never was before?  What was wrong with the old one anyway?  Go to Richmond and see how Waitrose get it right!</p>
