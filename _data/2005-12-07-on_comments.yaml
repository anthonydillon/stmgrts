    <p>Sir,</p>  <p>Thank you for posting the comments which were sent to you on an anonymous basis. The comment regarding Tesco does not seem to appear.</p>  <p>This writing is intended for you, Sir, to support my anonymous posting.</p>  <p>Hopefully, you considered the postings to be helpful in the Community&#39;s debate about the particular topics.</p>  <p>The hurdle to writing a name to a posting is the rules and regulations which are imposed on me in my workplace. I have to comply with those or I will be out of work or with reduced income prospects. St. Margarets has a family friendly community which is rare in London in general. Living in St. Margarets is expensive so my income is a key consideration.</p>  <p>In my workplace in Central London, the "culture" is corporate. It could be called "commercial corporate" because it shares no corporate features with the corporate experience of the Church I attend. It seems that the word corporate is adopted to exploit the general understanding of the word and the trust it instills for the purposes of extracting income, rightly earned or unearned, from those paying. If my comments are associated to my role in my workplace it will have a negative impact on my future income or growuth potential.</p>  <p>Having moved in to St. Margarets, I find that colleagues of live in St. Margarets as well. There is the very real possibility of the views finding their way into my workplace nad having a detrimental effect. There have been delaings with tesco for example (not in St. Margarets).</p>  <p>I am not trained as a Politician and cannot claim to have the resources or adequate knowledge to fulfill such a role. So anonymously posting on the St. Margarets website is now the best method for conveying information or views without it having some future negative impact for me.</p>  <p>I don&#39;t know if you know but the IP address of some internet providers changes automatically sometimes due to their system of allocating connections to their customers.</p>  <p>Happy Christmas to you.</p>

    <p>I am aware of the IP issue, but thanks for raising it.</p>  <p>I still wish you would give your real email, as you can see, it is not posted and let&#39;s me as an administrator know that the comments are coming from a real person, agenda or no.</p>
