    <p>Peter Collinson was born in London, in 1693 and kept notes on horticulture in &amp; around London.  From his notes we learn that it was in 1748 that he visited Mr. Vernon &amp; first saw the weeping willow at Twickenham Park, so it could have been brought to England well before that date, it is a common mistake to think that 1748 was the date Vernon acquired the tree, it has been repeated so many times that is is now accepted as &#39;fact&#39; when it is not.</p>

    <p>As far as I can tell the story of Pope finding the twig only surfaced in August 1801 in a newspaper.  If someone has knowledge of an earlier writen account it would be of interest.  So the earlier notes of 1748 re Vernon carry a lot of weight.  Reminds me somewhat of a fig tree growing out from a grave, people claimed the deceased said if there was an afterlife a fig tree would rise from the grave as proof, obviously a post-event fantasy tale.</p>
