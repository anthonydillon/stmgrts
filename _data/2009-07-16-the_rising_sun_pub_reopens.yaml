    <p>I&#39;ve only ever had negative issues with the Rising Sun, so fingers crossed this positive will finally outweigh them!</p>  <p>Looking forward to seeing it all in action</p>

    <p>The pub will be renamed The Marble Hill &#39;from 6 pm&#39; today, Friday August 28.</p>  <p>The old website is defunct and there is no sign of a new one yet; there is a menu outside. I have taken lunch there once and can report that it is definitely a gastropub [i.e. cooked meals cooked to order] and doesn&#39;t do &#39;pub grub&#39;.</p>  <p>The naff decor created by Youngs&#39; refurbishment only a year ago remains unchanged.</p>
