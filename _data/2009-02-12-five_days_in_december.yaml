    <p>Can you confirm where you obtained your figures from re the final death toll of 12,000? I am writing a novel about the Great Smog about my family in Brentford and Richmond at the time and would like to make sure my facts are correct. Most reports put death toll to 4,800. Many thanks. I will put a thank you in the credits.</p>

    <p>I attended the usual childrens church meeting on the Wednesday evening at All Souls Halibuton Road.  Whilst there we were told we had to make for home earlier than usual as the Smog had come down and it was pitch black.  I only lived a little way along the St Margartes Road but I was totally lost, couldn&#39;t see the pavement!</p>
