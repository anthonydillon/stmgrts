    <p>How the G-Wez was fun to drive?  It doesn&#39;t even go over 50!  Not to mention that if you hit anything at any speed, you will die.  That&#39;s because the government doesn&#39;t require safety measures on this "car."  They don&#39;t classify it as a car - they call it a "quadricycle."  Yeah, it&#39;s a slow, useless deathtrap.  Jogging is not only faster, but cheaper as well.  That&#39;s because using your legs is free.</p>

    <p>Who keeps any sort of car these days because driving is "fun"? Speedlimits range from 20 to 40mph. (50 to 60mph on some roads feeding motorway traffic into central London, always terminating in 30mph areas)</p>  <p>Average traffic speed in London is well below the 20mph speedlimit and jogging may well be the answer to those that travel around for "fun".</p>  <p>I have yet to see a jogger carrying a load of shopping home, carrying garden or other recycling material to to council recycling sites ----- The list of incidence were residents use their cars is considerable. However, residents keeping and driving a car just because driving is "fun" must be right at the bottom of that list.</p>  <p>Matt writes "it doesn`t even go over 50" as if 20mph faster than the 30mph legal limit on most urban roads is not fast enough! I suppose smoking tyre wheel spin is also not possible with the G-Wiz, another minus point???</p>
