    <p>I would be interested to hear if schools with playing pitches eg Chase Bridge, Vineyard etc pay extra money to the local authority for the use of their grounds</p>

    <p>Since the schools and parks are all provided for and funded by the council (via <em>OUR</em> taxes, let&#39;s not forget) and provision of sports and exercise is part of the curriculum, this is just robbing Peter to pay Paul.</p>  <p>Council has a duty to make the parks available to schools gratis.  If they are allowed to get away with this, Saturday/Sunday morning football clubs will be the next victims.</p>  <p>And whilst they&#39;re about it, they should provide more bins and clean up all rubbish and dog poo!</p>

    <p>Schools that have dedicated facilities also get a grant from the council and this grant can only be used towards the maintenance costs of their grounds facility.</p>  <p>In the case of St Stephens the charges they pay also go towards the maintenance of the pitches they use.</p>  <p>It does sound like robbing Peter to pay Paul but the reality is the council has to operate within the constraints of any relevant rules and guidlines.</p>  <p>There are pots of money, if you like, set aside for specific purposes and these funds cannot be put to any other use, this is also the problem with some of the &pound;54 mill but that is another story.</p>  <p>Last week Acting Head, local Councillors, School Governor and Council Official had a meeting regarding the above issues. It was noted without exception that the best should be done for the children and they must not suffer any disadvantage. We have already started to put some measures in place and there should be more details today from Cllr Acton who will be present at a meeting with the Cabinet Member for Environment and Head of Parks and open Spaces.</p>  <p>Cllr Ben Khosa</p>
