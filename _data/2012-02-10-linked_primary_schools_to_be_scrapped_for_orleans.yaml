    <p>Whose forecast is that? I understood that the cut-off distance was 1.8 km, and therefore that the LA were expecting all those living above the A316 would be within catchment for Orleans Park.</p>  <p>However, I am disappointed and rather perplexed not to read anything in these Richmond Admissions Forum minutes concerning the good people of North St Margarets.</p>

    <p>The forecast is by &#39;A concerned resident &#39; and I published it as:</p>  <p><a href="http://twickenhamlibdems.co.uk/en/article/2011/523396/abolishing-the-linked-schools-system-who-gains-who-loses-a-forecast-for-orleans-park">twickenhamlibdems.co.uk/en/article/2011/523396/abolishing-the-linked-schools-system-who-gains-who-loses-a-forecast-for-orleans-park</a></p>  <p>on the website of Twickenham Lib Dems.</p>

    <p>So, in other words, unsubstantiated &amp; unattributable scaremongering republished by Lib Dems. Quel surprise.</p>
