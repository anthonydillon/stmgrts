    <p>As a previous resident of St Margarets, and now responsible for Organising the Concerts on behalf of English Heritage, I wanted to clarify a few points you have raised in connection with the Marble Hill concerts licence application.</p>  <p>I am confused by the reference to disturbance caused by heavy support lorries at the concerts. Last year, noise from roadworks on Richmond Road late at night was wrongly attributed to the concerts. We have never received any valid complaints about truck noise from the concerts as truck movements are limited and strictly controlled. We are not proposing doing anything else differently with regards to trucks at the concerts.</p>  <p>The rehearsals/sound check timings are also the same as in previous years. However, it is worth noting that are now not licensable activities under the new licensing law, but we are keen to control them and to apply noise conditions to them, as part of our efforts to minimise noise disturbance to local residents.</p>  <p>With regards to clearing car parks, we have an excellent track record, with Police supporting us, and have them cleared by 11.30pm at the latest. This is no different from previous years.</p>  <p>Litter clearance takes place during, and following the event, and English Heritage are happy with the excellent clear-up which took place at last year&#39;s events. Litter clearup causes no noise disturbance to local residents as it is carried out by hand, and skips are emptied by the council during the day.</p>  <p>The concerts are enjoyed by nearly 20,000 local people, and we work extremely hard, using independent noise consultants to limit disturbance caused to local residents.</p>

    <p>Kevin should stop being such a grumpy-guts and instead be happy that we have such a cool venue with cool events within walking distance of our houses (yes we live nearby too).  What&#39;s wrong with enjoying what&#39;s going on?  If we moan too much, it&#39;ll all dry up -- and where will that get us?</p>

    <p>I think if Simon knew me, which he doesn&#39;t, I don&#39;t think he could justifiably call me a "grumpy guts"! I am glad that we have a  good venue within walking distance of our houses and there&#39;s nothing wrong with enjoying what&#39;s going on! I attend the concerts and enjoy them. What I object to is the possibility that the park will be taken advantage of by IMG - a large corporation - who may well have it in mind to hold as many concerts as possible throughout the year and tempt English Heritage into being part of it all because they receive funding from the proceeds.</p>  <p>I am concerned for people&#39;s safety and enjoyment of a beautiful park with concerts held there but of an appropriate number and size. Simple as that, really.</p>

    <p>Hi Kevin - that was a good answer, thank you.  Perhaps I was a bit grumpy myself in my previous comment - for which apologies - but I just wanted to make sure we weren&#39;t being nimbies.  I agree about the appropriate number and size.</p>
