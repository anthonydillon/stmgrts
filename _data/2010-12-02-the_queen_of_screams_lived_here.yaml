    <p>I worked with Ingrid and her daughter Stephanie in 2003 as the Cameraman on a small british horror film called "The Asylum". It also starred Patrick Mower and Robin Askwith, also 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s stars of the day and Ingrid stole the film. She was a lot of fun on set even though her health was suffering a little then in her 60&#39;s. RIP Ingrid you will be a hard act to follow..</p>
