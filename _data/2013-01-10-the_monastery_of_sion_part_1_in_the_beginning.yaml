    <p>I understood that the original Sion had been founded by Henry V on the understanding that daily prayers were said for the soul of his father Henry IV in purgatory.  This was no doubt an attempt to counter his father&#39;s morally dubious acts of which Henry V was the heir and beneficiary.</p>  <p>Interestingly in this respect, among his father&#39;s greates foes were the Percy family, several of whom died in opposition to him - Thomas Percy being hung drawn and quartered after the battle of Shrewsbury in 1403.</p>  <p>The Percy family would, 150 years later, inherit Sion, in whose posession it remains.</p>
