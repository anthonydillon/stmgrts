    <p>Thanks for this interesting item, to which I add this from the British DNB:</p>  <p>"... In his era and for many years afterward, Haliburton&#39;s humour was widely enjoyed. His use of offensive stereotypes in his caricatures of black people, however, goes well beyond the ethnocentrism of the age, and his portrayal of women is unenlightened.</p>  <p>Thomas Adolphus Trollope recalled &#39;he was large and burly in person, with grey hair, a large ruddy face, a humorous mouth, and bright blue eyes always full of mirth ... a delightful companion -- for a limited time&#39; (What I Remember, 1.359-60). His reputation has never regained the peak it achieved in his lifetime."</p>
