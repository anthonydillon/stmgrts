    <p>How did I miss this?  I walk my dog on Moormead every day, often picking  up shredded "Bags for Life" on a Wednesday after the scavenging foxes on Tuesday night.  I wish there had been something on the notice board.</p>

    <p>David,</p>  <p>I always post them in the events on this site - [this years](<a href="https://stmargarets.london/event/meeting/200705147051">s</a>)</p>  <p>These should appear in the newsletter and on twitter as well.  But I agree with your bigger point.</p>  <p>Peter</p>
