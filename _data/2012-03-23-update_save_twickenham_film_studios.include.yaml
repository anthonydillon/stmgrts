    <p>If the email links above don&#39;t work, use:</p>  <ul> <li> <a href="mailto:Cllr.GActon@richmond.gov.uk">Cllr.GActon@richmond.gov.uk</a></li> <li> <a href="mailto:Cllr.BKhosa@richmond.gov.uk">Cllr.BKhosa@richmond.gov.uk</a></li> <li> <a href="mailto:Cllr.CHarrison@richmond.gov.uk">Cllr.CHarrison@richmond.gov.uk</a></li> </ul>  <p>The site is private property, just as the ice rink was, so it is bound to be the case that what happens on it is mainly decided by the owner rather than by residents in general. The key issue is: &#39;Is anyone else prepared to offer more than Taylor Wimpey have offered?&#39;</p>  <p>The accountant is just doing his job as liquidator, which is to get the best price he can for the assets so that the creditors, who I imagine include local traders as well as HMRC, can be paid what they are owed.</p>

    <p>I met with Vince Cable yesterday (23rd March) on behalf of the Save Twickenham Studios campaign and without going in to too many details, he is being supportive in his role as a local MP.</p>  <p>Are you meeting him in your role as someone involved in preparing a bid for the studios, Maria?</p>  <p>I was advised by Brian Ash QC that the case for negligence was not a promising one and that the most hopeful course of action, should the Taylor Wimpey sale go through and they sit on the land waiting for a change of use to be approved, would be to pressure the council to issue a compulsory purchase order.</p>
