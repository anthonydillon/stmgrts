    <p>Does anyone know exactly when the camera signs went up as I got issued a ticket, however I am convinced the signs were not yet there. Any help would be very well received. Thanks a million! Veronica Goldstein</p>

    <p>Veronica, the offence is independent of the signs. So whether they were there or not will not help you, I think.</p>

    <p>Only in the last couple of days, I think.  Certainly, the one on St Margarets Road that is sort of near the Tesco loading bay only seemed to go up yesterday.</p>  <p>And they look like speed camera signs!</p>  <p>I think that to enforce the tickets the Council has a duty to have posted the signs first, under the Data Protection Act, so it&#39;s probably worth asking officially under the FOI Act when they were posted at the location.</p>  <p>In Westminster when they started this for the first three weeks the council ran an awareness campaign and drivers received a warning, rather than a fine, through the post.</p>  <p>It&#39;s a shame that the council didn&#39;t introduce it slightly more gently.</p>  <p>That said, the parking situation in St Margarets has become stupid, particularly outside Tesco.  The bus stop isn&#39;t a car park, nor is the loading bay, and the double yellows particularly aren&#39;t.  They were put there because the visibility for pedestrians crossing Broadway Avenue is virtually nil if someone parks there, and it&#39;s just dangerous.  This just wasn&#39;t a problem before Tesco.</p>  <p>For those people who actually need to use their cars to shop in St Margarets, there is adequate parking in neighbouring streets or further up the main road most of the time.</p>  <p>It is also incredibly discriminatory to the shops in Crown Road if people are targetted by wardens there (and they really are), and yet they can park with impunity in front of Tecso.</p>

    <p>I am informed the signs were installed on the 14th May with enforcement commencing on 15th May. And they are at the folowing locations. Cllr Acton has requested a further, more prominant sign be placed near Tesco.</p>  <p>The Barons St Margarets Road Crown Road St Margarets Road Bridge Road Amyand Park Road</p>  <p>Cllr Ben Khosa</p>

    <p>I was told today that the dustmen collecting rubbish from Streets received a &pound;40 parking fine and that they will now longer be collecting rubbish from this shop.  Is this true.  It seems ludicrous to me!</p>

    <p>I was issued a ticket on 7<sup>th</sup> June. I requested photographs which appear to come from the cctv camaera although I was told they were from a smart car. The smart car could never have achieved such an angle. The photographs clearly show me picking my son up just after the bus stop. I never parked, the brake lights were on, I was in the car and was there for 40 seconds. They have refused my appeal and I am going to court. For picking my son up! How can this be right when the Tescos lorry causes such an obstruction. I am furious and look forward to the court date.</p>

    <p>Does anyone know if it is possible to get footage from the bus stop from Jan 07? I reversed about a foot and nudged a scooter that was parked in the BUS STOP. I did not knock it over and have recentely been to court for failure to stop (which i did) and leaving an accident (which I wanted to dispute but could not afford to. However, the owner lied on the statement and siad he was not in the bus stop. I got 5 (yes, 5!!!!!!) points for this and fine at court. I want to prove the lying of the owner as he contributed to the event but parking behind my van which was legally parked at 6.30pm when the bay becomes free... The more i think about it the more it becomes clear why... he didn&#39;t want to do a left and go down the one way road as he would have to loop alll the the way back round. Any ideas??</p>

    <p>Richard,</p>  <p>I believe the camera is owned by Transport for London but is used by the Twickenham Police, so you would have to contact either of them.</p>  <p>Sorry I don&#39;t have more details,</p>  <p>Peter</p>

    <p>I got a ticket for waiting initially in the loading bay - by accident, then rolling forward out of it within a matter of seconds, never turned the engine off, passenger back in the car inside of a couple of minutes. Got a ticket notice and have asked for images as I was waiting and the vehicle never unattended. I&#39;d like to know hoe Martyn Henman got on with his ticket as it seems identical to my situation.</p>  <p>If anyone else has any other information I&#39;d be really grateful...</p>

    <p>Just like Dan I receive a ticket through the post for having stopped in the loading bay to take an important phone call.</p>  <p>I disputed it and was sent a reply along with photographic evidence telling me that they think the ticket was issued correctly.</p>  <p>In the photo you can clearly see that my indicators were on notifying drivers that I&#39;d merely pulled up on the left. The engine was still running!</p>  <p>So, to abide by one law of not using a mobile phone whilst driving it seems I got stumped with a fine for "parking" in a loading bay.</p>  <p>Any suggestions what I can do ?</p>

    <p>I have been sent a &pound;100 fine for waiting in my car with the tyres on the kerb in St Margarets.I admit this may be illegal but using CCTV to catch people using local shops or dropping off passengers is petty and about making money.These cameras should be used to catch criminals not shoppers.</p>  <p>I will now oppose all use CCTV from now on.</p>

    <p>I&#39;ve just been searching something online and came back across this file about parking in the the stop outside of Tesco&#39;s and thought I would update the file. About two days before the court case i got a call from the council who played hardball. They said it would go to court if I did not pay and I said fine see you there. I also told them I would invite the press and explain the bullying tactics. I insisted they provide the footage prior to court and they refused but dropped the court case. I never paid a penny. Fight back and you will win if you are in the right. they can not give you a parking ticket for not parking. If you are in the buss stop well so be it, but if you are in your car with the engine on you are not parked. They might wish to prosecute for some other offence but can not prosecute you for parking.....</p>
