    <p>Hallo from Levin, New Zealand!    I was born in Sidney Road in 1936 and my Grandparents lived in Napoleon Road and an Aunt &amp; Uncle in The Avenue.  I receive the St. Margaret&#39;s newsletter and read it with pride and some longing,  for the old area I hold dear to my heart.  I am thrilled Crown Road has it&#39;s shops fully occupied again and congratulate you all on your efforts.   My Grandmother used to queue up for her fish each week with Walter de lar Mare, the Poet!   I often went to visit her on a Saturday and knew where to find Gran if not at home - somewhere at the shops and the greengrocers, bakery, were our favourites to find her!</p>  <p>PLEASE can you e-mail me  with details of the special St. Margaret&#39;s shopping bags and how much they are?   Would be great to have one and so  &#39;compete&#39; with anybody holding a Harrod&#39;s one!!</p>  <p>With very best wishes, Patricia Hammond</p>
