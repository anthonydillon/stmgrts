    <p>Please tell me this will NOT include the A316 - "where appropriate".  Anyway, in many parts of the borough, 20mph would mean an increase in speed. They have introduced this in Isleworth and while I observe the limit, many seem to ignore it. It would need to be backed up by speed cameras with the attendant outcry of "increased street furniture".  Making it really difficult to use rat-runs (Brook Road-Winchester Road-Bridge Road to avoid the St.Margarets roundabout for example) might be a more targeted way.</p>
