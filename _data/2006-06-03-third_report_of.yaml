    <p>Given the persistent problems with this machine and the havoc and danger that it creates by &#39;enticing&#39; motorists passing by to park in the bus stop, on double yellow lines and/or facing traffic.  I would like to suggest again that Tesco put this ATM inside the store where they can take responsibility for it.  Their long opening hours are sufficient to meet the needs of local users and its location is not suitable for passing motorists&#39; use.</p>

    <p>Could someone in the know get a picture of the device in question and post it on the site so we all know what to avoid?</p>  <p>Just an idea . . .</p>

    <p>Have a look at:- <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/gall/0,,1348499,00.html">http://www.guardian.co.uk/gall/0,,1348499,00.html</a> to see some pictures of a typical device. If you do a Google search for &#39;pictures of skimming devices&#39; you&#39;ll find some other sites.</p>
