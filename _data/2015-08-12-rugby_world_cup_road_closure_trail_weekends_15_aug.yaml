    <p>Whilst it is an excellent idea to do a trial run, the crowds at these games will not reflect the size of the crowds during the world cup.  While the competition is on there are fan zones accommodating a further 15,000 people who will have to move into, around and out of the town.   How can this trial be judged on the partial crowd of the England v France game?</p>

    <p>&#39;Trail&#39; should be &#39;trial&#39; I  suppose. In fact these 2 events are dress rehearsals to try out what has long been planned. It will be too late to change anything very much. The important unknown for St Margaretians is how it will affect the H37 buses, our lifeline. They are planned to run normally - we must wait and see.</p>

    <p>From my own perspective I returned from the North last night and came in along and A4, turned right at Gillette corner and down Syon Lane to St.Margarets around 7pm (an hour before kick-off), to my relief there was no lengthy delay at the A316 roundabout and I got straight home.  There did seem to be a lot of rugby-fan-filled cars queueing back over Twickenham bridge but that is fairly normal, depending on how far back the queue stretched.</p>  <p>Any report/update on the knock-on effects of this?</p>  <p>Were there long tailbacks beyond Richmond into Chiswick or the other way out down the M3?</p>

    <p>Reposted from Twickerati for info:</p>  <p>&#39;Commented&#39; commented: &#39;Last night after the game someone fell in front of a train at the station. He suffered serious but non fatal injuries and was taken to hospital by air ambulance helicopter about 11pm. There were reports of people pushing and shoving to get on the trains, climbing over barriers and ignoring stewards instructions.</p>  <p>People were also complaining about how the crowds arriving at the station in the evening were handled. People were directed to leave via the over-crowded bridge at the front of the station making many of them wonder if it was safe. Lets hope things improve.&#39;</p>  <p><a href="https://twickerati.wordpress.com/2015/09/18/rwc2015-rugby-world-cup-visitors-guide-twickenham/">twickerati.wordpress.com/2015/09/18/rwc2015-rugby-world-cup-visitors-guide-twickenham</a></p>
