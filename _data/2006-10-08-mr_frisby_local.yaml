    <p>Ah, very sad. I was not a customer, having my own butcher further down the road, but I often passed and saw Mr F and his wife in the shop. Best wishes to him in his retirement.</p>  <p>But with what will we be landed now?</p>  <p>from Rog</p>

    <p>I suggested to Armstrongs on the Lower Mortlake Road (who I rate very highly) that they might be interested &amp; they said they were and had been to see it, but that the shop needs &pound;100K spending to meet H&amp;S standards. So, I guess the chances of it remaining a butchers are not high.</p>

    <p>We too switched to Armstrongs, and idly wondered whether they might be interested.  I hope they don&#39;t give up the idea just yet.  Armstrongs must be aware there is some sort of market in St Margarets, but how big that might be?</p>

    <p>The excellent butchers on Friars Stile Road at the top of Richmond Hill also looked at the shop, though at that stage Mr Frisby wasn&#39;t interested in selling. He will be desperately missed: with the loss of his shop and the bakers, the heart of the village has gone. Whatever happens to the shop, the fabulous interior, an exceptionally rare period butchers shop, with all its original features, deserves the most careful treatment. I&#39;ve bought from Mr Frisby since I first moved to St Margarets, but always found him a slightly severe figure. That changed completely after my son was born when, still with a rather wintry smile, he encouraged him to build sandcastles in the sawdust on the floor. Even then I told Samuel that one day, vhen no such shops survive, he would remember this experience as a link to a lost world.</p>

    <p>How about a petition asking Armstrongs to move in?</p>

    <p>Just to send Mr Frisby our very best wishes for his retirement. Both he and his wife will not be forgotton. We remember long queues outside his shop, when there were three butchers in St Margarets.</p>

    <p>Mr. Frisby will be sadly missed.  I, too, remember the long queues outside his shop and used to call there regularly for years while the children were growing up.  There used to be that moment when the cut of meat you had asked for was not available in the window and your heart sank when he swung off again down the stairs to the cold room.  You did need patience but always knew you had top quality so we would keep returning.  John and I wish him a happy retirement and hope to see him around in St. Margarets.</p>

    <p>My boyfriend (an ex butcher) and I would pass the shop and comment on the lost art of Butchering.  I am sorry to see yet another fine art go the wayside.  Butchering is something you very rarely see here in the States, and I hate to see it die out the other  place I love.  Please, find someone to carry on the tradition this fine gentleman painstakingly worked at.</p>

    <p>How about V Thomas &amp; Son at 387 St Margarets Road - though they are primarly a catering butcher to local restaurants, they have fantastic meat counter on Saturdays.  Apparently they are interested in the Frisby site but were told it had already gone to Armstongs.</p>

    <p>Wishing Mr Frisby all the best for his retirement. He will be missed. When we first moved to St. Margaret&#39;s a neighbour recommended we pay the shop a visit. I was not disappointed! I really hope that there is another local butcher who would like to take on the business. It would be sad to see the shop remain empty or taken on by a chain.</p>

    <p>I offered to either take over the butchery or to do something with Mr Frisby in the summer but he was not interested. And on making enquiries with the so called agent more recently I was told another butcher was in negotiation. Not sure where its at now.....</p>

    <p>George will be sorely missed.  His shop has been a large part of the &#39;village feel&#39; of St Margarets for many, many years.  I have read many newspapers while waiting for him to emerge from the cellar clutching a giant leg of something or other while climbing up that chain!! I had heard that Armstrong&#39;s of Richmond were in talks to take over the shop as a going concern, let&#39;s keep our fingers crossed that they keep Frisby&#39;s as a proper local butchers</p>
