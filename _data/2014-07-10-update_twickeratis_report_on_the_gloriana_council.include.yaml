    <p>Dear FOOTBRIDGE CAMPAIGNER,</p>  <p>Rumours abound that TFL actually made a site visit to the footbridge last Friday! The first since the public funded body formulated the proposal and entered into a stakeholder consultation. In any other business, I would say this lacked due diligence, logic and professionalism but then again TFL is a quango. Coincidentally, all the children&#39;s artwork was removed from the footbridge during the same timeline.</p>  <p>So, what now? To keep this campaign front and centre, It is time for individuals to contact lead decision makers personally. Many concerned residents and parents have already directly communicated with the major players, but the campaign would welcome anything you could do too! You may have your own story to tell about crossing the A316; you may be a concerned parent or resident; or maybe you are a concerned stakeholder, such as school, business, or community organisation. TFL should hear from all of you.</p>  <p>Those who will make the decisions are TFLs Managing Director of Surface Transport, Leon Daniels and the mayor, Boris Johnson. So, please keep this campaign alive and make a difference.</p>
