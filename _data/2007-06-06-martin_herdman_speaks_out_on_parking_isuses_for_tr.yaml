    <p>We can&#39;t let our village and community be distroyed.  It is up to all of us to object.  There is no point in complaining after it has happened.</p>

    <p>The council is consulting on a plan to use double yellow lines to improve and sight lines for cyclists [and, of course, pedestrians] at the junction of Kings and Beaconsfield Roads with Crown Road. This is not some rustic backwater but part of a signed and numbered cycle route [#037] linking Twickenham Bridge and Richmond to Twickenham town centre via Twickenham Park and Amyand Park Road. It&#39;s not much used at present but there&#39;s no doubt that one of the many changes we&#39;re going to have to make to mitigate the effects of climate change will be a massive switch from motoring to cycling; this will only happen if cycling is perceived by novices to be becoming much safer than it now appears to be. Hence the importance of defining these routes and making them safe.  I can see that the changes will be inconvenient for the traders directly affected, particularly in respect of deliveries. Maybe they can be modified to reduce the effect. Your ward councillors held surgeries in Winchester Hall two evenings this week so that they could hear from residents about their concerns. Did anyone go along to talk to them?</p>

    <p>Chris,</p>  <p>Myself and many other traders went to one of the surgeries this week. We raised several issues with the councillors including the double yellow lines. The council has not thought this issue through and has admitted mistakes in the consultation. Many local residents and traders were missed of this consultation in error, the deadine has now been extended and more consultation forms sent out.</p>  <p>Could I also point out the following:</p>  <p>This proposal does NOT affect deliveries. There are no additional unloading restrictions. Traders can contuine to load/unload as per now. The proposal removes one pay and display bay and up to 14 overnight/Sunday parking spaces - this will affect residents and visitors in the area concerned and have a knock on effect to residents in other roads.</p>  <p>Your comment re:cycle safety - it should be noted that the council has confirmed that the number of recorded accidents, involving cyclists in the area in question, over the past year is zero. It should also be noted that the double yellow lines give a clear road and allow motorists to pick up speed. Trials in other London boroughs include removing double yellow lines and adding parking bays as a method of slowing traffic down.</p>  <p>Surely any concerns regarding road safety should be targeted towards the genuine accident blackspots in St.Margarets.</p>  <p>Chris you state that the cycle route is not used much at present, I totally agree and point out that the parking spaces are used. At the time of writing this there are six cars (at least three I know are residents) parked in the spaces in question, oh and another space is taken up by a load of barriers and bollards dumped there last Tuesday - another issue for the council.</p>

    <p>It seems to me that double yellow lines will make it more not less dangerous for cyclists as then cars just race past. At the moment cars have to stop and give way to oncoming trafic.</p>

    <p>I run the Timothy Graham Gallery at no.46 Crown Road, and can hardly believe that people get paid by us to think up such ridiculous schemes. How many meetings did this one take and at what cost?</p>  <p>How many cyclists use this junction? Does anyone know? It would surely be much safer should the odd cyclist wish to go to Richmond, to go along Amyand Park Road and cross the traffic at the pedestrian lights by the station.</p>  <p>We lost some loading space when the pedestrian crossing was put in Crown Road. As a gallery we rely on large deliveries of large sheets of glass for our picture framing department and as it is suppliers complain about the lack of parking spaces as they are not allowed to walk along the street carrying this glass. If we don&#39;t get glass, we can&#39;t frame pictures so we&#39;ll be out of business immediately. Its hard enough around here with customers and delivery drivers being chased around by traffic wardens together with the plethora of parking restrictions and parking scratch cards (another half-witted idea) without our so-called public servants trying to make it even more difficult to keep business going.</p>  <p>There is a tendency in this country now to criminalize the law-abiding by the introduction of petty rules and restrictions and allow the real criminals to walk the streets unchecked.</p>  <p>Thank you for your attention.</p>

    <p>The Council are basically anti-car, as proven by the decision to ride rough-shod over objections to charging for parking permits on the basis of emmissions. They knew full-well that it is hugely expensive and impractical for people to simply change their car.<br /> I am a cyclist as well as a driver but believe that double-yellows to protect cyclists is a huge over-reaction. All we have to do is stop at the Crown Rd junction to check for traffic rather than sail blindly on - or use the crossing a few feet away. Crown Rd businesses rely on passing trade and that means short-term parking bays. Also, at night there are insufficient resident bays for Crown Rd, Napoleon Rd etc and residents depend on the current bays and single yellows for everyday parking. The sooner we vote the LibDem chumps out the better.</p>

    <p>Richard, good question. The consultation was only sent out to selected addresses (wonder why?) for example about a third of the residents in Beaconsfield Road have been consulted, but the removal of overnight parking spaces will affect the entire road because anybody who can not park at the top of the road will park further down and so on.<br /> The council have now sent out more consultation letters and extended the deadline for return. BUT the council has still not consulted all those concerned (e.g. all of Beaconsfield Road). The traders are compiling a list of concerned residents who would like to be included in the consultation an will be passing this onto Councillor Khosa this week.<br /> Richard if you would like to be added to the list please call into Cutters or Zorans in Crown Road and leave you details.</p>

    <p>The simplest way to deal with the issue of cyclists being able to cross the road there is to dispense with the current Zebra crossing, and instead put a traffic light controlled crossing outside the Curry Inn, with a bike light, similar to that a few hundred feet further along the cycle route at the St Margarets crossing</p>  <p>I use that cycle route, and do find it a dangerous crossing because the corner is often obstructed.  But that is not a reason to reduce the parking in Crown Road.</p>  <p>Can a deal not be struck with the owners of the St Margarets to allow 30 minute shopper parking at certain times, funded out of our Council tax, of  course? I am an enormous supporter of our local shops, and we are really lucky to still have some, so we need to find ways of increasing their trade.</p>  <p>Crown Road does get very congested, but that is partly because of a lack of parking spaces, not a superfluity of them, as people have a tendency to leave their cars in crazy places, on the basis that if you are going to get a ticket, you might as well get one when you are parked somewhere that is convenient for you.</p>  <p>Perhaps the top end of Crown Road needs to be one way, with parking and loading done of the side the shops are currently on, leaving the pub side clear.  This ought to increase the available area for loading and parking</p>  <p>Wider use of one way systems in St Margarets would reduce traffic congestion overall,  make junctions safer, and ease the flow of traffic through.  Often the right turn into Amyand Park Road makes the Richmond bound traffic stop completely, as people cannot squeeze past (The council did propose a one-way on Amyand Park Road  a few years ago, which was opposed by a number of residents as the necessary land restriction at the top of APR would cut down on parking spaces.  The council dropped the one-way, but cut narrowed the road anyway!)</p>

    <p>Confusing collisions-involving-cycles-for-one-year and the number-of-cycles that could be using the road seems a fudge, and won&#39;t help deliver more trade.</p>  <p>Over focus on the official cycle route isn&#39;t much help either.</p>  <p>In 2004 the largest cycle shelter (for 90 bikes) placed in a school in London was - guess where - Orleans Park. And within weeks it was packed. Perhaps it will be doubled one day. Probably some of these kids use Crown Road to get there. And why shouldn&#39;t there be more?</p>  <p>Councillors are most likely to take a balanced view of all uses of the road, and parking cars is slipping down in importance these days. Casualties are much higher.</p>  <p>Maybe traders could propose alternative ideas to Council that increase their trade and look after youngsters etc instead of battling the way the world is heading.</p>

    <p>Yesterday as I drove through outer Kingston I saw that they have introduced on side streets one hour free parking bays - which can ONLY be used for parking up to one hour. Perhaps a solution here?</p>
