    <p>I hope you have posted your letter to the Daily Mirror also.  They are the source of this information, and have a lot greater resources and readership than what you find here.  I&#39;m sure they will remove their article pretty quickly if you provide them with clear proof of their error.</p>  <p>There are an awful lot of bogus charity scams around, you must realise this, and also understand that ordinary people have little option other than to rely on investigative journalists such as they for information?</p>  <p>It&#39;s strange to consider that a company would consider suing the not-for-profit website of the  community on whom they rely for donations.</p>

    <p>Corinne Gardner is correct.</p>  <p>SOS Clothes are not a charity.</p>  <p>They are also not licened to collect as has been reported on many occasions by various groups and concerned individuals.<br /> Therefore the company is acting illegally and "treeofhope" need to be aware of the implications for themselves for their part in this.<br /> I would expect the authorities to be acting on this shortly.</p>

    <p>More information on companies/organisations/charities who make collections on the "Charity Bags" website: <a href="http://www.charitybags.org.uk/index.htm">www.charitybags.org.uk/index.htm</a>.</p>  <p>There is a lot of detailed information, including particular named companies, the law and rules for door-to-door collecting, as well as an outline of a 2003 report on this subject from the Charity Commission</p>

    <p>I manage a very well known charity shop of which for legal reasons I will not mention. Our collections in recent months have been effected on a huge scale by bogus collectors. We have proof that the drivers who collect on behalf of the tree of hope and sos have been collecting our charity bags! I have contacted the tree of hope and was directed to the company&#39;s accountant, she confirmed one of their van drivers registration plates which matched one of the ones that has been seen collecting our bags!</p>  <p>These drivers go around collecting other peoples charity bags and take them back to a location (which is known) from there they then take the items out for resale at car boots and markets!</p>  <p>We have all vehicle registration numbers, witness statements and addresses. I feel maybe the tree of hope and sos may need to take a very close look at their van drivers.</p>  <p>I am pleased to say the police are now taking this long standing problem seriously and are watching and investigating. We spend a lot of money on van drivers who post out and collect for us legitimately and it is soul destroying when they go to collect and come back with one bag because these bogus collectors have been and swept the area first!<br /> I am still awaiting a phone call from the tree of hope as promised by Audrey Jenkins, she said their chairperson would get back to me, this was 2 months ago now!</p>  <p>I don&#39;t feel your drivers are helping your cause tree of hope.</p>  <p>I would say to anyone who leaves a bag out for a charity collection, if you are unsure the person collecting is genuine ask them for I.D, all genuine drivers carry it with them proving they are contracted to collect for that charity, failing that call the charity concerned to check it out!</p>  <p>I welcome any comments on this from the tree of hope and sos!</p>

    <p>Hi Coco, I would recommend you take anything you wish to recycle to a charity shop. There are now so many of these bogus companies that if you leave a bag on your property chances are it will fall into the wrong hands.</p>

    <p>Good morning all that read this. this morning on the 9/10/2013 i just had a tree of hope envelope. posted through my letter box. i have never heared of the charity before. so checked it out for curiosity. and found this page. the young lad what posted it through. was what i would call of gypsy origin. that was dropped off in a old pick up truck. that looked like it was more used to collecting scrap. so all beware its time the police started to crack down on these people. who are making the genuine charity,s suffer. thought i would add this comment to help put people right. thanks.</p>

    <p>For information about Tree of Hope charity please visit the charities website at <a href="http://www.treeofhope.org.uk">www.treeofhope.org.uk.</a>. To find out more about the charity&#39;s clothing collections go to "Donate" then "Textile recycling". SOS Clothes Ltd. is a social business which has an exclusivity agreement to operate licensed House to House clothing collections on behalf of Tree of Hope. A lot of charities use commercial participators to provide support and help with fundraising activities and this partnership is no different and legitimate. Regarding the Mirror article, the article was fully investigated and found to be groundless. Unfortunately it is very difficult to get false articles online and blogs online removed. Thank you for your continued support to Tree of Hope.</p>
