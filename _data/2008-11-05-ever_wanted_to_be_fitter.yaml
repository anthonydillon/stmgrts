    <p>I am part of the Barnes Group - We meet at The OSO on Barnes Green on Saturday mornings 10 AM and basically have a ball for an hour. The time is over before you know it and you have exercised, had a laugh( we do a lot of that)and chatted ( we do even more of that!)and made new friends.   AND IT IS FREE!!!<br /> What are you waiting for!</p>
