    <p>The other day I noticed a shorter in length delivery vehicle unloading during the morning  (after the rush hour and school run) and there were no problems at all with traffic or congestion on the pavement.  I had no problems at all as a cyclist, but it is a nightmare should I be coming home during the school pick up time in the afternoon.</p>  <p>Mothers parked everywhere and anywhere regardless of the obstructions they were causing.  Perhaps more effort should be put into the problems these mothers, with their inconsiderate parking, are causing!!</p>

    <p>I wonder if other residents have noticed the parking of the tesco delivery trucks who seem to believe they have the right not only to block the street but also use the pavement as part of the parking space.  I have watched over the last few weeks the number of delivery trucks that are unable to fit into the loading bay.  They persistantly park with wheels on the kerb.  This also applies to the early morning delivery when there is no one else around.  They use the kerb, is there a reason?  I wonder who will pay for the cost of the damage this will cause.......I somehow doubt this will be Tesco!!!!!</p>

    <p>1) St. Margarets Road is a road suited to serving journeys made within St. Margarets and communities within the Borough. Such journeys are made on foot, by bicycle and nowadays by car.</p>  <p>The types of motor vehicles Tesco requires to sustain its operation in St. Margarets Road are delivery vehicles which are suited to main distribution roads.</p>  <p>The vehicles required by Tesco are not suited to St. Margarets Road and the vehicles discourage journeys made on foot and by bicycle.</p>  <p>2) St. Margarets Road accommodates businesses and shops whose offerings are provided with mutually beneficial sympathy to the character of St. Margarets village.</p>  <p>Tesco&#39;s operation "rolls out" a format which is applied nationwide without sympathy to the location in which it is installed. Tesco can produce a format once, therefore there is a one off cost for design which follows through to a greater chance of higher profits for Tesco.</p>  <p>3) The format itself, is a brightly commercial design which is quite visible from cars travelling along the road (when the shop front is not obscured by its delivery lorries). It is a convenience store. Cars plus convenience store equals car parking. However St. Margarets Road is not a car park. It is a road. Broadway Avenue is not a car park. It is an Avenue. Winchester Road is also a road and Amyand Park Road and Bridge Road are roads as well.</p>  <p>4) The lorries parking in the loading bay have the following effects : (i) totally eliminates visibility to pedestrians on the pavement from a car driver&#39;s vision from St. Margarets Road; (ii) lines of vision for a car driver when turning left into Broadway Avenue are clear only immediately before turning left; this requires an excessivley slow approach to the corner which combined with the reduced road width causes a backing up of traffic; (iii) danger to pedestrians has been introduced by Tesco&#39;s delivery lorries in points (i) and (ii) which will discourage journeys by foot and eventually cause the death of an infant, (iv) a level of driving care must now be exercised by residents and that level of care is unreasonable; I did not move into St. Margarets to assume greater driving responsibilities for the benefit of Tesco.</p>  <p>5) Tesco&#39;s operation in St. Margarets erodes valuable and rare standards. St. Margarets is a community which is a rich example of London life, culture and heritage. Tesco&#39;s operation might have been harmless. But, the delivery lorries are not suited to St. Margarets, tesco has then extended the loading bay, and now, reported in The Times, Tesco sells a sex aid in its stores. I don&#39;t want a store with a convenience goods brand offer stocking a sex aid.</p>
