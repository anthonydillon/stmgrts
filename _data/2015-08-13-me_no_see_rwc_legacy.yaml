    <p>Just to give some balance.</p>  <p>The World Cup trophy is coming to various local rugby clubs over the next month, for example it&#39;s coming to London Welsh rugby club in Kew on the 8<sup>th</sup> of September (12pm to 2pm).</p>  <p>There was a residents ticket ballot (which I got some decent tickets in!)</p>  <p>I&#39;m sure the world rugby museum will have lots about RWC 2015 especially if England win.</p>  <p>Twickenham train station has had a bit of a freshening up and Twickenham has some of the nicest pavement in SW London because of the world!</p>  <p>Maybe you should try living next to Wembley to see if that&#39;s any better.</p>

    <p>Overused word "legacy" these days.  It usually takes the form of a bequest upon someone&#39;s death but more recently it&#39;s been applied to Tony Blair - illegal wars in the Middle East and the 2012 Olympics - did it live up to the promises made.  I agree with Martyn Day, so far I haven&#39;t heard of any "proposed legacy".  Maybe they are just being honest - there won&#39;t be one (aside from the fabulous Twickenham pavements)</p>  <p>As for the comparison with Wembley, all we have to do is wait until Chelsea take up residency.</p>

    <p>Free fanzone for all matches at Old Deer Park, free tickets for residents at the internationals on the 15th Aug, free stadium tours for residents, free rugby festival at redlees park on the 13th sept...plus the RWC ticket ballots</p>  <p>I think they&#39;re offering quite a bit actually</p>

    <p>Didn&#39;t you notice there was an International stadium when you moved into the area?! Being able to walk to a Word Cup will be amazing. Suggest you get out more.</p>

    <p>Yet more nimbyism, I feel. We don&#39;t NEED a legacy, although I hope that local traders will be able to fill their coffers from the large influx of visitors during the 6 weeks of the tournament. At least the "no Gloriana" rent-a-mob won&#39;t be able to stop the RWC15 in its tracks.</p>

    <p>I was about to add a comment but I think Robyn and Colin have pretty much nailed what my points were going to be.  In summary yes, Martyn Day, you are missing something which probably says more about you than the RWC.  Those of us who have started from a positive standpoint and kept our eyes peeled have tickets to matches, places on stadium tours, excited friends and family planningonce in a lifetime visits to enable them to walk to and from a RWC - and those of us who are local traders have a fantastic opportunity to showcase our truly brilliant area to an international audience who might not otherwise have come this way... Pretty exciting really!</p>

    <p>I&#39;ve never been interested but I believe there&#39;s already a Museum of Rugby at the stadium?</p>  <p>If there were tobe a meaningful "legacy", in my opinion it would involve some decent joined-up and separated cycle lanes to get us around through the road closures :)</p>

    <p>I accept that there are many people who will get a lot out of the RWC - the economic benefits of an increasing footfall, the residents&#39; ticket ballot, the places on stadium tours, the free rugby festival in Redlees Park and free admission to watch rugby matches on giant screens in the Fanzone. All these things  are very laudable but they are of little or no interest to the thousands of others who are simply not interested in rugby. It is as if our neighbours are having a very long, loud and lively party butwe&#39;re not invited! All I am asking for is something for the entire community, the old and the young, the fit and the fragile, those who will welcome the RWC with open arms and those who quietly wish it would go away. All I am asking for is something that inyears to come we will be able to point at or refer to and say "That is there because of the Rugby World Cup in 2015 when half the world came to St. Margarets." Surely that is not too much to ask?</p>
