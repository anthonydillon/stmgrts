    <p>St Margrets is my shining start. I am one of those parents who tried everything at my disposal to bring my family together at mealtimes but i have failed miserably. It is not so much food which is creating the problem, but the whole lifestyle of the kids i am worried about. The first thing i can change is the food put on the table. I am a very normal cook with no exotic skills but i like to think that i am fairly good in what i muster. However, if i take you classes i have a feeling that i will have a whole new blog of treats to entice the family with. I am trying to get a group of us together to visit you one morning and learn all that we can from you. Running this as a free service is really unbelievable. How do you manage that? Please let me know if you are running classes in the morning these days so that i might arrange a date.</p>
