    <p>The damage continues on up the food chain:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.wildlondon.org.uk/Blog/river-crane-update">www.wildlondon.org.uk/Blog/river-crane-update</a></p>  <p>A report for Thames Water shortly after the incident investigated the effects on the habitat; almost every species in the river was badly affected, with the exception of a particular type of snail that is able to clamp its shell down tight.  In some locations it was so bad that 100% of the midges were even wiped out.</p>
