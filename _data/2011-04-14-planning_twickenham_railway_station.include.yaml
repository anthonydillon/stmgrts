    <p>The basic grounds for objecting relate to:</p>  <ol> <li>Height of the building. Ten storeys is far higher than the council&#39;s guidance (SPD)  for the area of a maximum of four to five.</li> <li>The scale of the building is completely beyond that of the surrounding area.</li> <li>The lack of parking affects is likely to impact anyone that lives around the centre of Twickenham.</li> <li>The lack of new school places appears to be a significant issue, given the already limited places and the requirement to travel.</li> <li>The development does not take into account the requirement to move improve the infrastructure to move rugby fans in and out of the station, The development makes the problem worse as it eats into the car park and reduces the space available.</li> </ol>

    <p>The Solum scheme [#10/3465/FUL] requires an Environmental Impact Study, so the officers have been given twice the usual time to get this done and write a report. They are working towards a planning committee decision on Thursday May 12.</p>  <p>The committee also has to make its mind up about the podium, having ducked out of that decision previously, so this is likely to be a long and fractious meeting . .</p>
