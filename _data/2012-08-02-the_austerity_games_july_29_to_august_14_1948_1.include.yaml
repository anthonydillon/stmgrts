    <p>Does anyone know where specifically in Richmond Park the athlete&#39;s village was in 1948?  Obviously it&#39;s a large park but I would love to know where the athlete&#39;s were housed.  It would be nice to imagine it as you&#39;re walking through the park.</p>

    <p>Eric&#39;s question is answered in this week&#39;s "Rich and Twick" by Michael Davison of &#39;Friends of Richmond Park&#39;... "From Kingston Gate car park, cross the road and walk up the steps to the top of the rise. From here a stretch of flat ground extends towards Ladderstile gate. This was the site of the Olympic village...the only trace remaining is a flight of eight steps near Danns Pond".</p>
