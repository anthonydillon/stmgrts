    <p>Great news that Moormead Park is now being patrolled! For too long, this wonderful park has been blighted by graffiti and alcohol fuelled youngsters. Can anyone give an update on the future of the Pavilion? There was talk that it would be smartened up and a tender put out to open a small cafe there.</p>  <p>Regards Rod Cheesman</p>

    <p>Whilst I agree with the sentiments that a camera will be useful, I can&#39;t help thinking that a temporary &#39;visible&#39; camera will only halt the problems for its&#39; temporary placement.</p>  <p>If it&#39;s going to be temporary, then hide it, use it to catch the criminals and lock them away - i.e. use it to solve the problem in the longer term.</p>  <p>Otherwise, this is sounding like &#39;lip-service&#39; to try and shut-up the complainents, rather than resolving the real issues.</p>

    <p>On Thursday 28th Sept, a group of 10 year old boys were approached in the Moormead Park playground by a group of older boys. 2 of the 10 year olds were assaulted - one with a possible broken nose. I am told that the temporary cameras were not working on this occasion.</p>

    <p>I am sure a camera on the mead will be of use in deterring unwelcome activity, but i can&#39;t help thinking that this is the wrong time of year to be placing it there, surely it is the summer months that show the most activity and if it is to be done, why on a temporary basis?</p>

    <p>I hope they will retrieve the footage from last night (Friday 6<sup>th</sup> October) then.  We arrived at football this Saturday morning to find that my children&#39;s name for the old playground - "The Writing Swings" they call them - had returned.  Much of the equipment is covered in black marker pen scrawl.. The pen itself was still there on the ground, accompanied by the usual beer cans and broken glass.</p>  <p>Action please, Police?</p>

    <p>Graffiti reported 9/10 and am assured it will be cleaned within the week. Once the morons realise that it is quickly and consistently wiped off, they will stop leaving it.</p>

    <p>The CCTV pictures of this vandalism have now made it to the local paper - see the local "Richmond Guardian" free newspaper, 11th Jan 2007, page 7. (can&#39;t find a web site with the pictures online)</p>
