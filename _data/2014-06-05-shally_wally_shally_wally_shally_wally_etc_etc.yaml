    <p>I am both one of "some archivists" and "other sources" mentioned above. I find it intriguing that the author of the above article undoubtedly has read the discussion from 2012 on the song in question - most often known by the international name "Ging Gang Goolie" found at</p>  <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ging_Gang_Goolie">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ging_Gang_Goolie</a></p>  <p>and still maintains the myth of Baden-Powell as author of the song.</p>  <p>Deep and detailed  research into scout archives - including B-P archives - and National Libraries both in UK and USA and elsewhere has failed to find any evidence of Baden-Powell as initiator of said song, not the least author. Neither any evidence of the song in connection with the 1920 Jamboree.</p>  <p>Conclusions:</p>  <ul> <li>The Baden-Powell connection is a myth or even a premeditated hoax.</li> <li>The  performance of the song at the 1920 Jamboree is also a myth/hoax.</li> </ul>  <p>Whereas similar research in folklore archives and National Libraries in Europe, USA and elsewhere and with some 25 scout associations all over the world has proved that the song with almost identical lyrics and score was performed well before the 1920 Jamboree and B-P&Acirc;&acute;s alleged penmanship: 1901 German student song book, 1905  cabaret in Sweden, 1913/14 campfire song in UK - not scouts, 1918 Swedish student song book, 1919 Danish scout song book - earliest scout song book occurrence so far.</p>  <p>So I wonder what new evidence or what specific purpose has been the drive for writing an article 2014 that claims that now "At last it can be told. The true story of &#39;Ging Gang Gooli&#39;...".? Whereby the article&Acirc;&acute;s "true story" of the origin is a copycat of previous unproven myths on the internet.</p>  <p>I would hope you can do much better than that ...</p>
