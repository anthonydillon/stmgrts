    <p>My wife&#39;s brother John Maiden worked at what we believe were the &#39;Winchester Works&#39; but this was situated in Amyand Park Road near the footbridge over the railway towards St, Margaret&#39;s Station. Anyone anything on this? Does anyone remember Stan Cox&#39;s electrical shop at corner of Amyand Park Road opposite the station?</p>

    <p>On 14.5.2019 I visited the Sammy Miller Motorcycle Museum at New Milton, Hampshire and found a Grigg motorcycle made in Twickenham. I&#39;d never heard of Grigg or that motorcycles were made in Twickenham. It caight my eye as I live in Twickenham. The motorcycle was in excellent condition.</p>
