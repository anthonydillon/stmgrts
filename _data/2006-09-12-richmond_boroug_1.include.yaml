    <p>Moormead Park has been in urgent need of toilet facilities, I would strongly request the Council to consider providing much needed facilities in the park, perhaps even an automatic one.</p>

    <p>I agree that Moormead Park needs toilet facilities. This could well be in line with the smartening up of the Pavilion interior which is well overdue.</p>
