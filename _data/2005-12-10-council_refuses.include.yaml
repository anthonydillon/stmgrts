    <p>A word of warning. Apparantly at least 2 people have had their cards cloned and then money taken out of their accounts after using the ATM outside Tescos.</p>  <p>Not sure what you can do to prevent this except be aware of anything unusual looking about the machine or of anyone looking over your shoulder while you key in PIN.</p>

    <p>For anyone around during the day, you  can use your cash point card for free at the Post Office to withdraw cash - It seems to work for most banks</p>  <p>Incidentally, you can pay cheques in as well.</p>
