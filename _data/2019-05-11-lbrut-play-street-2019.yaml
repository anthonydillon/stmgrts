    <p>Can someone explain to me the point of closing a street for children to play in on just one day a year for "up to four hours"? If you are going to close roads - or at least advise drivers that children may be playing in the road - do it for a decent length of time, the school holidays perhaps.  What the council if offering here is a token closure. Of course children need places to play but it should be constant, safe and reliable and not just for an hour or two one day a year!</p>
