    <p>Hello,</p>  <p>My daughter Melissa, who is 4 year olds, has always been a very keen dancer. In September last year as she was entering her bilingual nursery in Clapham, I though I really should find her a dance class nearby but then I realised that the nursery employed a ballet teacher part time and as a consequence Melissa had a Ballet class every week. However, from next september, she will change school to go to the Orleans Infant School and she will miss enormously her dance class. Her best french friend Manon is going to your class on thurdays and as Corine her mum seems to say a lots of good things about you and the class, I was wondering if by any chance, you&#39;ll have a place for my daughter from next september and if you do summer classes for this group of age. Many thanks,</p>  <p>Val&#233;rie</p>
