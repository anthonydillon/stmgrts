    <p>What utter cretins - and so are their parents, very likely. All we can hope for is that as they grow up they will remember what they did and have a certain amount of regret. Hopefully, it might not be long before they&#39;re arrested for a similar crime in another location.</p>  <p>I feel very sorry for the folk who worked so hard on the pavilion, the planters and playground.</p>
