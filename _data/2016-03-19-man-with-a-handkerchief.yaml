    <p>Martyn, thank you for this moving, powerful piece. I too am certain about the Holocaust. I will share your writing with others.</p>

    <p>No disrespect, but the man photographed in the photos and in the moving video without the scarf across his face was my grandfather, Alfred Lavender.  He told me the story of riding the bulldozer and cleaning up the bodies.  He was in the advance party that went into Belsen to open the gates before the rest of the troops and tanks arrived.  He was SAS (I found this out later when more information was released in the past few years, declassified that is).  There were 2 men who rode that bulldozer, but one could not stand it any longer.  I have a close up of the photos also.  The reason I know that there were two because of two facts: my grandfather told me, and I got confirmation of this from the curator of the commemoration museum at Belsen.  My grandfather never really got over what he saw, and the first thing he mentioned was the children, and how if he had marched faster, that he could have saved them.  This story has been with our family for all my life, and I was the first he told about this.  Additionally, if you look at the cap badge on the hat of the driver of the bulldozer, it is not the same as the above gentleman.  The cap badge is SAS.</p>  <p>What is also concerning here is the man with the hankerchief was named as Frank Chapman.</p>
