    <p>One of the cousins admitted the fifth picture was a actual fairy. Which picture was this? Even though this was all a hoax it&#39;s still a enchanting tale. Beautiful black &amp; whites I see this as a artful &amp; very majestic piece of history. Hope to hear from someone soon &amp; thank you for sharing this wonderful story great job!</p>
