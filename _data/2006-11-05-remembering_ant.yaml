    <p>If I am remembering the right gentleman, he also learned Welsh, although he was English. He was always able to advise on how to get to where you wanted to go, the best and the cheapest way. He has been much missed at the station and I am sorry I will no longer bump into him in the area</p>

    <p>That is very sad news indeed. I grew up in Dorking in the 70s/80s and remember Mr Wilkinson from when he used to work at Dorking station. When I moved to St. Margarets I was pleasantly surprised to see he had transferred here. He was always very polite and happy to talk to anyone. I remember the flute as well. He made travelling through St. Margarets station a pleasure and I&#39;m sure will be greatly missed.</p>
