    <p>Is there no way that the pavilion can be used also commercially as a small cafe.  I am sure this would be hugely popular in this area where there is no other cafe around and large numbers of families??</p>

    <p>Agree with the idea of using part of the pavilion as a cafe - would be a great idea.</p>

    <p>Idea of a cafe would be great given the park is used by families for recreation and sporting events. It would encourage a greater semse of community.</p>

    <p>I wonder how the proposed cafe might affect the already saturated traffic conditions in the area</p>  <p>Ben Khosa</p>

    <p>Yes that would certainly need some thought.</p>  <p>I wonder if anyone is aware of the incident on the Mead the evening of Friday 12 May.  Teenage girls had lit a fire and the fire brigade were called.  Rather alarmingly they were unable to get to the fire because of the parking in the area and left the scene.  Luckily the girls had seen the fire engine and put the fire out while the vehicle was trying to negotiate around the parked cars.  Dread to think what would have happened if it had been a residents house on fire.</p>
