    <p>The thatched cottage at the top of this page was called Pear Tree Cottage &amp; was the home of my great, great aunt Mary Ann Harbour on my mother&#39;s side. I think it&#39;s the same photo as the one I&#39;ve got of her &amp; her friend Miss. Emily Hickmott standing outside. I have Victorian photos of great, great aunt &#39;Annie&#39; taken in the 1870&#39;s &amp; again in old age. I also have photos of her mother ( b.1819 d.1883) &amp; 5 of her sisters. She was apparently well known in the area &amp; was very well liked &amp; taught at the Sunday school. Do contact me at my email address above if you would like any copies or any other information about her.</p>
