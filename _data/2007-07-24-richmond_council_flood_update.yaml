    <p>Hats off the council (for a change :-)). We were quite badly flooded last Friday, and so had bags and bags of ruined stuff in black sacks waiting for the bin men.</p>  <p>Imagine my surprise when I can home from work on Wednesday, and they had taken everything we&#39;d left.</p>  <p>Thanks a lot.  It was one less headache after a pretty unpleasant experience.</p>

    <p>That is really not a nice incident. Many furniture and appliances where broken because of that unexpected flood.</p>
