    <p>It would be useful, please, for Mr Beck to repeat in writing his verbal assurances that the current temporary HVAC equipment (which is "much" not "slightly" noisier than that destroyed in the fire) will operate for no more than two weeks i.e. until 14 May maximum and that the new permanent equipment will be quieter than the destroyed plant. Near neighbours would welcome quick assurances, please.</p>

    <p>David et al - On Wednesday night at 10pm I went into Tescos and spoke to the supervising engineer.  He explained that the fire had destroyed all the acoustic baffling within the aircon system.  To cut a long story short he agreed to turn the system off there and then.  At 8am Thursday morning the system was back on - and noticeably noisy half way down Broadway Avenue even with the ambient traffic noise.  Mick Beck was in the store and agreed to the following until the baffling was remade and refitted next Wednesday.  A time switch would turn on the aircon at 8am and turn it off at 8pm.  The plant unit that&#39;s making the noise is also used to refrigerate all the produce. On Saturday morning the aircon company would attempt a temporary baffling arrangement on the output vent.  If this was thought to be unsatisfactory (by residents) he would consider closing the store on Sunday to avoid a neighbour nuisance.  I pointed out what to me was the obvious.  The store should never have been reopened until all the work was complete, and the noise nuisance was undoing all the bridges he was trying to build with the local community.  He agreed</p>  <p>Harry Jacobs</p>

    <p>Re: my post above. Having recently been misquoted myself on this very website, my apologies to Mick Beck - it wasn&#39;t him I spoke to as I thought at the time, but some other Tesco employee. I met Mick this afternoon who also was concerned about the noise, and has assured me that Saturday&#39;s temporary &#39;fix&#39; will work!</p>  <p>Harry Jacobs</p>
