    <p>I am so glad to see how vibrant this site is, when I were a wee boy the area of St.Margarets was a walk with my Brother from Twickenham to Richmond so that we could walk up Richmond Hill, years later I would go to eel pie island with friends in the pop industry in which I worked, And Trevor Bayliss  a guy I spent a happy hour with as showed me the prototype windup radio and the many honours&#39; he rightfully received for his invention.<br /> I attended the Church at Twickenham, and was Conformed there into the C.of.E.<br /> Later my Parents moved us all to Winchester and I attended Boarding School there, and my memories of Twickenham faded.<br /> But I later went to a wedding in the Lord Russell&#39;s old home and renewed my love of Richmond  and Twickenham.<br /> Last year I was lucky to meet Lord Attenborough and his Wife Sheila Sim, who was pushing him, along with a helper by the Thames, we had a small chat about the old day&#39;s, but that&#39;s another story, I had something to do with the film industry once, and Beavor production&#39;s named of course after his Richmond Green house were part of my life.</p>
