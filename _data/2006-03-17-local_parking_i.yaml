    <p>We have a 93 year old mother who lives at 18 Moormead road. We come from Reading and the train is too expensive so a car is a must. We also need it to take her out as she has had a stroke and mobility is restricted. Now that you have placed car parking meters is there still a restriction on entering via the barrier road until after 9.30am or do we still have to drive round to St Margarets High Street to gain access. As the meters have, in effect, stopped commuters I presume the barrier is now redundant I would appreciate clarification on this matter as it can be important if, in an emergency, we need to get there quickly.

    <p>The barrier is still there and there are no planes to remove it; it is there to block the rat run to commuters, not to control parking.</p>
