    <p>Well done Martyn, yet another bit of great nostalgia, brings back happy memories.</p>

    <p>I first heard "Stay With Me" when John Peel played it with the introduction..."I&#39;m no longer prepared to argue who is the greatest rock band in the world"  I assumed he was referring to the Rolling Stones until he had seen the Faces.  THIS is a solid gold classic.  Thanks so much.</p>
