    <p>I suggest St Margarets residents re visit Cllr Khosa CPZ Update posted on 5 July 2006 and read the comments it attracted.<br /> Particularly residents north of the A316 as I expect the free all day parking for non residents<br /> south of the A316 is coming to an end soon.</p>  <p>Harry Jacobs comments tell it as it is, giving those that are new to the area an insight of CPZ<br /> history in St Margarets.<br /> History will repeat itself and there is only one direction the non resident parking can go in<br /> St Margarets-----north of the A316!</p>
