    <p>Up to a point, Tesco is upfront about Harris &amp; Hoole: somebody had helpfully added in chalk "this is Tesco" to the banner ads wrapping the window - as I came past tonight all trace of this had been carefully washed off</p>

    <p>I really can see no need for yet another coffee shop in St Margarets. It would have been nice if the locals had been consulted more about this..........after all we are apparently living in times where "localism" is at the top of the agenda. I would like to see the "real" local independant coffee shops thrive and not lose out at the expense of yet another big chain. I shall not be going in there I am afraid</p>

    <p>Seriously? You have a problem with an empty shop space being taken over by a new business? Or is it the coffee you have an issue with? After all, there&#39;s nothing worse than an espresso-head trying to find his next fix...</p>  <p>Admittedly I know nothing about the processes that went into pitching for the space once Superdrug vacated it. If there were any fantastic, creative, wonderful, local businesses that were pushed out at the expense of this company, then yes - I might feel like I have a stronger opinion on this.</p>  <p>As it is, there&#39;s gonna be a new coffee shop that I may or may not use... not bothered.</p>  <p>Tesco next door (whether linked to the new "evil" coffee shop or not) is open till 11pm every night, it&#39;s convinient. I use it a lot - as I&#39;m sure most of the St Margarets residents do. Looking at the queues when I go in I figure it&#39;s pretty popular. Of course I&#39;d much rather it was a Waitrose, but hey - we all have to slum it sometimes huh? ;)</p>

    <p>The coffee is, allegedly, good. An empty shop is to be filled at a time when national retail occupancy rates are plummeting. Business rates will be paid. Two entrepreneurs have minority backing from a major retailer in whom ALL your pension funds are invested. None of you took the initiative and opened a paraffin and chisel shop. Like the man said, get over yourself. If you don&#39;t like it, boycott it. I recall there was a lot of talk of boycotting Tesco when the previous independent(ish) overpriced under stocked poor quality food retailer was replaced. I wonder how that boycott worked out?<br /> I think the expression is FirstWorldProblems!</p>

    <p>What a load of nonsense. H&amp;H / Tesco are free to open wherever they want. If you don&#39;t like it, simply don&#39;t buy a coffee there. If enough people decide the same it wont be profitable and will close.<br /> Personally, I quite like the Twickenham one so will give it a go. I&#39;ll still buy coffee from the other shops as I do now, it just gives another option.<br /> Also, please get facts straight in an article. H&amp;H have stated Tesco control a lot  less than 49%.</p>

    <p>In the Twickenham H&amp;H the coffee is good, the service is polite and attentive and I was&#39;nt charged &pound;3.50 for a child&#39;s hot chocolate, as I was at Brulas pantry (I got a refund and I&#39;m not going there again)Good luck to H&amp;H maybe they can show St Margarets &#39;Independants&#39; how to look after customers properly. Time to up there game..<br /> (that&#39;s not inculding Zoran, the only truly consistent coffee shop owner in st mags)</p>  <p>A fresh fish shop would be nice, when the next one closes...</p>

    <p>Well thank you for letting us know so now we can make an informed choice.</p>  <p>Last Sunday was the Crown Road summer event contributed to by the council, RFU and the local traders amongst others. If you want this sort of thing in St Margarets you need local traders supporting the local community.  Not sure what Tesco contributed...</p>  <p>Yes we use Tesco but if I can buy the same thing locally I do. It&#39;s a choice but if you leave it all to market forces multinational companies have  much deeper pockets...</p>

    <p>So thank goodness commenters such as David, Mrs B, Ms A, Moormead and more to come no doubt have added balance to a biased article!! The St Margs Tesco is v handy and I would be happy to see it a tad bigger. HH coffee is good and they are smart enough to get serious backing. And all British!  I hope it is a success - better than a boarded premise too!!</p>

    <p>Martyn, I could perhaps take you a bit more seriously if you weren&#39;t so disingenuous yourself. I refer of course to this rather sensationalist line "it is in fact an expanding chain that is 49% owned by Tesco".<br /> The Tolleys and Tesco have only ever said that Tesco holds a minority stake, which the Guardian took liberty to change to "Up to 49%". Note the "Up to" which you&#39;ve conveniently dropped. However, they&#39;ve also stated that Tesco is not the single largest shareholder (<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/9797724/Sunday-interview-Nick-Tolley-chief-excecutive-of-Harris-Hoole.html">www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/9797724/Sunday-interview-Nick-Tolley-chief-excecutive-of-Harris-Hoole.html</a>). Now given that each sibling is likely to have a decent stake in the business, they likely have other investors too and Tesco is a minority shareholder and not the largest, it is impossible for them to have a 49% stake. It&#39;s probably at the most 25% and I doubt it is even that high.</p>  <p>So for me Harris+Hoole = Taylor Street Baristas far more that Harris+Hoole = Tesco.</p>  <p>I&#39;m all for supporting local businesses though and will continue to do so as long as they continue to offer friendly local service for good quality/value (Grounded will have to up their game though to deliver consistently good coffee).</p>

    <p>I don&#39;t drink coffee, but If I did it wouldn&#39;t been in an oversized H&amp;H. I&#39;d rather an empty shop than Tesco expanding, wait for the knock through in years to come. Goodbye independent traders! Let the big boys make all the bucks, they need it to top up their over filled bank accounts and turn every other high street into a clone. How many more empty shops will be created by people choosing to drink their coffee in there. Support the local traders!</p>

    <p>I&#39;m glad the shop has been taken as it was becoming an eyesore, but it seems rather a large shop just to sell a cup of coffee, what we needed was them to share it with a hairdressers &amp; estate agents, after all, we are short of all 3 in "The Village" just how much coffee can the villagers take !!!</p>  <p>I, like Martin, would have liked a chisel, paraffin &amp; whitewash outlet.</p>

    <p>The reality is a large chain, whether owned by Tesco or not can afford to undercut an independent. They buy in bulk and so drive the prices down and put the little guy out of business. We are very lucky to live in an area where we do have some unusual shops. Please let&#39;s avoid St Margarets becoming homogenised. Support our local businesses.</p>

    <p>I don&#39;t care if this shop is Tesco owned, I&#39;m just miffed that St. Margaret&#39;s now has yet <strong>another</strong> coffee shop rather than a useful outlet to offer goods and services.  Why does our village need yet another coffee shop amongst the myriad of cafes; five plus a sixth to come in the space of 500 metres? Let&#39;s not forget the coffee shop in the train station... Come on.</p>

    <p>Well thank you Martyn for bringing this up - I was wondering if anyone cared and clearly we do.</p>  <p>Of course I use Tesco Express, depressing and badly run as it is.  Of course it&#39;s depressing this space is not being used as a gym or a bank or a fish monger or a nursery, but presumably this was a deal between 2 chain retailers and why would they care what we think?</p>  <p>I will continue to support local businesses whenever I can and I don&#39;t care if H &amp; H&#39;s coffee is good.  Why do we have to subscribe to Tesco&#39;s hamfisted attempts to soften its High St image after they have done their best to homogenize it, they&#39;ve recently bought Giraffe.</p>  <p>BTW buy your chisels at Cutter&#39;s which, with Percy Chapman in Twick, is my favourite shop!</p>

    <p>One of the Dave&#39;s (above) has said he&#39;d like to see Tesco&#39;s a &#39;Tad&#39; bigger.  Well he&#39;s about to get his wish.  The rear area presently being used as their storage area is going to be converted for extra shop usage, and their storage will be elsewhere in Phelps House.  Whether their new arrangements will increase or decrease the number of deliveries they receive each day, remains to be seen.  However I suspect that the increase in the store size will alter the customer demographic especially at the weekends and evenings to include more people arriving by car to do a weekly shop.  So possibly even more local traffic and parking congestion could be the next hot St Margarets topic.  In passing if I were the management team of Gymboree and wanted to remain where I was, I would be looking ahead to when my lease in Phelps House was next due for renewal as I suspect one of their near neighbours might be very interested in acquiring their site.  For those who don&#39;t know, the new owners of the site will shortly be building/converting part of the upper floors into some luxury (?) apartments.  Obviously as a close neighbour of Phelps House I have a vested interest in what&#39;s happening.</p>

    <p>Harry: I really can&#39;t imagine anyone coming by car to St Margarets to do a weekly Tesco shop in such a poorly-stocked store when, for 5 minutes extra drive, they could shop in the Tesco hypermarket at Mogden Lane. This sounds like the same scaremongering that predicted Sodom and Gomorrah when the (late) Parvinu opened; of course it was strictly regulated under planning and nothing untoward happened at all.</p>  <p>Dave is now 63: why is Tesco buying Giraffe in any way &#39;homogenising&#39; the High Street?</p>

    <p>Sorry St Stephen if you took my first comment to be scaremongering as it was partially a statement of fact (ie the store is going to be enlarged with a greater selection of produce), and my personal opinion that it might well attract the more car bound shopper irrespective of the relative proximity of two large Tesco stores.  I&#39;ll be more than delighted when experience proves you right.</p>  <p>Harry Jacobs Broadway Avenue</p>

    <p>Now I do like a good cup of coffee and was a bit &#39;ish&#39; when it was announced that a H+H was opening because of the Tesco tie in. I&#39;ve given them two whirls.... one to see what their coffee was like... too bitter in this case and the other to get some of their coffee beans, too old. So I won&#39;t be returning and continue to order my coffee from the Ouseburn Coffee Co, Monmouth Coffee &amp; HR Higgins instead then make my own at home.... much better, and a darned sight cheaper.</p>
