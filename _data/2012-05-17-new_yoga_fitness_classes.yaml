    <p>I would be very interested in joining this class. I&#39;ve never done yoga, but would very much like to work on toning my body, and have long thought that this would be a good way to do it.</p>  <p>Can you please advise if I need to sign up, or if we just show up on the day?</p>

    <p>Hi Elizabeth<br /> Given your comments it sounds like this class might just be perfect for you, Yoga is a great way to tone the body and this class will do just that, whilst introducing you to some key yoga postures.</p>  <p>So that I can manage the class numbers, If you would like to come along please book with me in advance by emailing  <a href="mailto:%63%6F%6E%74%61%63%74%40%79%6F%67%61%2D%66%69%74%6E%65%73%73%2E%63%6F%2E%75%6B">contact@yoga-fitness.co.uk</a><br /> I will then need to send over a health questionnaire for you to fill in beforehand, so that if you have any injuries I can make sure that I cater for them in the class.</p>  <p>With warm regards<br /> Sammie Mason<br /> Yoga Fitness</p>
