    <p>Politics is a brutal business and Vince clearly paid the price for his role in the Coalition along with Hughes, Laws, Alexander, Davey, Kennedy etc - all good people in my opinion. Dr Mathias will boost the number of women in the Commons which is all to the good. I hope Labour chooses a leader who can reach out from their Tory bashing core, which is where they seem happiest, and that Cameron really does bring back some One Nation Toryism - but I won&#39;t hold my breath for either.</p>

    <p>I am as gutted for Vince as Dr Mathias appeared to be in her gracious acceptance speech. We will miss him nationally but especially locally.</p>

    <p>Sorry to see Vince go, he fought hard for us on local issues, but he lost some credibility by chucking in his hand with the Tories, strange that  only 36% of national voters wanted the Tories in, so the other 64% of us don&#39;t count, how weird is that, this antiquated system has to change.</p>

    <p>Well done Tania, but thank you Vince. I hope we still hear you adding your views to the issues of the day.</p>  <p>Alsie42, one of the opportunities given to us all in the last parliament (thanks to Vince and the Liberal Democrats) was an opportunity to change this &#39;antiquated system&#39;, but as a nation we chose not to. Like it or not, that&#39;s democracy!</p>

    <p>What actually happened in the 2015 election and the maths are not that hard.</p>  <p>Vince Cable in 2010 got 32483 votes of 59721 = 54.3% Tories in 2010 got 20343 votes of 59721 = 34% Total number of votes for Vince and Tory = 52826 Therefore Vince&#39;s majority in 2010 was 12140 = 20.3% Total of votes for UKIP, Labour and Green = 6125 = 10.2%</p>  <p>Vince Cable in 2015 got 23563 votes of 62004 = 38% Tania Mathias in 2015 got 25580 votes of 62004 = 41.2% Total number of votes Vince and Tory = 49143 Tania&#39;s majority in 2015 was 2017 = 3.3% Total of votes for UKIP, Labour and Green = 12661 = 20.4% An increase of = 6737 from 2010</p>  <p>UKIP    went from 868 to 3069 taking 2201 votes from Vince (353% increase) Labour  went from 4583 to 7129 taking 2546 votes from Vince (155% increase) Green  went from 674 to 2463 taking 1789 votes from Vince (365% increase) Tory    went from 20343 to 25580 taking 5237 votes from Vince (12.5% increase)</p>  <p>So here is the first false claim, in reality the Tories did not win, as the 5237 increase in the Tory vote from 2010, was not enough to have over-turned the 12140 majority. The change in the vote was helped by the Tories and well done; but the real outcome, was decided by the other parties. So the Tories have a great debt of gratitude to the other parties for this result, because they took the needed votes from Vince.</p>  <p>The next false claim that UKIP only takes votes from the Tories also ends here. In Twickenham UKIP took votes from the Lib Dems. It has been proved that UKIP not only takes votes from Labour (Red) and Tory (Blue) to make UKIP purple, putting UKIP squarely at the centre of UK politics. But now it is proved that we also take votes off the Lib Dems, a party that claims to be a centre party, but it is really a party that would let Brussels run Britain. For this and many other crazy ideas and false promises the Lib Dems have been wiped off the political map and now UKIP, by vote, are the third largest party in the UK.</p>  <p>It is an absolute fact that UKIP had to increase the number of votes received in 2010 for the Tories to have had any chance of winning in 2015. As UKIP got 3069, a 353% increase, it was always clear to me, if UKIP did not win, the Tories winning would be the next best thing. As the Lib Dems, Labour and the Greens are all EU parties, it is with particular pleasure that the Labour and Greens helped to remove the Lib Dems and that they contributed to getting the EU referendum.</p>  <p>UKIP wants the UK to remain the UK, as an independent country run by Westminster; regaining our freedom from an oppressive foreign rule from Brussels. So this election has brought Saving the UK one step closer and I am proud to have contributed to this end and the Tories have now promised give the UK its EU referendum.</p>  <p>There is no way that Tania Mathias can break this referendum promise to the British people, as it is now set in stone, an EU referendum in 2017, or the Tories are total liars and would never be trusted again. But while we are on the subject of trust, I would like to know one other thing from Tania and after helping to get her elected, I deserve to know. During the election she made an absolute commitment to stop Heathrow, so will she join Zac Goldsmith in promising to resign if Heathrow expansion goes ahead?</p>  <p>I have been promised an EU referendum, so I was happy to help, but I also witnessed a promise from Tania of No to Heathrow; so is Tania going to do the honourable thing like Zac??</p>

    <p>Sad for Vince as he was a superb representative for the Borough but also glad for Tania as I believe she will be a worthy replacement. Very glad UKIP didn&#39;t get the 128 MP&#39;s suggested by Barry&#39;s website, but that was never going to happen in the borough when he received 5% of the vote.</p>
