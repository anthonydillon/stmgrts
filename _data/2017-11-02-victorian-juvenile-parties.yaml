    <p>It&#39;s interesting that wine should be served at such parties. Just how much wine were kiddies encouraged to imbibe?</p>

    <p>I&#39;m not an authority on the drinking habits of Victorian children but I would have thought that it was 95% water plus a splash of wine to colour it. When I was a kid my favourite party drink was Port and Lemon - 95% Lemonade plus a small glug of port for effect. I felt very grown-up after a few of those.</p>
