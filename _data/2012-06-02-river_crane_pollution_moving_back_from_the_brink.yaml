    <p>The Richmond Environment Trust reports from the River Crane: &#39; . . Some of the younger members of our group also did some kick-sampling to see what invertebrates they could find. It was encouraging to observe that they found such things as a water scorpion, mayfly nymph, caddis fly larvae, and the usual freshwater shrimps. It is also evident that the fish population is rebounding, as the river is alive with shoals of tiny fish . . &#39; <a href="http://etrutvolunteering.blogspot.co.uk/">etrutvolunteering.blogspot.co.uk</a></p>
