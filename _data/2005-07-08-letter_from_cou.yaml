    <p>&#39;extending it&#39;s recycling programme&#39; ???<br /> Why did it take the council 4 months to say no to St.Margarets?<br /> Why did you support the idea and go quiet when the council said no?<br /> Recycling is important to me my children and my grandchildren.<br /> A council re-think is required councillor.</p>
