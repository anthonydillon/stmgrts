    <p>&#39;extending it&#39;s recycling programme&#39; ??? Why did it take the council 4 months to say no to St.Margarets? Why did you support the idea and go quiet when the council said no? Recycling is important to me my children and my grandchildren. A council re-think is required councillor.</p>
