    <p>I would like to see our Council to show support of their local traders by easing parking restrictions (and costs).  Maybe we could see the return of the dotted yellow line when you could park for short periods free of charge out of the rushhours.</p>  <p>The incentive would be there to encourage people passing by to pull up and shop, rather than go to the retail parks which offer ample and free parking.</p>  <p>Many a time I have driven down Crown Road wanting to go to one or more of the shops, but finding nowhere to park, have driven off.</p>

    <p>I am guessing that Parvinu ate Nosh&#39;s lunch (as it were). But a picture gallery, the second-hand car place and a furniture shop have all closed down Crown Road recently - though something is haoppedning in the former Chase Buchanan.</p>  <p>The sentiment to support local shops is a good one.</p>

    <p>Let&#39;s remember to buy what we can at the local shops e.g. fruit &amp; veg from Carlos and the paper froma newsagent rather than Tesco!</p>

    <p>Agree with the above comments.  There is a petition in Armstrongs objecting to the  new parking restrictions the Council are planning to bring in which Let&#39;s all support the local shops now.  Could we be getting a proper bakery at long last?  we were promised one when Koblers was taken over but it never materialised.</p>

    <p>A proper Bakery on the old Kobler site would have brought more shoppers to the area than this appeal.<br /> Lamentably, in 2007/8 only two of the traders send objection comments to the planning applications that resulted in the loss of the only Bakery in St Margarets.</p>  <p>I hope the appeal will have the desired affect.</p>

    <p>Carlos tells me that due to the proximity of Tesco his business has increased - so that&#39;s something. The loss of Nosh is very sad.</p>

    <p>Marilyn&#39;s post seems a little contradictory. If there were no parking places in Crown Road when she wanted to park there, there might be fewer still if the cost was lower or if people were allowed a free 30 minutes.<br /> What she seems to be asking for is more spaces - which might be possible if bays in the side roads were converted to dual use. I noticed in secondary shopping areas in Kingston that spaces on the main street were kept for paying but the first few in side roads operated as free for 30 minutes. Is that an answer here?</p>

    <p>Trevor has highligted a flaw in marilyns post that<br /> can not be argued with.<br /> I think we need to rewind to find why small Traders in St Margarets need help in order to survive and who is in a position to provide assistance.</p>  <p>Increasingly high rent demands by freeholders and high business rates and other costs levied by the<br /> council on small businesses translate into higher<br /> prices of goods in the shops.<br /> This is where the help for shopkeepers should come from initially - penalty rates for empty retail premises and reasonable charges by the council.</p>  <p>Inadequate numbers and costly parking provisions compound the problems for small independent traders.<br /> A significant increase can be achieved by introducing a one way system along Crown Road -<br /> Sandycombe Road.<br /> This will not be popular with residents on these Roads and Roads in between as they will inevitably<br /> have their journeys lengthened.<br /> It would also be unpopular with the council because implementation of the scheme costs money and is not in line with council policy to reduce car ownership.<br /> The latest snub from the council to local traders and residents is to sell off 2 parking bays in the St Margarets CPZ to car clubs.<br /> The bays are now marked `no parking anytime`, are<br /> right in the centre of what is called `the village`, and only 2 minutes from St Margarets Station.</p>  <p>Once parking space is maximised the bays can be used for 30 Minutes free parking using the same<br /> model as is used in the Civic Centre car park in York Street. Works well there.</p>

    <p>Sorry to pick you up, Gerhard, but I really don&#39;t think we should resent car club spaces in principle (though one can argue about the locations); they do - or should - cause people to give up second cars and hopefully deter others from purchasing cars. Which, overall relaeses spaces. As a non-car-owner and car club member, I&#39;m very glad that more spaces are being maxde available for this communitarian facility.</p>

    <p>No need to be sorry, David, you got hold of the wrong end of the stick.<br /> I am solidly in favour of car clubs!</p>  <p>My posts are in response to the plea `Save our High Street` and the insensitive poitioning of the<br /> car club bays in the heart of St Margarts shopping<br /> area.</p>  <p>I thought that installing car club cars in off street council run car parks and on private land/<br /> drives was the way forward.</p>  <p>How does the cost charged by the council to car clubs for each on street bay compare to what car clubs offer to potential private providers of off street spaces?<br /> Does any one know?</p>

    <p>The announcement of the 74 (?) extra spaces for car clubs in the Borough came recently from the Council and was part of a wider London (?Mayor-led) inititaive, so perhaps Cllr. Khosa can help out on the pricing. As to the locations, the space on Broadway Avenue is indeed a "prime" space, but I suspect that the Council have ben wise here and chosen not to put it further down the road ie. outside someone&#39;s house in view of the fierce "parochiality" (shall we say) of drivers (q.v. and c.f. !) and to avoid the inevitable predictable howls that "my space has been given to a car club car".</p>

    <p>Cllr Khosa can probably advise on the costs?</p>  <p>As to the positioning, the Broadway Avenue space is indeed a "prime" shopping space but (from the Council&#39;s viewpoint) probably sensibly located in that it isn&#39;t outside anyone&#39;s house and will thus avoid the outrage of the particular householder-motorist whose "space has been given away to a car club car!!!".</p>  <p>Just my suspicion that that&#39;s why they&#39;ve done it; analysis of where the other 70+ spaces are placed could verify or disprove it.</p>

    <p>Apologies for not coming in earlier and I do not know the details of the charges for Car Club Parking Bays but I will find out on Tuesday and revert back asap. As with the positioning of Bays this was done in consultation with ward councillors and at the forefront of our thoughts were the reasons mentioned above, in addition the feeling was that the Bays should be readily accessible and visible to the largest number of people as possible and please note neither of the Bays take up any existing "shoppers" Bays.<br /> I have been advocating Car Clubs for a number of years and believe St Margarets should benefit more than most out of this win win initiative.</p>  <p>Re the Business Rates, the Council has no input into the levels charged, this is decided by the Government and the council merely collects the Rates and passes them on to the Government though a small fixed amount does come back to the Borough.</p>  <p>In conjunction with the Borough Business Champion Cllr Geoff Acton I am currently working on a Small Business Task Group and can report, though its work remains confidential, we are actively looking at (any ultimate decision resting with the Cabinet) some of the issues and initiatives mentioned above and I will report back as soon as possible.</p>  <p>Cllr Ben Khosa</p>

    <p>I do wish that people like Gerhard Schellberg were better informed before they posted comments (more like mantras!). Does he actually have any idea of what rent and rates Nosh were paying? I am an interested party (Nosh&#39;s landlord) and it is not true that they were forced out by "Increasingly high rent demands by freeholders and high business rates and other costs levied by the council on small businesses". Their current rent was fixed in 2006 and was a small increase on the 2001 figure (less than 3% p.a) and St Margarets rates are actually quite low compared to other parts of the borough.</p>  <p>Trade could certainly have been better in SMR but Nosh&#39;s problems probably came from their decision two years ago to expand into another unit in Epsom. This required added capital and more importantly meant the proprietors couldn&#39;t both spend as much time in SMR.</p>  <p>Anyway the eagle-eyed among you will have noticed that the agents&#39; board was removed within a few days (they were Nosh&#39;s agents not mine) and watch out for a new restaurant opening shortly.</p>  <p>Easing parking restrictions would certainly help. In my local borough we have some areas where residents&#39; parking is restricted to between say  noon and 2 p.m rather than the six or seven hours restriction as in St Margarets - obviously not so good for a restaurant but helps other retailers and still prevents all day commuter parking.</p>

    <p>Unlike Mr Isaacs` s, my comment did not relate to a specific business but is my general observations on how and by whom local traders might be helped in addition to local residents support by shopping in St Margarets.</p>  <p>Mr Isaacs is correct, I do not know what rent and rates the business was paying or whether the lease<br /> was up or not.</p>  <p>Should `People like me` refrain from posting comments even though they do not have all the facts and figures?<br /> I`d say yes, because someone like Mr Isaacs will<br /> post a comment quoting chapter and verse to put the record staight (or not).</p>  <p>I am looking forward to the report from the `Small<br /> Business Task Group` Cllr. Khosa has mentioned.</p>

    <p>We do support the local business community and will continue to do so but i just wanted to make a belated response to Davids post on 27th March. For the record the second hand car dealership on Crown Road (Autobahn - proprietor, Julian Olding) was made bankrupt after defaulting on an Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA), owing me over 8k on a car he agreed to sell. The car was sold but I was never paid the money.  No sympathy for this dishonest &#39;local&#39; trader I&#39;m afraid!</p>

    <p>Re Mike Isaacs mention of enforced hours, in the latest local CPZ consultation residents were asked what hours they wanted enforced and the result is what they asked for though I take the point that small number of hours being able to deter commuter parking.</p>  <p>Re Gerhard&#39;s mention of Small Business Task Group report: The work of this Group is ongoing and concludes in June however I did make interim representations on behalf of this group to the Overview and scrutiny Committee on 23 April asking it to approve of our support for the proposals for the easement of parking charges to encourage favourable conditions for businesses. This was progressed to Cabinet and as a result of this and my personal intervention the following has resulted.</p>  <p>1        Introduction on a trial basis for the Bank holiday 25th May free parking in all borough car parks (the effects of this to be measured)</p>  <p>2        Reduced tariff on one or more days (max charge of &pound;1.00 - Low/Medium emission cars, &pound;1.50 - High emission cars) for a period (3 to 6.30pm) on one or more days of the week in the Boroughs car parks (excluding the multi storey Car Parks that currently operate evening tariffs)</p>  <p>3         Short stay reduced tariff of 10p for low emissions and 20p for high for every 20 mins (20/20) on all on street parking Bays. This should help ensure turnover of spaces so vital to local shopping parades.</p>  <p>4         Voucher scheme is to be retained for the time being, converting voucher parking to voucher and mobile phone or Pay and Display parking again helping small businesses.</p>  <p>Cllr Ben Khosa</p>

    <p>Gerhard - I&#39;m not trying to stop you from posting comments, I&#39;m simply suggesting that you do not make comments which you are unable to substantiate.</p>  <p>I note Cllr Khosa&#39;s comments regarding parking hours, but traders (and the locality in general) will continue to be adversely affected if customers are unable to park easily and cheaply. Who wants to hunt around for a parking space in order to pop into the post office or to pick up or deliver some dry cleaning, or even to go into a shop for a few groceries or a bottle of wine? I suggest the Councillor visit somewhere like Golders Green to witness the destruction through parking restrictions of what was a vibrant shopping centre (despite the proximity of Brent Cross).</p>  <p>I&#39;m usually in St Margarets every week or so and invariably notice that there are plenty of available parking spaces in roads such as Broadway Avenue and Winchester Rd. The CPZ extension has simply shifted cars to the few remaining unrestricted roads to the detriment of their residents. Extending the zone and easing the restricted hours would help all around.</p>  <p>I really don&#39;t understand the suggestion of varying parking rates for cars of differing emissions. Do we want to see companies like Jaguar Land Rover to go bust with resultant job losses?</p>

    <p>Mike, if we all had to restrict our comments to what we as individuals can substantiate there would be precious few comments posted.<br /> I base my comments on what I hear from residents and traders, read in the local press and learn from attending public meetings.</p>  <p>I suppose you can substantiate what you wrote about Noshe`s failed business plan?<br /> Perhaps not, as you wrote `...probably came from their decision...`.</p>  <p>On the parking restriction issue we seem to be in agreement. To stop all day commuter parking 2hrs would be adequate to deal with that problem.<br /> Residents of St Margarets voted for the all day option in favour of the short option.<br /> Time sensitive free parking for shoppers is an expensive option but essential and should be paid<br /> for from council tax if local residents want to keep local shops in business.<br /> Not enough custom will come from residents that live within walking distance to allow these local shops to thrive or even to survive.<br /> Linking CO2 emissions to resident parking permit  charges has no doubt influenced some residents not to vote for CPZ extension and as a result commuters, in some cases travelling many miles and thus emitting much CO2 by doing so wipe out the CO2 saving made by richmond residents at some cost, are able to park for free in St Margarets.</p>  <p>I take your point about companies like Jaguar<br /> Land Rover but probably am more concerned about many other makes of cars that are used by residents that have 2 or more young children, cars that will be in a category that attract the higher cost of residents parking permit because of<br /> their CO2 emission or, if registered before 2001,<br /> have engines with more than 1549 cc capacity.</p>  <p>Parked cars do not emitt CO2, the council should concentrate on those drivers that drive many miles to St Margarets routinely and complete their jorney by train and underground from Richmond and St Margarets station.</p>

    <p>The emission related charging, IF, nothing else has highlighted awareness of the need to change to environment friendly behaviour.</p>  <p>I will be looking with officers at the capacity for more "shoppers Bays" or Pay and displays in and around this area over the coming months.</p>  <p>Cllr Ben Khosa</p>
