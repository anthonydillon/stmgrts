    <p>Very interesting.</p>  <p>I wonder if London&#39;s traffic problems would have been reduced if his plans had gone fully ahead or if they would have just encouraged more people to drive over time causing worse congestion and pollution?</p>

    <p>Thank God that destruction of St. Margaret&#39;s never happened.  I was born in Sydney Road; (1936) -   my Grandparents lived in Napoleon Road - Gran until 1969.     It would have been awful.  It was and still is, to me, a lovely and very special area and place.    Treasured memories of walks and putts in Marble Hill Park;   rides on the swings etc. in 0rleans Gardens, Moor Park;   a punt across the River to Ham House;   trips on the River from Richmond to Hampton Court;  visits to Kew Gardens;  the Horse Show, Fair, parades etc. in Twickenham.    The list is endless  - even Concorde roaring overhead!    Deplorable is only on word that can be said for this hair-brained scheme.  I know from your Newsletter that the Residents of St. M&#39;s today enjoy what they have inherited and it should stay that way.</p>
