    <p>Unless you live directly on the river I would imagine that insurance companies are making it up as they go along to try and exact as much money as they can from people living in a so called "flood plain".</p>  <p>Try any comparison website, type in all your details, and then see how much cheaper you might get it from others, I now do it each year for car, holiday and household insurance and then pick the best deal to suit, I have saved a fortune these last 5 years by switching each year.</p>

    <p>If your property has history of a previous subsidence claim (as ours has, due to a drains problem, long before we moved there) you may unfortunately find that you are "locked in" and cannot change insurers.  Good luck!</p>

    <p>A flood risk for St Margarets may be found at <a href="http://tinyurl.com/qc85tuu">tinyurl.com/qc85tuu.</a>. Much of it is in Flood Zone 2 [&gt; .1 percent risk p.a.] and some is in Zone 3 [&gt; 1 percent risk p.a.]. These risk estimates will be raised after this year&#39;s floods so the streets of St Margarets village, for example, now in Zone 2, may be regarded as being in Zone 3. Rightly or wrongly, only future floods will decide.</p>

    <p>Check out Santander home insurance - I&#39;ve recently been informed that they may take a more enlightened view, disregarding a subsidence claims history over 5 years old.</p>

    <p>A friend, Paul Grover, of Swanage Insurance Brokers, helped us when we suddenly had a huge rise in premium, by finding a Zurich policy that gave us a tradeoff between improved home security (better locks on back doors) and the flood risk. This meant we only had a small rise in premium last year instead of a huge one. I agree switching insurers usually results in lower premiums but I think the number of insurers prepared to cover homes in flood risk areas is shrinking.</p>
