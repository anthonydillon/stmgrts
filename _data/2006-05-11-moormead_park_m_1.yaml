    <p>Parking Issue<br /> Would it be possible for Eve to elaborate on how the survey on ho uses Moormead Park is to be conducted?  What questions will be asked in particular frequency and days visits and mode of transport to the park.  What is the purpose of the visit?</p>  <p>How will this information be documented and over what period of time?</p>  <p>Landscape survey<br /> At the meeting on 9 March there was mention of a survey being conducted in the park of the following:</p>  <p>-lights<br /> -benches<br /> -bins<br /> -trees<br /> -bulbs</p>  <p>Has this survey been conducted and who by?  Am guessing it would need to be done prior to final decisions on what is required for landscaping.</p>  <p>Am thinking that the opportunity for an accurate survey has passed as most spring bulbs have completd their show.  Are we then talking about bulbs for a summer display and how will we plant them without disrupting the spring bulbs already in place.</p>
