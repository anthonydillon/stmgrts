    <p>I think Judy deserves a big thank you for organising this and then so effectively chairing it. In discussion with other people afterwards I found that a lot of people did not know about this site; amongst those who did, several did not notice the facility for &#39;logging&#39; incidents around parking outside Tesco(I quit posting only because I began to feel like a lone obssessive rather than because things had improved).</p>  <p>May I suggest that posters be put in local shop/business windows advertising the community website, that local schools/groups be asked to put a notice in their newsletters about the site, plus any other suggestions??</p>

    <p>Thank you to everybody for a stimulating and lively debate. I have sent a report to Peter for this site and to Oncom for their site (<a href="http://www.stmargarets-online.co.uk">www.stmargarets-online.co.uk</a>).</p>  <p>But my overall impression is that the biggest threats to the  quality of our lives in St. Margarets are the increase in car numbers and overall traffic growth; the Tesco factor - big stores opening branches that compete with independent stores, and the estate agent factor. Of course these all impact on other aspects of community life, but they are symptoms of an increasingly wealthy neighbourhood, which is in danger of becoming a "wealthy area" and not a "neighbourhood".</p>  <p>Let&#39;s keep the momentum going and not let St. Margaret&#39;s become just an wealthy area.</p>  <p>Judy</p>  <p>p.s. Oh, and the bloody airoplanes</p>
