    <p>There is no victory and we are being duped. The pelican crossing is still going ahead and we have been given a leave of execution. TFl is applying salami tactics. I predict that the bridge will be removed within 5 years but hope that I am wrong. There will certainly be a child fatality on a very dangerous road, if the bridge is removed</p>

    <p>Jill is absolutely right, I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t even give it 5 years.</p>

    <p>Jill is right.  Not only that but the additional toucan crossing will cause even more of a traffic log jam</p>

    <p>TFL wanted to instal a toucan crossing and remove the A316 foot bridge. After consultation with interested bodies, 90% of whom opposed the plan, TFL are going to instal a toucan crossing and remove the the foot bridge . Why bother with a consulation</p>

    <p>Cllr Alex Ehmann and I talked ( organised by Caroline Pigeon) to TfL at great length and depth yesterday.</p>  <p>The reality is TfL were proposing to install the surface level crossing and remove the Bridge at the same stroke.</p>  <p>Owing to the extraordinary community reaction to the consultation and our representations they have agreed to carry out modest maintenance works and extend it&#39;s life by 2 years. Owing to the continued pressure they further informed us yesterday that they will also carry out another study to identify further necessary works to TRY and extend it&#39;s life to 5 years. They very much emphasised the fact that this is an aspiration that MAY or May NOT be realised and consequently I must convey this fact to you accordingly. In my view (IF this aspiration is realised) we may have the Bridge in situ till around the summer of 2020.</p>  <p>TfL have conceded the original consultation left much to be desired for and infact have committed to an improved consultation prior to any final decision to remove the Bridge.</p>  <p>Cllr Alex Ehmann and I made it clear to them throughout and yesterday that our "remit" from the community was to seek a permanent and not just a temporary stay of execution.</p>  <p>We are where we are and now need to look to the future and prepare accordingly. We believe we need an organised group to carry on the fight in an effective way and therefor we invite interested people from the community to step forward. Cllr Alex Ehmann, Cllr Geoff Acton and I are as ever here to help and we can enlist Vince Cable MP&#39;s help and insight which I am sure will prove highly valuable. Cllr Ben Khosa</p>

    <p>What we need to do now is campaign to stop the Toucan crossing. It will create more traffic congestion and reduce footfall over the bridge playing into TfL&#39;s hands in 2 years time. This is a cynical tactic to divide and conquer.</p>

    <p>Mary We took your point of increased traffic jams up with them. They said with careful phasing of all junctions it could result in a more free flow of traffic. Far be it for me to defend TfL but on this point I think they could be right but we wait and see. Alan We have approx 2 to 5 years to plan our response and explore other avenues. Cllr Ben Khosa</p>

    <p>I noticed that the St Margarets Community Website was listed as one of the 14 statutory bodies/stakeholders which responded to the consultation and one of the 4 of those supportive of the scheme &#39;on the basis that the timings of the new signals are coordinated properly&#39;.  Given that 90% of the 1022 individual respondents to the scheme opposed it, I wonder who this website was representing when it offered its support?  As your article notes, the scheme has been modified in response to community lobbying.  Odd that a community website takes the opposite stance.</p>

    <p>Rowena,</p>  <p>I haven&#39;t seen that; however, I didn&#39;t respond to the survey as a &#39;statutory body&#39; but as an individual.  I am very surprised (and a bit upset) that they might have done that.  I will look into it.</p>  <p>Peter</p>

    <p>Sounds like you&#39;ve been misrepresented Peter and you&#39;re of course entitled to your own view!  Interesting to see who else TfL has singled out as a representative stakeholder though.</p>

    <p>I am glad the needs of those who have mobility issues have been recognised and a pelican crossing installed. Once done so further pedestrian crossing studies will show that the bridge can be removed</p>

    <p>Well done to the ladies who spoke at the Your Vision for St Margaretsat the "Turks Head Pub" last night, and never got a positive answer to their questions, has anyone ever thought of asking the L.B.R.U.T. for a copy of the survey or structural report of the A316 footbridge so an independent person/persons can have it evaluated ?</p>
