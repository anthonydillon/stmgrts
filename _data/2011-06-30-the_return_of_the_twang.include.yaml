    <p>I remember Des had a stooge in the audience,could have been Jack Douglas,he heckled Des who replied Your mother wondered who your father was,looked at her underwear &amp; read St Michael! Or something like that</p>

    <p>Another Twang Fan! According to that night&#39;s programme Kathy Kirby was supposed to be on the bill but I seem to remember  that she had been replaced by Clyde McPhatter, the former lead singer with "The Drifters". Does this ring a bell with you Bob?</p>

    <p>Martyn. Doesnt ring a bell but she wasn&#39;t really popular until 1963 with Secret Love so I wonder if the red mist has drifted in!Are you refering to FP Empire or Regal Edmonton? I dont remember anyone else on the FPE bill other than Eddy,Des,Ifield &amp; McPhatter was part of the main tour,as I remember Eddy was at the FP Empire out of popularity,bet that upset Darin being overshadowed</p>

    <p>I went to see Duane at the Kingston Granada,he came on stage told the audience, Britain&#39;s Musicians Union would not let the Rebels back him, he played two acoustic numbers and then left the stage.Gene Vincent finished the show.</p>  <p>In those days the MU wanted to send UK musicians to the States in a reciprocal arrangement  but in those days we did not have many that would appeal to the Americans,this was pre Beatles,Stones etc. I was one miserable bloke that night</p>
