    <p>Well Done to the Traders I think that the hanging baskets will really enhance St Margarets. I notice Twickenham have put their  hanging baskets up today so I wonder what is causing the Council to delay the final approval. Come on Councillors Summer is comming!</p>

    <p>Finally, after waiting months, we have been given permission to display hanging baskets on council lampposts (the council have been waiting for their contractor to complete a lamppost survey). Hurrah, we thought, we can at last start this project- until 10 minutes later when we had another call from the council, this time telling us that we need to arrange for &pound;5m insurance cover for the baskets. We have asked the council why we need to cover this additional cost. The baskets are being displayed on council property and are funded by the council civic pride fund, so why are they not covered by the council insurance? This is being looked into by the council and I hope to report back soon.</p>

    <p>Richmond in Bloom to the rescue! I have recently been put in touch with Pat Schooling from Richmond in Bloom. Pat has agreed to help us with our hanging baskets and the council agree that if we use Pat&#39;s supplier then the council will insure the baskets. Thanks Pat</p>

    <p>In adopting the Barons recycling site, could you push for cardboard and plastics collection there?</p>
