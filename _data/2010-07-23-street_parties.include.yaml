    <p>Long live the street party. Though the more historically geographical (and pedantic) of us would say that St. Margarets is in Middlesex and not in the ever increasing amorphous zone that people call &#39;London&#39;.</p>

    <p>Of course the even more pedantic amongst us would point out that "Middlesex" no longer exists as a county and hasn&#39;t done so since 1965 when it was incorporated into that "increasing amorphous zone" Greater London. (O.K! O.K! Middlesex as a name still exists informally as a postal county but only the mega-pedantic ever use it.)</p>
