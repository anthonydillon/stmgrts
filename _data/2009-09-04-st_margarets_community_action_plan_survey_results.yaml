    <p>It is a pity that this meeting has been arranged for a date that clashes both with the Environment Trust&#39;s River Centre meeting in Richmond <a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/event/meeting/200705142203">www.stmgrts.org.uk/event/meeting/200705142203</a> and a meeting of the Borough Council which requires the attendance of all three ward councillors. With a bit of forethought this could have been avoided. The rota of Council full and committee meetings is fixed months in advance and published at: <a href="http://www.richmond.gov.uk/calendar_of_meetings">www.richmond.gov.uk/calendar_of_meetings</a></p>

    <p>Has Christopher Squires comment got lost? His comments are usually very informative and valuable.</p>

    <p>The Residents Survey Results Night was arranged well in advance of the meetings you mention. Anyway, it&#39;s good that there will be such a variety of community interest available on the night.</p>
