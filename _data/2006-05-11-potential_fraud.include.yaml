    <p>I have just spoken with my bank, Barclays, and cancelled my card.  Customer Services say that card details are usually used immediately.  It is advisable to cancel your existing card and get a new one with a new pin.  They also advised not using the old pin again when you change to one you&#39;ll remember.</p>  <p>The details that are likely to have been captured by a false front only relate to the card and not your account details.</p>  <p>It would be reassuring to hear if there is any truth in the rumour.  I know that  Peter is investigating at the moment.</p>

    <p>I&#39;ve worked for bank security and learned about the false front. If the camera is positioned exactly right, it will capture your card number and you keying in your PIN. They advised us that the only super safe ATM&#39;s are those at a bank itself because those are monitored by employees.</p>  <p>Having an atm outside is not safe in the slightest as it is easier to tamper with. If Tesco was smart, they would move the ATM inside where it is in sight of the employees and less risk of being tampered with.</p>  <p>Second, they should check the camera that is suppose to be installed on EVERY ATM. That captures suspicious activity and gets a clear shot of every single person who uses it.</p>

    <p>Having an ATM in St Margarets is useful facility.  However Alicia is quite right - it should be inside Tesco&#39;s, in order to minimise the security risk.  It&#39;s not only your money that is in danger but also possibly yourself.  I understand that the young lady who was threatened at gunpoint in Broadway Avenue a few months ago, had just withdrawn cash from that particular ATM. It will be interesting to see whether Tesco appeal against the Council&#39;s decision not to allow them to have a second exterior ATM.</p>

    <p>A second one is only asking for more trouble. The theif could be pretending to use the second one and waiting for the victim to show up to the first atm. Not only is your money at risk, but some robbed me and took my entire wallet. If you carry your social security card, drivers licence, credit cards, or other forms of ID with your information on it, you run the risk of identity theft.</p>

    <p>Bear in mind that during opening hours, you can get cash over the counter from the Post Office for free using your cash card.</p>  <p>This not eliminates a fraud risk, but also helps support a threatened local service</p>  <p>As far as the internal ATM is concerned, a number of people did object to the ATM being installed externally (mainly on the grounds of people stopping in the bus stop to get cash) - This was rejected by the Council, and the ATM was allowed outside, on the grounds that it would not increase traffic congestion on that stretch - Somewhat ironic.</p>
