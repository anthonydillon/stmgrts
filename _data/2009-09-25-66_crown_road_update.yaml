    <p>Today (30th September) a man was seen moving his clothes and personal effects into the property.  If occupancy of any of the bedsits constitutes a breach of planning law then it appears that this may have now happened.  I have been in contact with the Planning Enforcement team and been told that Richard Carter is the person likely to be investigating the property.</p>
