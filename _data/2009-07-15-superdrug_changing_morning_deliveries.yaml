    <p>busy body do-gooders are what brings this country to its knees. perhaps asking parents not to use cars at all to take their precious "i don&#39;t want to walk" chidren to school (thereby causing so much more congestion and pollution than 1 superdrug lorry) would be a much better use of time??</p>

    <p>Thank you Nigel for tackling this with Superdrug. The overwhelming majority of children in St Margarets walk to school and the lorries were extremely dangerous as cars turning left couldn&#39;t see the children (or adults) crossing.</p>

    <p>Busy body do-gooders?  There have been only 4 injury accidents involving pedestrians on St Margarets Road in the last 3 years.</p>  <p>Two at the top of Amyand Park Road. One, a person boarding a bus. One, a small child knocked over by a car turning left into Broadway Avenue (according to the report, injured seriously).</p>  <p>That is the reason I don&#39;t want those lorries and cars there, so people can cross that road in relative safety.</p>  <p>Sorry, Fred, but if I can prevent just one accident, I will keep on at these people.  Because I hope to God it&#39;s not one of my children (who, incidentally, walk to school that way every day).</p>

    <p>I agree with Fred on this one.</p>  <p>let&#39;s get the lazy parents and children out of cars and walking to school, no wonder some kids (and parents) are so fat these days.</p>  <p>A solution would be for parents to teach their offsprings simple pedestrian road safety, as those that do walk are usualy on mobiles and ipods oblivious to anything or anyone around them, therefore contributing to their own downfall.</p>  <p>Businesses like Superdrug/Tesco&#39;s  must be allowed to deliver goods at any time to satify the demand of the people of St Margarets, if not they could go elsewhere, and leave the "Village" to become  just estate agents shops and nothing else.</p>  <p>As a pensioner I welcome the convenience of a variety of shops, lets hope they are here to stay, in future can all the do-gooders start thinking outside the box, I don&#39;t have a problem with looking left and right and left again before crossing the road, at nearly 70 I have survived OK.</p>  <p>One question I would like to know if anyone has the answer for, is, where does the term "St Margarets Village" come from, My wife was born here and it only states St Margarets on her birth certificate, is it a new statement invented by newcommers of 20 years ago to push up the price of property, here is an explanation of a village from the tinternet "Although many patterns of village life have existed, the typical village was small, consisting of perhaps 5 to 30 families."</p>  <p>Thats my Victor Meldrew bit done, over and out!!.</p>

    <p>Re "St Margarets Village"": this was an estate agent&#39;s invention, signifying originally just the area between St Margarets Rd and Moormead, the railway and the A316; it is now applied more loosely to "Greater St Margarets" which runs from Railhead Road down to Richmond Road, i.e. all those roads whose commuters use St Margarets station instead of Twickenham or Richmond.</p>

    <p>I don&#39;t see where Fred or Alsie are coming from here. Well over 90% of children do walk to teh primary  schools. Even at Orleans Park the number being ferried by parents is minimal. Keep up the good work, Nigel.</p>
