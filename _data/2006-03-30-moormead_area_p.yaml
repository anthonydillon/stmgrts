    <p>THe parking in this area is extremely dangerous.  Many children cross the railway footbridge and walk along to St Stephens School - it is necessary most mornings to walk out into the road to get past the cars who park out past the ends of the side roads and so tight to other cars that you cannoit walk between.  MAny of the older children walk in gorups by themselves and the cars create an unnecessary danger.  Strangely in the Beaconsfield/AMyand PArk Road area where I live, cars parking on the ends of roads have frequently been ticketed by the parking wardens - I wonder why this is only done on one side of the railway line!!??</p>

    <p>The Officer made the Council&#39;s attitude to Parking Controls in the Moormead area very clear. RUTC will ensure a NO vote by including the area North of the A316 which has completely different problems from the Moormead area. If they are persuaded to look at a smaller scale they will say "Yes, you can have parking control,but, we will have to instal yellow lines at every corner reducing capacity by about 100 spaces in yout area. You can choose"( To find this out is going to cost us all &pound;75,000) Dare I say it, Cole park Road should not be a CPZ. Every house has a garage &amp; a drive. It is effectively a private road maintained at public expense. A large number of commuters, police &amp; sorting office staff now park on Moormead. Cole Park Road could cope far better. Let&#39;s share the misery.</p>

    <p>If there is a CPZ in the Moormead area, then commuter parking will switch over the A316. Orchard Road and St Peter&#39;s Road already have problems. It is essential, therefore, that those north of the A316 are consulted, albeit perhaps with a different question, such as if there is a CPZ there (Moormead) do you want one here.</p>  <p>The loss of spaces near corners is possibly the most difficult issue. The traffic engineers always try to insist on 5 to 10 metres. I tried to get them to agree to about three metres (slightly less than the white hatched areas) in this area as a compromise, for consultation purposes.</p>  <p>You could ask for the CPZ to be part of Cole Park Road CPZ rather than on its own or part of St Margarets. This would enable some overflow onto Cole Park Road to compensate for loss of spaces. Whether it would be enough I do not know.</p>  <p>However, as I said previously (in an earlier string on this subject) there also needs to be something innovative such as a car sharing scheme in the mixture if the evening problems are to be resolved.</p>
