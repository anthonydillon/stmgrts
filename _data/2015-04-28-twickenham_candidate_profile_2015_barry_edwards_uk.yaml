    <p>A UKIP environmentalist.  Now I&#39;ve seen it all!</p>  <p>If this is the guy I think it is, who I spoke to at the stall on the high street just before the local council and European elections, he is an ex-Tory councilllor.  He said they were only fielding one candidate for councillor in the ward (him) because they didn&#39;t want to undermine the Conservative vote too much.  Odd.</p>  <p>Does anyone really care about his O-level and A-level grades?</p>

    <p>Daniel,</p>  <p>As a qualified Environmentalist it is natural for us to be attracted to UKIP, as it is the only party that cares about the natural world. Watch this video by Sir David Attenborough which I am happy to endorse. <a href="http://www.barryedwards.info/?page_id=56">www.barryedwards.info/?page_id=56</a></p>  <p>You may have to revisit what you think environmentalist are. I obviously could have joined the Greens, but this was out of the question, because their policies are just bonkers. Email me if you wish to know why.</p>  <p>I am not the guy you think you remember and I agree that is a rather odd thing for someone to say. I was asked for my education background by stmgrts.org.uk, so I just gave a simple CV type reply.</p>  <p>Please go to my website for my views and the UKIP manifesto.</p>
