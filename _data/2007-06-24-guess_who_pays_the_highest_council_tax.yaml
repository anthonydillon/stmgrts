    <p>I am surprised at this article as it is more of a Twickenham Online subject and the answers are well known (government grant distribution, Richmond actually being the lowest spending council per head of population, higher average housing bands, etc.). The cited article itself shows that this is not new; councils despite their best efforts have remained in the same relative positions for the past ten years. The formula for funding dictates that this so.</p>  <p>Wandsworth may be a special case; it decided to cut everything to the bone twenty years ago and also has excessive central support.</p>

    <p>Trevor,</p>  <p>Sorry, having only lived here six years, I was unaware of the trend and thought the stats interesting.  But thanks for your comment -- it does put the numbers into perspective.</p>

    <p>As a public utility company BT have the right to place equipment on the highway, however, this has traditionally been confined to the &#39;standard&#39; telephone kiosks along with their green junction boxes. I share the concerns of residents about the size of their new style kiosks and the obstruction they cause particularly in places such as the one recently installed in St Margarets. While the Planning section of the Council have given advertising consent for these kiosks officers of the Highway team have met with representatives of BT to find a solution to the problem. Following the meeting the Council is hopeful that BT will voluntarily remove those that are causing a nuisance (this includes the one in St Margarets) rather than having to take formal enforcement action.</p>  <p>Regards - David</p>
