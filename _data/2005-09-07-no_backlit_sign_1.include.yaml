    <p>No back lit sign for Superdrug! What about Tesco! Can our councillors confirm that the back lit Tesco sign will be removed and replaced with something more in keeping with St Margarets village style? I believe that this was a condition of the original planning application or am I mistaken.</p>

    <p>I am so surprised that our councillors have do nothing to resolve the problems caused by Tesco - rubbish in the street, lorries parking when and where they want, noise and all that before you mention the lack of planning permission. What is it going to be like when Superdrug and the wine bar open?</p>
