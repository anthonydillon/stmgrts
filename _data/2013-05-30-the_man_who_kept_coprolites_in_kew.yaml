    <p>I would like to say how sad it is to hear about Jungleyes death. I am indeed the person above who won that money,but you know what there is another remarkable story of a Women who had cancer who jungleyes made a crystal for,and the cancer went out of her body into the crystal and turned it black. Mandy who worked in his shop will confirm who the Women is. If you would like a picture of the above horse bone or even want to see it please contact by email. What happened to Mandy?</p>

    <p>I am saddened to hear of jungleyes passing. He employed me to work with him at St. Martin in the Fields when I was a teenager. It was a cool stall and I would occasionally ask him for a stone as a bonus, if we&#39;d had a good day!</p>  <p>I wasn&#39;t always keen to eat fruits, but he introduced me to some unusual and exotic ones ( as for the stones too )..........I&#39;ll probably never forget him sharing some Dorian with me, it stunk, but was so creamy and tasty.<br /> There was also a young lady who worked with us, I don&#39;t know if she is the aforementioned Mandy.</p>  <p>When he opened World Tree, I was no longer able to commute to Kew, but I visited the shop on several occasions and we stayed in contact for a few years.<br /> I landed a job at Wilde Ones, on the Kings road, and with the experience and knowledge that I gained from Jungleyes and my current employees, I went on to become gemologist.</p>  <p>Well I&#39;m sending my gratitude and condolences to his family, kind regards,<br /> Ian.</p>

    <p>I am Jarl&#39;s brother James Bissell-Thomas and I was very touched to find this web page based on the Obituary I wrote ( which was used as a foundation for the Telegraph) I am delighted that Adrian has confirmed the horse racing pendant. I never heard of the Woman being cured of Cancer but it comes of no surprise. We all miss Jungle terribly. We are presently working on making Appley Tower an attraction which will also  remind visitors of his life. If Adrian could send a picture of his two Amulets that Jungle made for him it would be nice to add these to the Appley Tower website when we list it online.</p>

    <p>I have a little gold ring of enchantment and have worn it for more than 15 years. I never met him, but he has touched my life deeply... when he sent me the order he sent a little extra gift in response to a song on a cd of my music..."give me the moon in a silver bowl", he sent a tiny silver bowl with a crescent moon stamped in it, so very kind and personal,and I feel sad to hear of his passing.Because of that shop and his energy I have been studying and working with runes for 20 years.Thank you, Jungle brother.</p>
