    <p>I feel that this is an excellent idea! Safe play areas are very restricted in the greater London area. This is god-send for parents especially during the long cold and wet spells. This idea ensures that children can play freely and get the excercise we all so desperately need. Combating apathy and obesity, promoting play and social interaction will boost our childrens confidence and facilitate their successful intergration into society. It also allows mums that feel so isolated during a childs early years to meet with others and share ideas and develop new friendships. My commendations on your fantastic idea and the all very best for future success in this field!!!</p>

    <p>I think this is an excellent idea and must be welcomed by all with young families in the area.  Although my own children are now grown up I would have been delighted if such a facility had existed when they were small.</p>

    <p>Sorry but obviously the person who wants to start this Business at this location hasn&#39;t done their research properly. They want to put a children&#39;s "New Soft Play Space" actually into an industrial park where there are numerous large vehicles from Mears sometimes moving at dangerous speeds throughout the site during the day.</p>  <p>The assumption "A large portion of the area around the site consists of small families with high incomes, many of which can walk to the site" is rubbish because as we all know most people will drive and thus try to park down the over congested Moor Mead, Kenley, Godstone and Sidney Roads. Also what happens if it&#39;s raining how many people will you see walking? I like the idea but be serious on location, 6-16 parking spaces is laughable for 200 children. I live down Moor Mead Road and I can&#39;t think of a worse place for it, the access alone to this site is not capable of handling 200 children a day the amount of cars coming down Drummond Place and having to turn around is bad enough as it is without a constant assault from the 4&#215;4 brigade.</p>  <p>Having worked on an industrial park you can see quite clearly from the early stages it&#39;s not a place for kids to be running around. Also knock on effect to residents to try and park when they get home from work will be quite dramatic. If it did happen then I would want to see all roads around the site given residents only parking thus forcing people to actually walk. Good Idea, very bad location.</p>

    <p>The application is for change of use from industrial to soft play area.  This application does not apply to the whole estate merely to the Unit. Let there be no doubt that the site remains an INDUSTRIAL SITE. It is totally unsuitable for the type of business proposed.</p>  <p>There is already a considerable amount of movement in and out of the estate.  Mears&#39; fleet of 40 vans plus vehicles from the other businesses.  There is insufficient parking for the local residents let alone for the cars of parents visiting the site with the children.  All the toing and froing, congestion and mayhem poses a serious threat to the safety of the children walking to the estate.</p>  <p>Anti-corrosive substances and paint is sprayed on the forecourt during the summer months inviting a further health risk to the children.  This on top of the fumes coming from the traffic on nearby major roads and side roads. The congestion will contribute to what is an already polluted area.</p>  <p>Snakes and Ladders is extremely busy with upwards of 400 children at any one time.  The site has been given a huge profile and attracts families far and wide, not just locally - it has become a destination location. Syon Park can however bear the patronage as it sits on a huge expanse of land, provides ample car parking and is not a densely populated residential area. If the St Margarets play centre were to go ahead I foresee far reaching problems that will have a negative impact on the lives of the local community.</p>

    <p>I can only echo some of the thoughts of my fellow residents who state clearly the case against this proposal. The parking in the area is already verging on the intolerable and the other businesses in the area do not make a good match for a childrens play area.</p>

    <p>I am  a local resident, and a father of two small children. I live 10 minutes walking distance from the proposed site and think it is a much under served area considering the large number of children in and around St.margarets. During the cold and wet winter months such a place as this can be a god send for local families with energetic pre-school children. I also wholly support the plan for the cafe to serve healthy food only. The central location of this site makes it extremly appealing and easy to walk to, myself and my family look forward to taking our children to play there in the future</p>
