    <p>New readers may wish to look at &#39;CPZ Results Published&#39; at: <a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2007/07/cpz_results_published.html">www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2007/07/cpz_results_published.html</a> to see the result of the survey. Most streets were clearly against but 6 were in favour:</p>  <p>&#39;Bridge Road 54%; Broadway Avenue 89%; Kenley Road 67%; Winchester Road 73%; Orchard Road 54%; St Peters Road 70%; Cumberland Close 55%&#39;</p>  <p>The Council is trying to find a way of helping residents in these streets, which the ward councillors promised to do at the last election. Residents of other roads may prefer the status quo but they should at least try to understand the point of view of those who have been asking for a CPZ for many years.</p>

    <p>The St Peters Road statistic interests me. I thought that most houses on that road had driveways. Checking with Google Maps: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2x5mdb">tinyurl.com/2&#215;5mdb</a> this certainly seems to be the case. I wonder why this road voted in favour of a CPZ?</p>

    <p>Railshead Road has also voted for a CPZ and like St Peters Road has been denied inclusion to stage 2 consultation.</p>  <p>Many of the properties in St Peters Road have adequate off street parking but commuter parking to often makes the driveways inaccessible. Unfortunately the images on google have been captured early morning, most likely at an weekend. (no sign of activity on the Brunel site, Old Deer Park Car Park fairly empty and football players on pitches on the Old Deer Park.) An image taken around 10am Weekdays would probably reveal the reason for St Peters Road voting for a CPZ.</p>

    <p>Well speaking as someone who has lived for several years now in a  local CPZ, this is only history repeating itself with the Lib Dems. The residents of my CPZ were canvassed for their views beforehand but the results of the consultation were never made available, despite several of us asking for them.</p>  <p>Indeed all requests, in writing, to ward councillors and the planners, for information about how the consultation had been carried out, what were the the results of the voting and the background to the decision to make our area into a CPZ, were totally ignored. Trying to phone the councillors concerned just got you an answerphone message and they never got back to you.</p>  <p>It was not long afterwards that two Conservative councillors were elected locally.</p>  <p>Ken Livingstone has discovered that while having a consultation might be a legal requirement there is no similar legal requirement to take account of the result if you don&#39;t like it, hence the new Congestion Zone in West London, soundly opposed by the majority of local residents in two polls.</p>  <p>Ken L keeps saying if you don&#39;t like what I am doing vote me out. Maybe Councillor Twigg needs reminding of this. I suspect he is being "wound up" by the planners who seem to have the upper hand over Councillors in many areas.</p>  <p>I take it the story is going to reach the local press?</p>  <p>Regarding St Peter&#39;s Road, it must be a very specific local problem - commuters parking. I had occasion to visit Ailsa Road for several weeks in succession two or three times a week, recently and it did not seem very congested to me. As you say nearly all the houses around there have parking bays and some have garages.</p>

    <p>The Google map link in my previous post seems to have become corrupted, here it is again in full:</p>  <p><a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;time=&amp;date=&amp;ttype=&amp;q=st+peter&amp;%2339;s+road%2C+twickenham%2C+uk&amp;sll=51.462253%2C-0.584844&amp;sspn=0.009612%2C0.012832&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=h&amp;om=1&amp;ll=51.460461%2C-0.317136&amp;spn=0.001202%2C0.001604&amp;z=19&amp;iwloc=addr">maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;time=&amp;date=&amp;ttype=&amp;q=st+peter&#39;s+road,+twickenham,+uk&amp;sll=51.462253,-0.584844&amp;sspn=0.009612,0.012832&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=h&amp;om=1&amp;ll=51.460461,-0.317136&amp;spn=0.001202,0.001604&amp;z=19&amp;iwloc=addr</a></p>  <p>The purpose of checking Google Maps was to see if my belief that the majority of houses on this street had driveways was correct -- the images seem to back this up. I also question the assertion that it is commuter parking that is the problem on streets such as this. I have had to park on St Peter&#39;s road and neighbouring streets on numerous occasions when I&#39;ve been unable to park on my own street (which unfortunately doesn&#39;t have any off-street parking facilities). So maybe my legally and considerately parked &#39;residents&#39; vehicle has incorrectly been assessed as a &#39;commuter&#39; vehicle?</p>  <p>But to address the original point -- I believe that the behaviour of our elected councillors in this regard has been disgraceful if these reports are accurate. Maybe I&#39;m being naively idealistic but the councillors are elected by us to represent us -- not to do as they please with total disregard for the community.</p>

    <p>The St Margarets page on the Twickenham Lib Dem website [http://www.richmond.libdems.org.uk/pages/smnt.html] states: &#39; . . The next stage is for this information to be assembled into some zoning by the traffic engineers and with the help of a local representative working party the proposals will be put to residents as a second consultation in the near future. It needs to be emphasised that there is no intention to impose a CPZ on any road where there is a majority against it.&#39;</p>  <p>It is unfortunate that the Comments from which this is taken has been delayed so that residents have not yet received it. Nonetheless it seems plain enough. I believe that Kim Thomas lives in Orchard Road, which voted in favour of a CPZ [yes = 54 %] so it is not surprising that her road is included in the second round.</p>  <p>The Council website describes the 2<sup>nd</sup> stage consultation thus:</p>  <p>&#39;Stage 2 A consultation document and questionnaire is sent to residents and businesses within the revised consultation boundary.  Residents have 21 days to respond. The Council analyses the responses to decide on the need for controls in the area. The Council reports the results to the ward councillors and then to the TCG. Based on the results and Council officers recommendations, the Cabinet Member for Traffic, Transport and Parking either approves or decides against the statutory consultation (formal advertisement). If the statutory consultation is approved, the proposals are formally advertised (posters on lighting columns and an advertisement in the Richmond and Twickenham Times). Members of the public are invited to write in within 21 days and all representations are reported to the next scheduled meeting of the TCG. A Cabinet Member considers all feedback before making a decision on whether or not to implement the controlled parking zone. If it is decided to implement the controlled parking zone, the traffic orders will be amended, which can take up to 21 days to complete. Implementation takes place within 2 months of the traffic orders being completed. If it is decided not to implement the controlled parking zone, no further action will be taken; the project is closed.&#39;</p>  <p>See diagram at: <a href="http://www.richmond.gov.uk/first_and_second_stage_consultation_process.pdf">www.richmond.gov.uk/first_and_second_stage_consultation_process.pdf</a></p>  <p>I hope this reassure residents that the Council is not &#39;ram-rodding&#39; a CPZ down their throats but attempting, slowly and clumsily, to arrive at a solution which  will work and will supply &#39;the greatest possible good to the greatest possible number.&#39;</p>

    <p>Christopher, you might ask the people who live on South Western Road and St Margarets Grove how they feel about this?  They voted firmly AGAINST CPZ for their road and they are to be included in the Stage 2 consultation.  Is this democracy in action?  I should say not!  The truth is that CPZ will only make the parking situation in St. Margaret&#39;s worse - parking spaces will be lost by the imposition of CPZ.  I urge you to come to the meeting next Wednesday when its design is discussed.  I trust Chris Smith will repeat what he said in the meeting earlier this week - there will be fewer parking spaces under CPZ.  What St. Margaret&#39;s needs is a car park where visitors can pay to park so they can shop and support our local businesses.  And finally to suggest that the Council is merely slow and clumsy is utter nonsense, just take a look at the facts!  The process thus far has been undemocratic and conducted without transparency.</p>

    <p>The reason SW Road and St Margarets Grove are included is to give them the opportunity to change their minds and come into the CPZ when they realise that it is likely to go ahead anyway. Experience shows that streets often do change their mind in these circumstances. They cannot stop a CPZ going ahead in Winchester Road, however much they might wish to to be able to. So their &#39;least worst&#39; course of action may well be to join the CPZ and to push the problem of parking by outsiders onto someone else. A CPZ is simply a scheme to enable the residents of a particular street to privatise the parking on that street to exclude everybody else.</p>  <p>The idea of a new car park is pure fantasy. Where? Who would pay for it? Council policy is in any case to discourage the use of private motor vehicles for shopping.</p>  <p>I agree that &#39; . . [a] CPZ will only make the parking situation in St. Margaret&#39;s worse - parking spaces will be lost . .&#39;. However others do not; it is they who you have to convince.</p>

    <p>I attended the Area Consultation meeting at York House on 9<sup>th</sup> October 07 &amp; was surprised to learn that the CPZ survey for Cole Park Road was only whether they wished to be included in the new St Margarets &amp; N Twickenham CPZ &amp; not if they wanted to remain a CPZ!!  Does anyone from Cole Park Road still have a copy of the survey for comparison? Also of interest is Item D from the minutes of the Area Consultation meeting on 16th April 07 as this was before the initial consultation. CPZ&#39;s destroy community, isolate the elderly &amp; infirm, as they make it far more difficult for anyone to just drop in for a coffee &amp; a chat or to offer lifts. Also they do not solve the current parking &amp; van delivery problems. Apparently according to Cllr Morgan anyone can park in Cole Park Road when the CPZ is not in operation i.e. overnight, maybe this is how we solve the current overnight parking problem, it&#39;s not that far to walk &amp; there&#39;s always plenty of space. Also why should we allow the Council to sell our streets to National Car Parks (NCP)?</p>

    <p>Apologies for my apparent ignorance but are we talking about an extension to the existing St Margarets CPZ (Zone S) or would this be a new zone?</p>

    <p>Mike, a good question!  It took me a while to find the answer in print. LONDON BOROUGH OF RICHMOND UPON THAMES TRANSPORT CONSULTATIVE GROUP DATE:          18 July 2007 REPORT OF:     HEAD OF TRANSPORT PLANNING SERVICE LEAD OFFICER:  Mervin Bartlett SUBJECT:       ST MARGARETS PARKING STUDY ............ ....... For general release</p>  <ol> <li>  PURPOSE OF THE REPORT 1,1  To report the results of the consultation exercise undertaken during May / June 2007, seeking views from residents and businesses in the area on the "introduction" of a controlled parking zone (CPZ) in St Margarets</li> </ol>  <p>Further on in the report it says</p>  <ol> <li>  FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS 5.1  A budget of &pound;81,000 was approved by Cabinet on 10 April 2007 to cover consultation, design and implementation cost of the CPZ "extension" and to undertake a review during the 2008 financial year, should the scheme be implemented.</li> </ol>  <p>As clear as mud?</p>  <p>There is however one concelation for council tax payers.  A large chunk of the &pound;81,000 will not be spend as only one road north of the A316 is going to be included in the "extended" or newly "implemented" CPZ. At least for the time being.</p>  <p>It will be needed in the not to distant future for a new consultation that will have to be entered in to when commuters filter into roads north of the A316 and overflow parking from the large private development (brunel university site) will invade the adjacent roads to the south and west.</p>  <p>The money may even be spend earlier to make roads safe that are not a CPZ. It is not acceptable that implementation of road safety depends on whether a road is a CPZ or not.</p>

    <p>So, we have from the Lib Dems (quote): "It needs to be emphasised that there is no intention to impose a CPZ on any road where there is a majority against it."</p>  <p>Given the results of the CPZ survey, we now see if the Lib Dems can tell the truth, or ignore those who they serve.  The handling of this appears not impartial, but against those who vote for no CPZ.</p>  <p>Backing this up, I notice that 54% is given twice as "clearly voted yes" on the results page.  Is 46% a clear minority, then?.  I do not think these are responsibly described stats.  Who is my voice in the Council?</p>  <p>I echo the road safety dependency on a CPZ.  What manner of bribery is this?  Your Child&#39;s safety only matters if you implement a CPZ, otherwise they can run the gauntlet?  Draw your own conclusions there...</p>  <p>(non-CPZ voting Gordon Avenue resident).</p>
