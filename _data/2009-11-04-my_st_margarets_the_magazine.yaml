    <p>Hi Felicity,<br /> The magazine was created as a one off for Christmas but we have had such an amazing response that we are most likely to do further editions.  If you can e mail me at  <a href="mailto:%65%76%65%6E%74%73%40%73%74%6D%67%72%74%73%2E%6F%72%67%2E%75%6B">events@stmgrts.org.uk</a>, I will keep your details and let you know as soon as we are starting to plan the next magazine.  Thanks, Anita (Editor)</p>

    <p>Myself and my husband will be looking for a short term let in the St Margarets/ surrounding area&#39;s from the beginning/mid August for four months. This is due to our house being refurbished.  Ideally a 2 bedroom or 1 bedroom property.  Larger proerties would be considered.  If you know of anything please let me know !  Many Thanks Fiona</p>
