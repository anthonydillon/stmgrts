    <p>Everything these days seems to have to have a "consultation" in order to make it appear to be part of some kind of a democratic process.</p>  <p>But "The final decision on the choice of scheme/developer will be taken at the Cabinet meeting of 27 April."</p>  <p>Consultation - Schmonsultation!</p>  <p>I guess any decision must be an improvement than the last 25 years of vacuous impotent dithering however!</p>

    <p>On the Council website the three shortlisted candidates [Countryside, Quad Elmer and the Osborne group] have each provided [as large pdfs]: a layout plan, to include public realm; an artist&#39;s impression including elevation showing River Centre; and an internal view of River Centre, also showing parking and highways. The consultation will close on Mar 27. What happens next? 9-27 March - Public consultation on proposals ; 30 March - 24 April - Evaluation of proposals ; 27 April - Cabinet select a bidder with whom to further clarify, specify and fine tune the tender ; 28 May - Council decides to whom to award the contract ; 9 June - Earliest date for entry into contract ; July onwards - Preparation of a planning application for the scheme which will involve further consultation before and during its submission.

    <p>The Council offers you 3 options re Twickenham  Riverside Development.Turn to the back page &amp; you will see a space for comments.There- you can create a 4<sup>th</sup> option by writing;NONE OF THE ABOVE. as the majority of residents want OPEN SPACE.The Oct/Nov Council&#39;s session revealed &#39;no viable business plan&#39;existed for any scheme; this week, 4months on &amp; into recession there is still &#39;no viable business plan&#39; &amp; the major sponsor Clifden College has now withdrawn(was to provide 30% of finance)&amp; todate, no substitute.Businesses are closing down but this Council believes the proposed new 75 seater restaurant will finance Resource Centre/other services.I sense another massive debt being dumped on TAXPAYERS the loan of which to be paid over the next 15-20 yrs, just like the last time.</p>

    <p>Annie Hambidge&#39;s comments are based on incomplete and out of date information; I recommend to her careful study of:</p>  <p>1: The Environment Trust For Richmond Upon Thames&#39;s Spring Newsletter 2009: <a href="http://www.rivercentre.org.uk/etrut_spring_2009.pdf">www.rivercentre.org.uk/etrut_spring_2009.pdf</a> ; and</p>  <p>2: The report by Rob Gray and Angela Kidner of the River Centre project team to the Council&#39;s Co-ordination, Finance and Performance Commission on March 10: <a href="http://www.rivercentre.org.uk/etrut_cfpc0309.pdf">www.rivercentre.org.uk/etrut_cfpc0309.pdf</a></p>  <p>and the rest of The River Centre&#39;s website: <a href="http://www.rivercentre.org.uk/">www.rivercentre.org.uk</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps Mr Squire could list precisely what facts Annie Hambridge has got wrong, instead of just saying they are incomplete and out of date.   To my knowledge, what she says is correct.</p>
