    <p>H37 is the only bus serving the population along St Margaret&#226;&#128;&#153;s Road past St Margaret&#226;&#128;&#153;s Station over the 316 to Isleworth.  It is already an unreliable bus service in terms of regularity with gaps stretching up to 20 mins. Up to 9.30am on a morning, it is sometimes impossible to get on a bus to Richmond from the Talbot Road stop.  Additionally, it is a bus used by train passengers arriving at St Margaret&#226;&#128;&#153;s station.Similarly, buses are very full from 5pm onwards. It is inconceivable to me that tfl is proposing to reduce the frequency  of this bus when it is the only bus serving this area (compare with the number of  buses serving the Richmond Road to Twickenham and beyond route.</p>  <p>It is an important bus in the late evening particularly if one has been to the theatre etc in townand diminishing the frequency at this time makes for a cold wait in the evening.  Taxis from the station to my apartment at Richmond Lock cost &#194;&pound;10 for a very short journey.  Again older people will be most affected by this change.</p>

    <p>Apart from the fact that you are not capable of running a six minute service on the H37 most of the time, even when you do the buses are frequently over crowded and I have often seen people with push chairs left behind as they are unable to get on the bus. I use the H37 to get to / from South Street and Richmond station. There are a number of new housing developments in the Isleworth area which are only going to add to the demand. I think it is ludicrous that you should be thinking of reducing the bus frequency of an already very busy route.</p>
