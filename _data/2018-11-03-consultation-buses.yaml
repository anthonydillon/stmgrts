    <p>H37 is the only bus serving the population along St Margaret&#226;&#128;&#153;s Road past St Margaret&#226;&#128;&#153;s Station over the 316 to Isleworth.  It is already an unreliable bus service in terms of regularity with gaps stretching up to 20 mins. Up to 9.30am on a morning, it is sometimes impossible to get on a bus to Richmond from the Talbot Road stop.  Additionally, it is a bus used by train passengers arriving at St Margaret&#226;&#128;&#153;s station.Similarly, buses are very full from 5pm onwards. It is inconceivable to me that tfl is proposing to reduce the frequency  of this bus when it is the only bus serving this area (compare with the number of  buses serving the Richmond Road to Twickenham and beyond route.</p>  <p>It is an important bus in the late evening particularly if one has been to the theatre etc in townand diminishing the frequency at this time makes for a cold wait in the evening.  Taxis from the station to my apartment at Richmond Lock cost &#194;&pound;10 for a very short journey.  Again older people will be most affected by this change.</p>

    <p>Apart from the fact that you are not capable of running a six minute service on the H37 most of the time, even when you do the buses are frequently over crowded and I have often seen people with push chairs left behind as they are unable to get on the bus. I use the H37 to get to / from South Street and Richmond station. There are a number of new housing developments in the Isleworth area which are only going to add to the demand. I think it is ludicrous that you should be thinking of reducing the bus frequency of an already very busy route.</p>

    <p>The 110/419 proposal on part of the H37 route needs to be CANCELLED!</p>  <p>The main point being made by tfl is that somehow we need extra buses at this supposedly  &#226;&#128;&#152;busiest&#226;&#128;&#153; point of this short stretch  of H37 route for &#226;&#128;&#152;crowding relief&#226;&#128;&#153; this route. Supposedly <del>according to the changes tfl is proposing</del> this &#226;&#128;&#152;busiest point warranting crowding relief is BETWEEN the st Margarets roundabout and the traffic lights at the connection with Richmond road. The merged 110/419 will increase the overall number of buses  to 12 buses an hour it is claimed. But only on the stretch of H37 route from St Margarets Roundabout until it connects to Richmond road. The rest of the H37 route will go down in frequency. So relief for the H37? ONLY ON THE STRETCH BETWEEN ST MARGARETS ROUNDABOUT AND RICHMOND ROAD.</p>  <p>So as to the other comments; overall frequency of the H37 and route it services e.g. coming from Isleworth would still be reduced. And not just that but the overall punctuality and quality of the H37 would further deteriorate.</p>  <p>This is because the proposed 110/419 would on top of that arrive via the 316 and would have to turn right at the St Margarets roundabout <del>a tight and busy tight turn at the best of times</del> causing more traffic issues there. Also newly to be created busstops on this part of the 316 coming from Twickenham seem pointless leading to more traffic jams on this already busy main road. It would make more sense to have the 110/419 come down through Twickenham and take a left on Richmond road to continue. Essentially the old to be discontinued H22 route past town hall etc. It&#226;&#128;&#153;s also a completely unrealistic situation to have even more buses than the current frequncy of H37&#226;&#128;&#153;s PLOUGH their way through this thin part of St Margarets Road was that is the stretch from St Margarets Station until it&#226;&#128;&#153;s connecrion with Richmond Road. We live on this part of St Margarets Road and it&#226;&#128;&#153;s way too small and thin for two way traffic with cars parked on both sides. IT CANNOT HANDLE EVEN MORE BUSES. Everyday traffic gets stuck here or has to wait for the other side to pass. Regular knocking off parked car&#39;s wing mirrors or causing scratches by buses and large vehicles is an unfortunate result. Buses or lorries having to stop and edge past each other as the road is so narrow and holding up traffic, and already with tail backs from the lights at Poplar Court I don&#39;t think this stretch of road can stand any more traffic, let alone buses. In short the whole new plan regarding the H37 changes combined with the ridiculous and inefficient new proposed route of this merged 110/419 route should be CANCELLED. We DO NOT NEED more buses per hour on this TOO THIN stretch of St Margarets Road.</p>  <p>These plans are a typical example of being drawn up by a detached planning department without ever having considered the real life impact of them on street level.</p>
