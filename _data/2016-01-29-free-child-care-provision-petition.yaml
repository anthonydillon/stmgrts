    <p>I seem to remember being promised something similar by Blair/Labour, but our children never benefitted from it because "they were born too late in the academic year" - once again the September/October birthdays benefitting at the expense of everybody else (and as they continued to do all down the line through prinary education with so-called "gifted and talented" and wotnot). My cynical advice to future parents, only procreate between January and March.</p>  <p>By the way, the pledge is explained here - <a href="http://www.employersforchildcare.org/news/article/camerons-30-hours-free-childcare-pledge-explained">www.employersforchildcare.org/news/article/camerons-30-hours-free-childcare-pledge-explained</a> - give thanks that you don&#39;t live in NI.</p>
