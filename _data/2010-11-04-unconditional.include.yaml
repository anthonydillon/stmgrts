    <p>Agreed. It seems to me that it is the local history series that has vanished, which is a great loss - but I did wonder where the material was coming from. It is a pity that authors of obscure books and pamphlet persist in asserting their copyright in works which bring them little or no income, when the same material, if turned into web pages, would delight and interest 1000s of readers down the years.</p>  <p>A huge amount of work has been done by the Local History Society, for example, which has only been published in now out-of-print pamphlet that few residents ever see.</p>  <p>My editorial policy (as editor of the borough&#39;s Lib Dem site <a href="http://www.richmondlibdems.co.uk">www.richmondlibdems.co.uk</a> ) is to borrow freely but to take care to acknowledge sources and to link to to original websites wherever I can; and to remove pages or images where copyright is claimed without demur but without any admission of wrongdoing.</p>  <p>Images are more of a problem than words. Getty Images, in particular, are vigilant, using automatic search tools, in protecting their claimed copyright over and claiming fees for even the most everyday image. However they have never taken anyone to court so prompt removal of the image is all that is needed to satisfy them.</p>

    <p>Having checked, I see that Martyn/Marytn Day&#39;s excellent local history articles are still on the site. What has been removed I don&#39;t know.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;newwindow=1&amp;safe=off&amp;&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EyHVTLz8F86OjAeOk6zbCQ&amp;ved=0CBQQBSgA&amp;q=%22martyn+day%22+site%3Astmgrts.org.uk&amp;spell=1">www.google.co.uk/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;newwindow=1&amp;safe=off&amp;&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EyHVTLz8F86OjAeOk6zbCQ&amp;ved=0CBQQBSgA&amp;q=%22martyn+day%22+site%3Astmgrts.org.uk&amp;spell=1</a></p>

    <p>Ben,</p>  <p>While the volume of work does get to me at times, I am not ready to shut it down.</p>  <p>Chris,</p>  <p>I wasn&#39;t referring to Martyn.  We are very lucky to have him contributing and he works hard, often with help, researching all of his articles himself.  Several of his pieces have been picked up for radio, other sites and the My St Margarets magazine as well.  He is the perfect model of someone who shares and reuses his work and I think both of us are happy.</p>  <p>It doesn&#39;t really matter which persons or which articles/photos where taken down, it is the spirit and purpose and archival issues that concern me.  But I agree with your editorial policy.  That is exactly the spirit that the WWW was founded under, that is how sites like Google rank, etc... sharing with attribution (with links).</p>  <p>Peter</p>
