    <p>What is the status of Moormead Park? What is its relationship to Hillview Road?</p>  <p>What is your opinion about the conversion of the 1m strip from park to pavement?</p>  <p>Too small to matter? Good for the health and safety of pedestrians? Encroachment into park land?</p>  <p>Hmm, that&#39;s a lot of questions. A couple more for good measure. Is this LBRUT Transport and Streets dept. or LBRUT Parks and Open Spaces dept. doing this? Are the Friends of Orleans Park aware?</p>  <p>Interested to hear from others. Thanks to StMgrts.org for bringing it to my attention.</p>
