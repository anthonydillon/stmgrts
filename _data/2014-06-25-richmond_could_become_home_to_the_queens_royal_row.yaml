    <p>SAVE THE ST MARGARETS FOOTBRIDGE CAMPAIGN UPDATE:</p>  <p>News just in. Our councillors have secured a TfL site visit for 3pm on Tuesday 15 July at the St Margarets Crossing site. While this is to discuss the proposals with ward councillors rather than a public meeting (per se), our councillors are keen for fellow campaigners to join the visit if they&#39;d like - so you can hear what TfL have to say. The force of the community campaign has also resulted in a consultation extension until July 18th. So, if you haven&#39;t already had your say on the proposal please visit TFLs website.</p>  <p>At the same time, Our councillors have been busy talking with other cross-party campaigns for improved cycling facilities in the borough to gain their support and lobby them to oppose the proposal.</p>  <p>Finally, the petition is to be delivered to the GLA later this month and the Liberal Democrat Assembly Member, Caroline Pidgeon, will submit it for consideration.</p>  <p>A big thank you goes out to everyone who has put this campaign on the map.</p>
