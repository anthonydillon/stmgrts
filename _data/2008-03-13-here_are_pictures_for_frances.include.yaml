    <p>HI there, I&#39;m in Melbourne, Australia, back here now for 2 years, but really really missing the walk from Haliburton Rd to the Town Wharf, or up past the Europa(now a Tescos I read!) to  the Arms. I&#39;m chuffed to find a site dedicated to the nicest part of London I lived in in the 15 years I worked over there. It&#39;s the only part of London I would actively want to return to. Cheers, j/xx</p>
