    <p>PC Richens will be holding his police surgery in Zorans on Wednesday between 1pm and 3pm one of our newly elected local councillors will be with him so perhaps we could raise this problem with them.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately a lot of us work during the week, so will be unable to meet our PC.</p>  <p>Perhaps he could bring one of these false-fronts along to show people - it was so good, I was ever-so-nearly taken in by it.  But now I&#39;d be able to spot one a mile off.  Education, education, education...!</p>  <p>But the banks could help - instead of a simple blue-and-white Royal Bank of Scotland logo beneath the card slot, if they replaced it by a complex holographic one that cannot so easily be reproduced, it would keep the fraudsters at bay for a while (at least, until they obtain a machine to forge the logos, that is!).  In the longer term, the cards all now have a chip on-board so there&#39;s no real need for that pesky magnetic stripe which can so easily be copied.</p>

    <p>Taking money out at the Post Office is free (effectively it is a LINK cash machine) - The Tesco ATM drove a lot of custom away from the Post Office (who had themselves been told not to bother applying for planning permission for an ATM because it would never be allowed in St Margarets - Until Tesco, of course!) -</p>  <p>Taking money out there, even if there is a small queue, helps save a valuable local resource.</p>  <p>If you are around out of hours, I believe Broadway Stores offers cashback, unlike Tesco</p>

    <p>I too can report a fraud on my cash card. It appears that my talents have no bounds as i was able to withdraw &pound;200 from my account during half-term week at Tesco&#39;s despite being in Dorset at the same time!! You never think its going to happen to you- my bank have (so far) been helpful and I am mid way through the form filling but they did say I should be thankful I was&#39;nt the victim of an identity fraud!Now of course I need new PIN numbers etc and it is a real drag</p>
