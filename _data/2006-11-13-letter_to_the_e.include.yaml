    <p>ed you are not the only one to think where are these contractors, digging up holes in a narrow dangerous spot &amp; then abandoning it. what they should be forced to do is have a phone no. at the site so we can all nag them to get on with it!</p>

    <p>SIR</p>  <p>The Sydney RD crisis surely deserves detailed analysis/reportage by the Rich and Twick Times. I&#39;m confused abt the details myself -but tend to be on the side of the residents.</p>  <p>Perhaps - tho a regular reader - I&#39;ve missed the paper&#39;s coverage, if any.</p>  <p>I wd be happy to approach the R&amp;T abt the issue, subject to yr expanatary briefing, as time - as ever - permits.</p>
