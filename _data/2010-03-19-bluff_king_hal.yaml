    <p>Am searching fo an old children&#39;s poetry book containg poems of all the king and queens of England that contains this bluff king Hal poem. I learned to read from this book and would like to get a copy of this book to leave to an autistic nephew when I die. Any help would be deeply appreciated</p>
