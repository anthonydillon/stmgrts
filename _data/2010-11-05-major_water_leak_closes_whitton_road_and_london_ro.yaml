    <p><strong>Update as at 19.45</strong></p>  <p>A316  and London Road re-opened but only one lane over the bridge by Twickenham station.  Actual leak is where Cole Park Rd meets the bridge by the lights/roundabout.</p>  <p>According to Council engineer there buses now instructed not to detour.  They haven&#39;t  located actual leak yet and if it is further into the road they may have to re-close it.</p>  <p>There is no sign of flooding in Cole Park although there is substantial subsidence in the pavement on this corner.</p>  <p>They don&#39;t foresee much problem for tomorrow&#39;s rugby.</p>  <p>-- from Mary Ainscough</p>
