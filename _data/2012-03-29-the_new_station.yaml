    <p>Thank you Martin for more enlightment on "The Village", as you say it never has been a village and never will be, unless you are an estate agent, my wife was born here 65 years ago and all it says on her Birth Certificate is "St Margarets"</p>  <p>If it is a village, where is the idiot? perhaps you could do a slant on that topic.</p>
