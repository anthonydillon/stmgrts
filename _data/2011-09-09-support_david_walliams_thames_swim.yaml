    <p>My very unofficial progress forecast is as follows:</p>  <p>On Saturday he will reach Windsor and possibly even Staines.</p>  <p>He will pass Penton Hook (Laleham) early on Sunday morning, Walton around lunchtime, Kingston in the evening and finish up at Teddington Lock around 7pm on Sunday.</p>  <p>On Monday he will swim down from Teddington past Twickenham until he reaches Richmond Lock.  He will have to stop there and wait until the tide turns at 4pm.  That will probably be a good place to cheer him on if you get there quickly after school on Monday.</p>  <p>Once he gets back in on the ebb tide, he will go shooting off downstream towards Kew faster than a Thames Jellyfish.</p>

    <p>Some solid information:</p>  <p>He will swim to Old Windsor tonight (Saturday).<br /> Sunday&#39;s target is Kingston.</p>  <p>He will be at Teddington Lock early on Monday, on through Twickenham and down to Richmond Lock,  below there he is at the mercy of the tide and the sewage.</p>

    <p>Correction I meant to type "he will be at <em>TEDDINGTON</em> lock early on Monday, then on down through Twickenham" ...</p>
