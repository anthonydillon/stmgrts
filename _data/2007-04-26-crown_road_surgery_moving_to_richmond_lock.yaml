    <p>Delighted that the practice has had the confidence to invest in a better future and enhanced facilities for the local community. Depressed that people living in "the village" see the new location as remote. Come on people! Its only up the road. You can walk it in ten minutes; the H37 stops across the road. Leave your 4&#215;4&#39;s at home.</p>

    <p>Does anyone know whether the new surgery will be located in a purpose built building or will it be in one of the few remaining buildings on the Brunel site eg. the Old Oragery/Pavilion?</p>

    <p>I can&#39;t get through to the surgery, does anyone know if they are still in the process of moving or if they are fully installed in their new premises?</p>

    <p>Where are they moving to? I have an appointment on Monday and only just found out that they are moving - why did they not send out letters? Has their number changed? Only they aren&#39;t answering the phone.</p>

    <p>It would be great if the new surgery address and contact details were updated into the community website. As I am at a loss how to find them and contact the new surgey.</p>

    <p>All this information is well and good but you could at least include its change of phone number with all the other useless information you have posted!</p>

    <p>Hey Sam, if you think about it, I didn&#39;t have that number when I posted the article as they hadn&#39;t moved yet.</p>  <p>So if you actually looked in the local info section you would see their listing <a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/directory/doctors/200506220010">www.stmgrts.org.uk/directory/doctors/200506220010</a></p>  <p>Also, I really don&#39;t appreciate your attitude.</p>

    <p>The new surgery seems very efficient. Its nice to see also, that Richmond and Twickenham Primary Care Trust reduced its costs by 4% in 2006/7 and that the report and accounts are very informative.</p>
