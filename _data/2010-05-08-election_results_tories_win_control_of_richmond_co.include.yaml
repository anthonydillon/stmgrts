    <p>Sir,</p>  <p>Thank goodness that&#39;s all over and the LibDems are out. Maybe common sense might now have a chance.</p>  <p>I would remind people like Chris Squire that the LibDem "stir endlessley" principle is over.</p>  <p>Let&#39;s get on with life without animosity.</p>

    <p>The &#39;stirring&#39; will commence immediately and continue until the next election. That is the function of the opposition in a democracy and it is much easier and much more fun than governing, particularly in difficult times, when hard choices have to be made as to what to cut and what to protect. I am not particularly keen on doing it myself but I do believe in not letting the stirring of others pass unrebutted which seems to irritate some who are not accustomed to being contradicted.</p>  <p>However I don&#39;t feel any personal animosity towards Barry Edwards and look forward to seeing what he can do for St Margarets now that his foray to Teddington is over. He pushed up the Tory vote there by 8 <span cite="http://">, the 3<sup>rd</sup> largest increase  in the borough and a good result compared to their modest 2  increase overall; their vote share fell in 6 of 18 wards. So I wait with interest to see how his &#39;common sense&#39; manifests itself on the St Margarets stage, where the Tory vote rose by only 4 %.</p>

    <p>Sir,</p>  <p>I understand good debate; endlessly stirring may meet a political imperative, but in the real world it seems rude, inconsiderate, tiresome etc etc.</p>  <p>I thank Chris for his compliments, do you know underneath it all, I don&#39;t think any of the LibDems are inherently nasty, just a bit misguided.</p>  <p>So let&#39;s call and end to the stirring, let&#39;s within the context of the new coalition try and listen to each other, this Borough would do well from some co-operation for a change.</p>  <p>It was not an accident that there was a swing in Teddington, common sense works, community first is the way forward.</p>  <p>I don&#39;t know what I will do next, a lot of divisions have been created by misinformation, and it may be a long repairing process!!</p>
