    <p>Many Congratulations on your 40th. Anniversary.<br /> With all best wishes.         Molly Brown.</p>  <p>I know West Middlesex University Hospital so well, having worked there for the best part of fifty years.   Having said I would never work at the same hospital as where my mother worked (and in any case I wanted to be an Air Stewardes !), I came to do a temporary, summer,job for a fortnight in my School Holidays, I then proceeded to work as the Junior Secretary in the Anaesthetic Department, became the Anaesthetic Department Secretary when the former Secretary retired through ill-health soon after I started as the Junior.     After some twenty very happy years in the Anaesthetic Department (where I must admit I was thoroughly spoiled), under the guidance of Senior Consultant Anaesthetist Dr. Courtney Dunn ; I transferred to the Orthopaedic Department, and worked for Mr. Duff, for twenty years.     After retiring from full-time work,I carried on working part-time at the hospital, and also undertaking Mr. Duff&#39;s Medico-Legal  and Private Work at home, I eventually went on the Hospital Bank Staff, covering Units when required.</p>
