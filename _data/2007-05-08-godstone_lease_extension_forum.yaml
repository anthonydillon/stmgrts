    <p>The forum is not restricted to those living in Godstone Road.  I suspect there are others affected by this problem living in maisonettes on the N&amp;D estate.</p>

    <p>Maddie,</p>  <p>Thanks for this. I live in a nearby road and am in the same position, with having to give consideration for an extension of the lease but am horrified at the finances involved, particularly as my then downstairs neighbour secured an extension for much much less in 2001.</p>  <p>Perhaps if we see the numbers who are interested it may be useful to contact the lesaholder advice organisation for help and the local MP.</p>  <p>No doubt this will have been thought of.</p>

    <p>Hi Dave, we have only started out in our investigations and are aware of others who have extended leases for much less.  So far we have corresponded with the councillors and had some input from Lawrence Mann.  The difference between now and 2001 is the increase in value of the properties and the length remaining on the leases.  Perhaps what we should each do is collate the information we have so far and post this in the forum pages. Also to make more people in the area aware that an action group is being formed.  What do you think?</p>

    <p>Maddie,</p>  <p>This is the sort of thing that I have dealt with (although at a very basic level) on a number of occasions at Richmond Legal Advise Service (<a href="http://www.rlas.org.uk">www.rlas.org.uk</a>).  What I suggest to clients is that they first look at the Leasehold Advisory<br /> Service web site (<a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/http://www.lease-advice.org/">www.stmgrts.org.uk/http://www.lease-advice.org/</a>) (not the Leasehold Advisory Group which appears to be a just a collection of specialist advisers, eg<br /> lawyers, surveyors).</p>  <p>There is material on leasehold extension on the site. As I understand the position, the amount for an extension of a lease is governed/specified by<br /> law (sometimes lessors do not apply the law correctly and do not ask for the correct amount).  The LAS site includes an explanation on how this is calculated (the page headed "Valuation for Leasehold Extension - Valuation Issues for<br /> Lease Extension for Flats" - I cannot provide a direct link because of the way the site is constructed).</p>  <p>In my experience, you should first contact the Leasehold Advisory Service, but that any serious negotiations/dispute is best handled by a specialist lawyer (the LAS provides a list of solicitors - but it seems fairly generic (self selecting)). I know that some clients seen at Richmond Legal Advice Service have funded the cost of a lawyer through the use of legal expenses cover in an insurance policy (such as contents<br /> policy). Even if that is not available, then if there is a group of you, the cost could be spread.</p>

    <p>Hi Maddie<br /> I moved in to Sidney Road in Dec 2005 on a relatively short lease. In my "Report on Title" document from my solicitor I have correspondence from Grainger Trust dated 01 June 2005, noting that "their most recent lease extension was for a flat in Godstone Road which held a lease term of 66 years unexpired and this was agreed at a figure of &pound;13,500 with a reviewable ground rent provision".</p>  <p>I can supply a copy of this if this helps us all.</p>

    <p>Phil thank you for the offer of a copy of the letter dated 1 June 2005. It is in the last couple of years that the value of our properties has dramatically increased.  The hike in what Grainger Trust are now asking is related to that increase. Please do hold on to your letter, we may need it in the future.</p>

    <p>hi all - i dealt directly with N&amp;D last year as i am a Chartered Property Surveyor by profession (not an estate agent though!) and understand at least the principles behind how lease extensions should be valued!.</p>  <p>Victor is correct that matters are governed by legislation under Leasehold Enfranchisement rules but really it should be a professional surveyor and not a lawyer who does any negotiating - (values of local property are required to be assessed and i certainly would not expect a normal lawyer to be able to do this!) they should only need to get involved on final documentation matters.</p>  <p>N&amp;D&#39;s figure is very much an an "opening shot" - the end figure to be agreed upon would depend totally on each person&#39;s Lease details. as an illustration we extended ours for &pound;13,750.</p>  <p>i hope this helps.</p>  <p>as a bit of an afterthough here: would anyone be interested if i was to consider offering my services to act for them against N&amp;D (for a fee)?? - just a thought!!</p>

    <p>Maddie,</p>  <p>We live in Godstone Road as well and are faced with the same dilemma, as is our neighbour downstairs.</p>  <p>As has been noted <a href="http://www.lease-advice.org">www.lease-advice.org</a> is an excellent website. It explains how the calculation is done. The key element is the "marriage value". This is how much more the flat is worth with a new lease. The increase in value (say &pound;30,000) is then split between landlord and tenant so only half of it goes into the calculation. This is the biggest element of the price of a new lease. Of course, determining this is not an exact science and can be argued over (your surveyor/ N&amp;D surveyor).</p>  <p>The other key point is that, if agreement cannot be reached, either party can elect to take the matter to a Leasehold Valuation Tribunal. These are low-cost tribunals set up to adjudicate on these issues and their calculation - after hearing both sides - is final. Landlords rely on inertia, ignorance and inactivity on the part of tenants in not taking such matters further.</p>  <p>Jacob</p>

  comment: |
    <p>in addition to marriage value you also need to pay the Landlord for the fact that by extending your Lease he will effectively lose value on his present interest in the property (all those annual ground rents do add up!).</p>  <p>N&amp;D will negotiate because there is the ultimate sanction (if you qualify) of seeking legally an 90 yr extension to your current lease term at a nil rent. This is provided for under statute but the trade off for this is a lower premium payable than it would be under the above scenario.</p>  <p>Also N&amp;D will not want to take matters to LVT as all decisions from LVTs are put in the public domain on a website.</p>

    <p>Maddie / All,<br /> I considered extending the lease on my property in Godstone Road in early 2004. The lease was valued by Douglas &amp; Gordon on the instructions of BPT (Residential Management Services) Ltd., a Grainger company.</p>  <p>I was offered a 90 year lease extension for &pound;16,000 subject to contract and payment of Grainger&#39;s "reasonable legal fees".</p>  <p>I still wish to extend my lease and would certainly welcome an opportunity to discuss the matter with other affected parties and put some pressure on Grainger Residential Management.<br /> 30th May would be fine for me.</p>

    <p>Hi All</p>  <p>Just a little reminder about the meeting on Wednesday 30 May at 19:30, venue The Turks Head.  A table is reserved for us so guess I will be there a little earlier and place some sort of placard on the table so we recognise each other.  Some of you I will know if course.</p>  <p>Here is my punt for an agenda and not necessarily in this order:</p>  <p>Agenda<br /> Actions / discussions so far<br /> Negotiating as a group or individually - what are the advantages/disadvantages (cost, reaction from N&amp;D, etc.,) Of those present at the meeting what number of years are left on each lease?<br /> Set up of housing association. Advantages and disadvantages.<br /> Leaflet distribution dependent on outcome of discussions so far(content, printing etc.,) Likely cost of legal advice/surveys and time span to close.<br /> Resources and contacts available (surveyors/lawyers).<br /> Cadogan v Sportelli case - impact of outcome and and hearing at Court of Appeal</p>  <p>Maddie</p>

    <p>We are in the process of extending our 65 yr lease for a ground floor maisonette in Sidney Rd near Moormeads.  Grainger Trust are asking 30k for 90 yr extension. Our surveyor has rcommended 25k( to start negotiation at 23k )  Statutary application has already been made, leading potentially to LVT in New Year,<br /> if no negotiated settlement beforehand.  We are rather shocked at our own surveyor&#39;s assessment.<br /> Does anyone have any ideas or similar current problems?<br /> Michael 2</p>

    <p>Hello Maddie - we live in Cambridge and my daughter is thinking of buying the lease of her rented flat which is leased to her by a Housing Association.</p>  <p>Like your group, she would have a short, 68-year lease.  Have you made any progress since Feb 28th over this problem, as my daughter would only want to buy the lease if she could sell it soon, because she does not like it.</p>  <p>We don&#39;t mind the cost of the lease extension so much if it immediataely values the flat by twice as much extra as the cost of the extension.  However, if my daughter wishes to sell before 10 years she would have to offer it back to the Housing Associaiton.  If they wanted it, they would have to pay, in theory, a market price.  But would they pay for the much-increased value of the flat after a leasse extension?  Could they block a lease extension?  Are the properties of your group with a Housing Associaition, by and large? (The Grainger Trust sounds like one)</p>  <p>Hope you have time to reply - best wishes - Elizabeth Cary</p>

I practised at a "Top 500" law firm in Beckneham and Bromley region but I now have my own law firm, based in Beckenham.</p>  <p>I used to live in Nutfield, so I am familiar with the Godstone area. Although I now live in Biggin Hill, I am effectively just down the road, and I would be happy to attend, FOR FREE, a meeting of the residents (evening and weekends are fine) to run through the process and also answer the many qustions leaseholders no doubt have.</p>  <p>I can be contacted on 020 3326 5031 or by email at  <a href="mailto:%74%6F%6D%40%74%6A%6D%6C%61%77%2E%63%6F%2E%75%6B">tom@tjmlaw.co.uk</a>.</p>  <p>If you already have secured legal services, I wish you all the best!</p>  <p>Kind Regards</p>  <p>Tom Merralls</p>

    <p>Hi Tom</p>  <p>Thank you for contacting us.  We are quite a long way into negotiations now so will not be accepting your kind offer.  We have been moving forward with the process for almost a year now and in total 25 transactions, mostly lease extensions, not collective enfranchisement will be taking place.  However, there may be a number of residents in the area who were unable to go forward with this group who are now ready to proceed. Once again thank you. Maddie</p>

    <p>Hi Maddie</p>  <p>We live in Kenley Road and are considering extending our lease. We did contact you last year but we thought we were imminent to move and with a 76 yr lease hoped we would manange a sale. Now we plan to stay a few more years so yesterday I had a long chat with Owen Grainger. It seems that things are not great with N&amp;D in that they are playing hard ball with negotiations. The only way forward seems to be to try and start another action group. Could you kindly tell me if you are aware of any residents who did not join your group and are still in need of extending their lease?</p>  <p>Kind regards</p>  <p>Lisa Lopez</p>

    <p>Hello,</p>  <p>We are about to appoint a surveyor to either extend the lease, or buy the freehold from Grainger, for our maisonette in Sidney Rd.</p>  <p>As mentioned in other posts, we have heard that people with similar leases (65 years) have gone for 17K after originally being quoted 25K for a lease extension.</p>  <p>With this in mind, it would be good to hear if anyone has experience with the purchase of the freehold from Grainger.  Obviously we would be looking at collective enfranchisement (upper and lower properties), and preliminary enquires are coming in at between 8-12K.</p>  <p>Any experience and comments gratefully received.</p>  <p>Thanks,</p>  <p>Kat</p>
