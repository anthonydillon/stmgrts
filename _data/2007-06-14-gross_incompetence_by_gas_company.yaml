    <p>Rather than another estate agents, wouldn&#39;t it be nice to see the old bakers on Crown Road turn back into another food shop or local retailer(something that would serve the needs of the local community). We would question the direction of local planning; is it really to convert St. Margaret&#39;s village centre into yet another Estate Agents Ghetto? These have become the blight of so many of our charming village centres. There are already far too many offices and far too few local shops.</p>

    <p>The direction of local planning is to oppose change of use from retail to service. It is the rents offered by Estate Agents which go in the other direction (but come a downturn in the market they will leave behind empty shops, as Chris Squire suggests elsewhere). It is up to us to complain so that the council evaluate the Chase Buchanan application properly and keep the designation for retail use.</p>

    <p>The Gas Man is certainly there now;  He appeared on Wednesday, dug a huge hole in the pavement opposite Oddbins and arbitrarily placed "Pavement Closed" signs (yet again - see <a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2006/11/letter_to_the_e.html">www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2006/11/letter_to_the_e.html</a>)</p>  <p>Well, we had to walk to school on Thursday morning, so,  I admit it was me - I held my arm out and strode to the middle of the road to block the traffic and allow the children to safely walk past.  I then moved the "Pavement Closed" signs aside further up so we could get by.  A fat gas man (with regulation builders bum showing) moved them back shortly after.  He should stop sitting around and do more exercise, ie get digging!!!!</p>  <p>By Thursday evening though they had done the right thing, and erected some pedestrian barriers around their hole, with traffic lights to delay the cars.</p>  <p>Wow what a big gas pipe!  It <strong>always</strong> smells of gas around there, perhaps they will fix it properly this time!</p>  <p>Ed</p>
