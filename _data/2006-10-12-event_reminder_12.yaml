    <p>Hallo - I live in Australia - I was born in Sydney Road!  My Mother often took me to Moor Mead in my pram and then later we used the play ground there for many years and have walked over the railway bridge so many times.... I hope you all had a good day on Saturday and that the Daffodils all come up next Spring.  It is great to see that the area has never been built on and has remained like it was 70 years ago!! Best wishes.  &#39;Tricia Hammond</p>
