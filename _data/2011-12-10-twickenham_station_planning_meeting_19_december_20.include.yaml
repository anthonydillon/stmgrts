    <p>The Council officers recommend this tower block plan despite it exceeding the Council&#39;s planning guidelines restricting height and have disgracefully ignored the huge amount of local resident opposition....over 4000 signed petitions, plus nearly 900 on line and 800 signed letters of objection. Limited and distorted support for the developers Solum plan is based on a new Station and NOT the total development! RFU&#39;s cynical and self centered backing is myopically based on a 5 week World Cup in 2015, with no regard to the ghastly legacy that residents will have to live with afterwards for many decades. We all want a new station but a sensible low rise development which Twickenham can be proud of for the next 50-100 years. Join a public protest outside York House on December 19 at 6.30pm to voice your objections!</p>

    <p>When viewing the application there are now so many objections and superseded documents it&#39;s now quite hard to be sure one is looking at exactly the right document!  Would be nice if the planning website could help with sorting/filtering. Have objected on terms of height, character, light, parking provision and school places provision.</p>

    <p>All done and dusted after a mere 4 hours: Twickerati  writes: &#39;Solum Regeneration&#39;s plans for Twickenham station were approved by Richmond Council&#39;s Planning Committee last night. At a long and sometimes stormy meeting at York House the cases for and against were presented.</p>  <p>Despite the ruling Tory Council having recently adopted an SPD planning framework for the area which wanted a maximum of five stories at the station, the Committee decided to vote through the plans anyway. So that shiny new SPD is clearly a complete waste of time . . &#39;</p>  <p><a href="http://twickerati.wordpress.com/2011/12/20/twickenham-station-plans-approved/comment-page-1/#comment-1064">twickerati.wordpress.com/2011/12/20/twickenham-station-plans-approved/comment-page-1/#comment-1064</a></p>
