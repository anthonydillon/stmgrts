    <p>If you want to dispel that story about Fanny Adams, here&#39;s a song I often sing:</p>  <p>Sweet Fanny Adams, Young and gay<br /> On the old apple tree in the orchard<br /> She carved her name one day<br /> Then a woodpecker came in September<br /> And the woodpecker would peck away<br /> So now all you can see on the old apple tree<br /> Is sweet F A</p>

    <p>Is that really a photograph of Fanny Adams?  I don&#39;t think so, hardly anyone had their photographs taken in those days.  The quality of the picture looks a bit too good for 1867 too</p>  <p>~ Absolute sympathy for the murdered child, though.</p>

    <p>Fanny Adamms was my great great aunt, I have tried to find a picture of her but have never found one, I don&#39;t know if this is genuine or not but it would be nice if it is, but how can we be sure.  June Allart.</p>

    <p>Sadly it is not a photograph of Fanny Adams. Lynn Morton is correct, the photograph post-dates Fanny&#39;s death and was most likely taken around 1900.</p>  <p>Also,George Adams had five children there are no photographs of them other than the one of Lizzie along with her friend Minnie standing beside Fanny&#39;s gravestone.</p>  <p>Furthermore at the time of Fanny&#39;s death photography was new and very expensive. Most poor families (George was a bricklayer and Harriet took in washing)would not have been able to afford it. Those that could, would only have one photograph of the whole family.</p>  <p>Finally take a look at the dress of the little girl. For the period it puts her in the middle class not working class.</p>  <p>Sad to say, there is no photograph of Fanny Adams only a post mortem sketch made by a police artist.</p>

    <p>The Flood Meadows and Tanhouse Lane are on the way to the local shops from our house. The hop gardens are now houses except near the River Wey (a stream safe for all dogs in the Flood Meadows) where there are play fields. The walk under the trees by the River Wey in the Meadows is wonderful as the old watercress beds are still there. It&#39;s currently the time of year of the murder and on our walk tonight it&#39;s hard to imagine something so brutal happening somewhere so utterly tranquil. Chris C, Alton, Hants</p>
