    <p>Yes, the planning system worked. The many objections from various organisations and individuals persuaded the planning committee to<br /> refuse planning permission despite the recommendation by planning officers for consent.<br /> Exellent representations from representatives of<br /> NSMRA (North St Margarets Residents Association)<br /> and SMERA (St Margarets Estate Residents Association) to the planning committee and consequent appeal had the result we all hoped for.</p>
