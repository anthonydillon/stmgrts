    <p>This wine bar is a great idea and fits the ethos of St Margarets.  To all the small-minded opposers - do you want to attract a Boots to compete with Superdrug?  Or maybe a Sainbury&#39;s to compete with Tesco?  Why not just invite any high street shop with the criterium that it must be part of a national chain?</p>  <p>A wine bar sounds perfect for St. M.  People can walk to it and enjoy it along with the other restaurants in the village without having to go to Richmond or further.  I wholeheartedly support Parvinu.</p>

    <p>Well, I think that know I know a bit more about it that it will be a positive edition to St.Margarets. If you dont like it you dont have to use it. If it does cause the terrible problems you think it is going to cause then complain. Give them a chance first. Think of the people that will enjoy it.<br /> And before you slam me down remember... the law is on your side if it causes the alcohol related issues as listed on this site. You can close it down within 24 hours. Until then stop the &#39;what if&#39; panic.</p>

    <p>Sorry I&#39;m so small minded, but I&#39;m not sure how much more I&#39;ve learn&#39;t than I knew before.  Too big, too near, too wrong for St Margarets</p>

    <p>I&#39;ve kept out of this so far but now I just have to comment.</p>  <p>It is ridiculous to say that if we don&#39;t like it we don&#39;t have to use it. The proposed bar is metres from my children&#39;s bedroom. They will not feel any positive benefit from this for many years to come but will unfortuately suffer from all the negative aspects that a large bar will bring.</p>  <p>My main concern is that my children should be able to sleep at night. I do not think this is small minded.</p>

    <p>The argument that other uses may be even more disruptive seems superficially attractive, but perhaps if Tesco or Superdrug used the storage area they would not have to deliver so often or put those ugly cages outside the shop.</p>  <p>The responses suggest that a smaller wine bar may be welcome elsewhere. Which other premises did Grapespot consider, if any?</p>

    <p>Please do not open a Wine Bar here.  I am unable to go out in my car at night as it is, without having to park miles away when I come home as every inch of parking space (including cars parked very dangerously on corners) is used.</p>

    <p>The interview states that they "plan...to close their doors by midnight".  In my house, we go to bed at 10.30 most nights as we have busy jobs,  we need to sleep and get up around 6 am.  This statement just worries me even more and what will happen if (and I&#39;m sure when) they apply for a licence extension.  If you live nearby - as we do - disturbance in the area is already too much and will become far worse with the proposed wine bar.  This and the traffic disruption is just not acceptable.</p>

    <p>First off great site - love the community dialogue. I think the St Mags pub has been a great asset to St Mags - and I can only think that this will be of a similar, if not better, addition. Gets my vote.</p>

    <p>This is not a cosy little wine bar hidden under our friendly local greengrocers.  It&#39;s a large establishment serving drinks and offering food</p>

    <p>I appreciate the concerns, but a quality wine bar targeting the older crowd would be a nice addition. I don&#39;t think a "vertical drinking" establishment would work there anyway with the attractions of Richmond and Twickenham nearby, so they will have to focus on the mature crowd.  I know we oldies can get as out of order as the rest of them, but I&#39;m a wine fan and I like the idea.  I think noise levels need to be monitored given the proximity to residents but  overall worth a go.</p>

    <p>I welcome the opportunity to experience a new &#39;upmarket&#39; venue which to walk to and meet friends locally.  Things in St Margarets have to change from time to time and I have no reason to believe that this enterprise will do anything but enhance our village.  I think we need to start looking at positives rather than negatives.....it could be fun!</p>

    <p>I went to Parvinu for the first time the other day and have to say, what a fab place to meet friends for a catch up. The food was great and they have an excellent wine list!<br /> PS. No outlandish behaviour spotted at all!!! Drats!</p>
