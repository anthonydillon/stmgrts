    <p>Hi,</p>  <p>Here is a comment from one of the AHM members based in another area in Barnes Green.  AHM received a number of comments in the article in November-08, but have not been able to contact each of you without an email address.  Feel free to contact AHM.</p>  <p>I am part of the Barnes Group - We meet at The OSO on Barnes Green on Saturday mornings 10 AM and basically have a ball for an hour. The time is over before you know it and you have exercised, had a laugh( we do a lot of that)and chatted ( we do even more of that!)and made new friends. AND IT IS FREE!!!<br /> What are you waiting for!</p>  <p>sheena at 23 January 2009 8:23 PM</p>
