    <p>and the sign on the lamppost says there&#39;s a planning application in for various demolitions and additions to ancillary buildings.</p>  <p>Can a repaint back to a normal colour be too much to hope for?</p>

    <p>The planning application shows a 150 seat restaurant, including conversion of the former hall and half the garden to dining areas. Good luck to them! No mention of colour...</p>

    <p>The Marble Hill is now being run by a pub management company, until its new owner, thought to be Sainsburys, decide what to do with it. It is open normal hours and they will start doing food again next week.</p>

    <p>The &#39;East Twickenham News&#39; (a Council initiative) reports:</p>  <p>&#39;The Marble Hill rises again! . . there are covenants on the freehold that mean it has to remain a pub  . . So Sainsbury&#39;s immediately sold it on to the new landlord, Roger, who is busy making some changes. Right now, it&#39;s open 7 days a week from noon to 11 pm. They are offering food . . [it will] focus on craft beers .  .  [he] wants to change the name of the pub. He doesn&#39;t much like the Marble Hill, or even the Rising Sun. He&#39;s thinking of The Birch - a good solid name, referencing the wood that will fire the pizza oven . .  &#39;<br /> <a href="http://easttwickenham.org/news/marble-hill-pub-under-new-owne/">easttwickenham.org/news/marble-hill-pub-under-new-owne</a></p>
