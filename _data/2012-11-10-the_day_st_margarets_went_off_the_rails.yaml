    <p>Martin,</p>  <p>This is an interesting piece. It was impressive that the station was operating within a few hours of the crash.</p>  <p>Regarding Solum&#39;s planned Twickenham station train crash - have you read the TAP (Twickenham Advisory Panel) report?</p>  <p>Do you think it is acceptable that Solum and the Council failed to consider alternative options for this landmark redevelopment.</p>  <p>Solum and the Council claim to have consulted, but both ignored the TAP report because they didn&#39;t like its recommendations. This is especially disturbing as Lord True set up TAP to represent Twickenham residents.</p>  <p>What thousands of Twickenham residents want a is a station that is fit for purpose for the next 50 years. Solum are more interested in short term residential led profit. The two positions are incompatible. NR need to reconsider their approach to the station redevelopment.</p>
