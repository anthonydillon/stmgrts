    <p>whilst orders on a sailing ship of leeward or windward have some meaning when the ship is &#39;beating&#39; ie making it&#39;s way across or toward the direction of the wind ( with sails set one side or other) when &#39;running&#39; away fom the wind (at least when on &#39;a dead run&#39; with the wind coming directly from behind the ship) they are meaningless, so they are not the universal orders, rather &#39;port the helm&#39; &amp; &#39;starboard&#39; meaning in &#39;land language&#39; &#39;left&#39; &amp; &#39;right&#39; might be used</p>
