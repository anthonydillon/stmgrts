    <p>Many thanks for this extra information. Why, when there is a loading bay before the bridge, just thirty metres away where lorries can pull in from the carriageway, do the council feel that is is important to accommodate Tesco in the way that they have at this point. At 7am on Thursday morning I saw one Tesco lorry in the loading bay and another was parked on the very narrow pavement opposite (not in front of) Oddbins.</p>  <p>And, the decision to put double yellow lines round the corner of Broadway Avenue, with the loss of at least one, probaly two parking bays is deplorable.</p>  <p>All is being done, it seems, to accommodate Tesco&#39;s existing distribution system and not to force them to adapt to situations. The only way now to prevent this change is for councillors to call in the decision, now.</p>

    <p>I fully agree with Trevors comments, who at the council made this decision and on what grounds? Our council has bent over backwards to help Tesco and has ignored the people of St.Margarets.<br /> Trevor comments about how to prevent the changes taking place by calling in the decision - how do you do this Trevor?</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, after posting this notice I was told that the date for our councillors to try to call this decision in for review has passed. I can only suggest anyone who wants to see the decision reversed write to councillor Mark Kreling. His email address is  <a href="mailto:cllr.mkreling@richmond.gov.uk">cllr.mkreling@richmond.gov.uk</a>, with copies to Cllrs dporter, ahambidge and slamb.</p>

    <p>Re. the comments from Andrew Darvill, specifically: <i>"In essence Tesco&#39;s reiterated their desire to work in a cooperative manner making deliveries at during reasonable hours and where loading/unloading is difficult to try and ensure there is only vehicle at a time visiting a store."</i></p>  <p>I walk past Tesco every day on my way to work and see plenty of deliveries outside the permitted delivery times. There are also numerous occasions when more than one vehicle is delivering. I can&#39;t see how this can be termed co-operative - it&#39;s blatantly ignoring the rules.</p>  <p>We now have Superdrug making HGV deliveries as well, which I suspect increased the pressure on the council to increase the size of the bay. I wonder, though, if there&#39;s any plan in place between Tesco and Superdrug to alternate their deliveries?</p>

    <p>Have you tried writing up a petition and getting all residents of ST Margarets to sign it?</p>

    <p>I agree with you Xandria. I also think we should organise a demonstration outside Tescos.<br /> BEN KHOSA</p>

    <p>Why cannot Tescos be persuaded to use smaller lorries for their local high street outlets instead of these inappropriate  articulated monsters. Mind you if we shopped elsewhere ie support our smaller local shops then Tesco would not have to replace their stock quite so often.</p>

    <p>Be very careful. According to the above article you can use the loading bay to park for one hour on a Saturday after 4pm.  I have recently been hit with a penalty charge (&pound;50 payment within 14 days, after that &pound;100).  I was waiting in my car (not parked, just waiting) whilst my friend jumped out to use the cashpoint.  We were there no longer than 2 minutes.  This happened on a Saturday afternoon at 4.02pm.  The number given to pay the notice is an automated service, only giving me the option to pay, not to dispute the charge.  I will be taking it further.  There are cameras there and they have photographic evidence.  This is sickening. Soon you won&#39;t be able to breath without paying a penalty.</p>
