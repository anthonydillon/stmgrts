    <p>The so called levelling of the perfectly flat enough Moormead Park is a disgrace, if there is anyone in St Margarets who a Thinks Moormead needed it and b believes that now is the time to spend &pound;60k on it I would love to meet them. At a time when the pavillion is a disgrace how can this be the priority. I have spoken to parent governors and teachers from St Stephens who all deny asking for this. Local democracy in Richmond is non existant.What next brighter white lines for the A316, less steep pavements,or possibly much needed pigeon shelters. Your report is also misleading, it is over one half of the main area on the North side of the park. The amount ploughed up is far greater than originally agreed and it is denying people access to the park at the busiest time of use for three months.</p>

    <p>Robin,</p>  <p>I think you are mistaken on a few things.</p>  <ol> <li>The cost for the grading was &pound;20k, funded by lottery money on St Stephens&#39; request and can only be used for this -- it is not fungible.</li> <li>The &pound;60k is for a new playground.  The merits of and direction this money is spent is worth debating.</li> <li>I think this might be the best few months to do this work, better than hurting the St Margarets Fair or people using it in the summer months.</li> <li>The lawn near the Crane was truly in awful shape with many holes and full of weeds.</li> </ol>  <p>I do agree the park&#39;s condition is pretty poor. The Council should:</p>  <ol> <li>Fix up the clubhouse</li> <li>Repair the tennis nets and clean the courts</li> <li>Fix the asphalt pavements everywhere</li> <li>Fine dog walkers who do not pick up their dog&#39;s crap</li> <li>Better light the path from Cole Park Road to Moormead Road.</li> </ol>  <p>Peter</p>

    <p>It is nice to see that the park gets some attention!</p>  <p>There is much that needs to be improved since it is in a poor shape. I hope they will build a running track as well.</p>  <p>Dirk</p>

    <p>We play cricket on Moormead. We have suffered our fair share of injuries caused by the uneven surface. Several years ago we invested &pound;5000 to flatten the playing area. It helped but not much. Why? Well, I am told Moormead used to be used as some sort of refuse dump. Therefore, the surface constantly sinks etc. I have a nasty suspicion that the &pound;20,000 spent will really be a waste of money when in a few years time it all starts to sink again. Well done to the school for getting the grant but you have to say that &pound;20,000 does seem a rip off.</p>  <p>Alistair Wright Crossbats Cricket Club</p>

    <p>Peter&#39;s comments about what needs doing to the Park are absolutely right,and of course it is great that people care about local facilities. But to say that this is &pound;20k (if that is the figure and how do you know ?) well spent is ridiculous. I have yet to meet anyone who admits that they asked for this. Do you know anyone ?</p>  <p>We should not have had the cheek to accept the &pound;20k if this is the case, it is a waste of money that could have been better spent elsewhere.</p>  <p>A few potholes, some weeds, it is a park you know not a bowling green, for a variety of uses not all of which need completely level ground-  and the pitches were perfectly playable as witnessed by the hundreds of people using the pitches each week without injury.</p>  <p>The work therefore should not have happened at any time. The greatest threat to sportspeople using the park is the irregularity of the grass being cut.</p>  <p>The improvements you suggest could actually be tackled in the main by a volunteer group with Council backing. If people are interested in improving the park let&#39;s see if one springs up.There was supposed to be an action group committee meeting that has not materialised.</p>

    <p>After attending the last public meeting on November 8<sup>th</sup>, it was clear that proper consultation had not occurred and that although a residents&#39; survey was carried out, this was after the &pound;60,000 budget for playground improvement and &pound;20,000 grant for levelling had been allocated. Priority improvements identified at that meeting were: better lighting, pavilion and toilet refurbishment, playground improvement, cricket pitch stop nets, new benches, bins etc and overall improve the maintenance and security of the site. It was also agreed that a Friends Group would be formed and a meeting is set for Thursday March 9<sup>th</sup>, 7 30 pm at Winchester Hall to do this. As a Cole Park Road resident, member of the local Liberal Democrats comments team and Moormead user it is good to see that a proper consultation process will now take place to manage future development of Moormead and coordinate any necessary fundraising for this very valuable local resource that we all clearly feel passionate about.</p>  <p>Geoff Acton</p>
