    <p>Note that the plans leaked to and published by Twickerati are NOT the plans now favoured by the Council, which come from N Foster &amp; co. and remain Top Secret.</p>  <p>The site is in Riverside ward; contact details for all three councillors are at: <a href="http://www.richmond.gov.uk/home/council/councillors/who_are_my_councillors.htm">www.richmond.gov.uk/home/council/councillors/who_are_my_councillors.htm</a> They are all Conservatives so their natural instinct will be to support Lord True, who has just led them to victory in last month&#39;s election.</p>  <p>Where is Scott Naylor when we need him?</p>  <p>The borough&#39;s planning policies would squash this development if it was a private initiative but we can expect the planners to find reasons enough to disregard them for this &#39;exceptional&#39; scheme.</p>  <p>You need to follow the example of the Footbridge campaign: get a Facebook page; get the national press interested, send a piece to Private Eye&#39;s Rotten Borough column, organise a demo.</p>

    <p>Today&#39;s RTT Online has: &#39;A right royal argey-bargey (p 1 lead story); and two letters: Digging up area for Gloriana (p 25) and No mention of riverside plans can be found anywhere from Mr Bigley (p 26)</p>  <p><a href="http://edition.pagesuite-professional.co.uk/launch.aspx?pbid=c7955673-549d-44a9-9a9c-a642bedeaef8">edition.pagesuite-professional.co.uk/launch.aspx?pbid=c7955673-549d-44a9-9a9c-a642bedeaef8</a></p>

    <p>I like the idea. It seems appropriate given the cultural and creative history of Twickenham. Let us be positive about this. If there are to be any working groups let them be to ensure that this proposal brings advantages to Twickemham.</p>

    <p>Why build this "dry dock" at significant expense when a perfectly good facility already exists in the borough which could be improved and made suitable for a modest investment.  It&#39;s called Thames Young Mariners.</p>  <p>Christopher Squire: Scott Naylor is also opposing this, search <a href="https://twitter.com/TwickRegenrate" title="twitter for @TwickRegenrate">@TwickRegenrate</a> on twitter.</p>

    <p>I think it&#39;s a great idea, it will bring people from all over to enjoy our park and area, it&#39;s not just for resident, I like the bit written by the protesters "The London borough of Richmond upon Thames is secretly planning to destroy a tranquil riverside park".</p>  <p>Tranquil!!  it might be at 08:00hrs on a week day, but visit at weekends and the playground is full of screaming and screeching children, barking and yapping dogs, hardly Tranquil.</p>  <p>I can&#39;t seen to find anything about destroying ancient trees and the children&#39;s playground, or is it a case of put it anywhere, but not in my backyard.</p>  <p>I hope it all goes ahead asap</p>
