    <p>I have real concerns regarding the handing over of yet more power to the planning department and particularly to officers operating in our ward.  Judging by the experience of myself, neighbours, local architects, colleagues et al, we are ruled by the most obstructive and unpleasant planning department.  This proposal will mean that the people who like to say no will be able to do so with impunity once enshrined in the local plan.  Given the huge cost of moving to accommodate a growing family, the ability to extend provides a vital means of increasing space for those working to normal budgets.  This proposal will apply draconian and disproportionate constraints to what is fundamentally a pleasant area but by no means one which requires this level of "protection".</p>
