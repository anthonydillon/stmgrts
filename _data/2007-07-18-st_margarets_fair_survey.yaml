    <p>I was pleased to see the good turnout this year. I enjoyed the fair and thought it went very well. The events football, dog show and displays went down well. There was a good mixture of charity and private stalls.<br /> I have taken a charity stall in the past and feel it is important to keep the charges to locals supporting charities at a low enough level to encourage participation. It is the local volunteers who give the event character.</p>  <p>Thanks for all your efforts and good work.</p>  <p>regards<br /> John</p>
