    <p>It will be lovely to have this space back for dog walkers and local people to enjoy now the ponies have been moved to a more suitable location for them. A key to success will be stopping the &#39;anti-social behaviour&#39; that goes on down the adjacent lane and makes it less safe than it should be down there.</p>
