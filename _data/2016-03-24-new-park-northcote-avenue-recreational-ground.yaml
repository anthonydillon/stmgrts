    <p>It will be lovely to have this space back for dog walkers and local people to enjoy now the ponies have been moved to a more suitable location for them. A key to success will be stopping the &#39;anti-social behaviour&#39; that goes on down the adjacent lane and makes it less safe than it should be down there.</p>

    <p>Two months after the report of this consultation was written, I have recently been sent a copy.</p>  <p>I note that:</p>  <ol> <li>The consultation, completed in February, got 36 replies from 600 mailings, a 6% reply rate.</li> <li>Nearly half of the few respondents appear never to have used the open space.</li> <li>Over two thirds made no comment when asked whether the plan would achieve its aims.</li> </ol>  <p>Though the report appears to be detailed, I discovered today that further responses, including my own, were not included, despite assurances that they would be, because they were not submitted on the online form.</p>  <p>This all looks a bit worrying for local democracy, doesn&#39;t it? There is a real danger we will be led by well meaning enthusiasts into something which just simply will not work for the people most affected.</p>  <p>We are amongst Richmond residents closest to the open space, and have a lot of experience of its use - and abuse - over the years. There can be noone keener than us to find a solution which benefits local people at a manageable and sensible cost to the public purse. However, we do not feel that what has thus far been proposed is realistic, and cannot see how it will achieve its stated aims (for example, "to increase security and reduce anti social behaviour" and "to encourage wildlife to flourish"). As long term residents we are very concerned in particular about the proposal to move the fence towards the river, on a bank already eroding thanks to the neglect of Hounslow Council over several years, as well as the idea of viewing points for dog walkers at the back of our house.</p>  <p>If you are interested or concerned in what is being proposed, please find time to come to the public meeting at 7:30pm on 19th May at All Souls&#39; church, Northcote Road.</p>

    <p>Does anyone know how far towards St Margarets roundabout this "nature reserve" is meant to extend to?</p>
