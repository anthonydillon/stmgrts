    <p>Funny they claim to have no money - are these the same Councillers that were claiming in their election propaganda that the Conservatives had hoarded 52m-odd of taxpayers money, which they would return to residents forthwith?</p>  <p>I struggle to comprehend why people voted the Lib-Dems back in.  They are turning out to be as arrogant and low-calibre as during their previous term.  Look at Wandsworth - Conservative council for years, council tax approximately a third of ours, band-for-band.  Fact.</p>
