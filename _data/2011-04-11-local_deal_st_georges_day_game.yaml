    <p>Sounds like Wasps are getting desperate to me. They should be - Harlequins&#39; big game had a majority of tickets at &pound;10 or &pound;5 for under 21s.</p>  <p>Why would Twickenham residents - who are most likely going to be Quins supporters - want to pay &pound;25 or &pound;45 to see Wasps play when they could pay less than that to go to The Stoop and see Quins?</p>
