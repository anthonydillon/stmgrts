    <p>Wandsworth has, in many roads, a 10.30 to 11.30 parking ban except for residents. It works very well.</p>

    <p>Parking: As a resident of Orchard Road we too have noticed a vast increase in commuter parking (even on double red lines). To add insult, some non residents park their vehicles whilst away on their holidays!</p>

    <p>It occurs to me that if we have to have CPZs in any form, a one hour restriction would deter the communters but not inconvenience residents who may have to accomodate deliveries, workmen and personal visitors. Perhaps this is harder to enforce but the mere fact that a restriction is in place should serve as some deterrent.</p>
