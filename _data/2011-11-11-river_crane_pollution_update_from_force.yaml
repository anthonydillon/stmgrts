    <p>Very pleased to read this. It&#39;s still a terrible thing to happen but reassuring to hear about all the plans. Let&#39;s hope they get seen through.</p>  <p>No more moaning about it always raining now...</p>

    <p>Briefing Update from the Environment Agency</p>  <p>Current remediation of the River Crane<br /> On 17 February 2012 the Environment Agency, Thames Water Utilities Limited (Thames Water) and<br /> Total Waste Management Solutions Ltd (TWMS) jointly inspected the River Crane. Together we identified<br /> four locations along the river and adjacent areas where materials from the pollution incident needed to be removed.</p>  <ul> <li>Crane Park Island Nature Reserve above Shot Tower;</li> <li>the A30 road bridge near Eastern Perimeter Road;</li> <li>the footbridge where the river passes behind Cranford Infant School;</li> <li>the A4 road bridge near the White Hart pub.</li> </ul>  <p>Given the time which had elapsed since the initial sewage pollution incident, we instructed Thames Water to undertake the required remediation works. Over the past month, Thames Water and TWMS have<br /> collected, removed and disposed of the upper layers of sewage contaminated silt and sediment. The<br /> contaminated materials were secured and removed to Mogden Sewage Treatment Works by tanker.<br /> Our officers, along with employees from Thames Water, inspected the areas that had been remediated<br /> on 13 April 2012. We are waiting for the results of samples taken by Thames Water to confirm if the<br /> remediation works have been satisfactory.</p>  <p>Future restoration of the River Crane<br /> We will continue to assess the long term impact of the pollution incident on the ecology of the river<br /> throughout the summer and autumn. When we have completed our assessment we will make proposals<br /> for fish restocking and habitat restoration in conjunction with the other members of The Crane Valley Partnership.</p>  <p>We want to ensure the River Crane is restored, as far as possible, to the condition it was in before the<br /> incident, and that polluters are held accountable where an offence has been committed. We cannot<br /> comment on the proposed value of any river restoration fund at this time. Although we are interested to know the basis of the figures proposed we have had no involvement in any discussions about the fund.</p>  <p>Any restoration fund must be aimed at rectifying the evidence based impacts caused by a pollution<br /> incident on the river and its adjacent areas and not just a means of self imposed sanction.</p>  <p>What happens next?<br /> We are continuing with our criminal investigation. People affected by the incident are being contacted for further details and invited to provide a witness statement. If you have any information about this pollution incident or wish to give a statement, please contact us on 03708 506 506 and ask for Richard Cattan or Andy Grant.</p>
