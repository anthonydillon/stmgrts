    <p>&#39;A meeting of the Special Environment and Sustainability Overview &amp; Scrutiny Committee has been arranged for the 17 July 2008 to discuss the call-in for the St Margarets CPZ. It will be held at 7:30 pm in the Salon, York House.&#39;</p>

    <p>I am surprised at the lack of comments the CPZ- call in by the two councillors has generated.</p>  <p>At the risk of showing my ignorance I am pleased with the call in for the reason a) that St Peters Road was excluded from stage 2 despite an resounding Yes vote at stage 1. b) that at the 6 month review all residents of the original consultation be included as the effect of the new/ extended CPZ would be known by that time.</p>  <p>Both reasons, a) and b), cited by cllr Head and cllr Hodkins may of course be different to my interpretation of the wording.</p>

    <p>Although there may be good reason to canvass some roads, such as Orchard Road, north of the A316 after six months I can not agree with Gerhard that the whole area needs to be reconsulted. Do we really have to canvass Northcote Road again, for example.</p>  <p>St Peter&#39;s Road is a special case, where the reasons for its inclusion or exclusion are very different from any of the other roads in the area.</p>  <p>I think the reason that the call-in has attracted little comment is that it is interference from councillors without detailed knowledge of the area who have attached themselves to one of the two points of view whilst our own councillors have sensibly left it up to the views of people living in each street - as has been the model for CPZ inclusion or exclusion since they were started. This has to be the case, as the logical extension of the argument that the whole area should decide would be that roads would be pulled back out of existing CPZs. In the case of Broadway Avenue this would be against the wishes of 90% of its residents.</p>

    <p>Study of the agenda of a previous CPZ call-in suggests that the Overview &amp; Scrutiny Committee will be invited to either &#39;note&#39; Cllr Trigg&#39;s decision [i.e. to endorse it] or to refer it back to him for reconsideration, if they decide that it doesn&#39;t comply with the Council&#39;s CPZ policy.</p>  <p>I presume that Cllrs Head and Hodgins will be required to produce a more explicit account of just how &#39;the due processes and consultations were flawed&#39; before the meeting. If they don&#39;t,  I think we may infer that this call in has more to do with the bitter party battle on the Council than with the situation on the ground.</p>
