    <p>I am pleased to read that crossing times are to increase. When will this happen? At present, crossing the A316 is a potentially lethal activity, especially to those of us with only two legs. It&#39;s high time pedestrians were given more priority, frankly.</p>

    <p>The increased times are all part of an overall upgrade, which will include the ability to stop traffic on both sides of the A316 as outlined above.  I was told three months</p>

    <p>Nigel - I&#39;ve just left a message with St Stephen&#39;s school office asking if you could contact me as, through the North St Margarets Residents&#39; Association, we have arranged to meet with Peter Czachowski from TFL this Wednesday. Perhaps you could email me your mobile no, or get my home number from the school and we pool information.  It&#39;s taken us nearly 2 years of emailing to get this far so do want to make the most of it.  Hilary</p>

    <p>Hilary, Nigel - my observations that will no doubt<br /> coincide with yours to a degree.<br /> East bound traffic speed along the A316 toward the<br /> end of the green sequence is on average 35 mph, crossing the roundabout and many left turning vehicles enter St Margarets Road at speeds up to<br /> 30 mph.<br /> Typical stopping distance at 30 mph is 23 metres-<br /> 6 car lenght. (Highway Code)</p>  <p>Perhaps the pedestrian crossing should be located<br /> further south, away from the roundabout and without an island. (like the crossing near the<br /> Ailsa Tavern)</p>  <p>Extending the time for pedestrians to cross is contemplated; where will this time come from?<br /> Will it result in less frequent changes of sequences?<br /> At present impatient pedestrians cross when the<br /> lights are still red for them. A disturbing practice, particularly when parents/grandparents<br /> with children are waiting for the green light.<br /> It is difficult enough to teach children road dicipline if it is not practiced by what children see as grown ups.</p>

    <p>Hilary - I tried to call you on the number Ruth gave me.  You can e-mail me direct on nigelcannings <em>at</em> gmail.com</p>  <p>You met the same guy I did, so hopefully he said the same to you as to me.  It seems we need TfL and the Council to commit to moving the crossing somewhere safer</p>

    <p>Apologies - I met with Peter Czachowski of TFL on Wed 23rd Jan, along with Kate Holliday, Head of Governors at Orleans Infant School. Thought I&#39;d sent an update but have checked and I had forgotten. Productive meeting with action and ways forward.  Will send you short report for the website in a few mins.</p>
