    <p>Penelope as a member of the St Margarets Fair committee I do appreciate and respect your comment, but as it appears to be based upon the recipient&#39;s location (possibly due to it being part of their title) I should point out that some of the other recipient charities could also be &#39;not our area&#39;.  For example Crofters are based in Kew, and Richmond Welcare by Twickenham Green.  However all the recipients do all share a commonality - their services are available to, and used by residents of St Margarets.  Sorry we&#39;ve disappointed you but we spent a lot of time discussing the virtues (and vices) of each organisation both before and after they came to speak to us.  The fourteen committee members who reached their decision by a points voting system are a pretty mixed flavour of local residents especially in terms of age.  I&#39;m not suggesting that we got it right, but only that we did our best.</p>

    <p>A local charity that you might help this year is the Friends Of the River Crane Environment <a href="http://www.force.org.uk/">www.force.org.uk/</a>:</p>  <p>&#39;* To operate for the benefit of the public . . to protect and enhance the environment of the River Crane, the Duke of Northumberland&#39;s River, their corridors and surrounding open spaces within the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames and its environs, for the benefit of the ecosystem, residents and visitors.</p>  <ul> <li>To advance the education of the public in the ecology, conservation, protection and improvement of the environment of the River Crane . . &#39;</li> </ul>  <p>Mike Day writes: &#39;The next FORCE Volunteer Day takes place this coming Sunday (14th March) in Mereway Nature Park.  This is our annual child-friendly workday. Meet at the outdoor classroom in the middle of the Nature Park at 10.30 am or come along when you&#39;re free. Bring the whole family and invite your friends. People of all ages and abilities are welcome to join us on our volunteer days when we recommend that you wear tough outdoor clothes and footwear. We provide tools and gloves. If you can stay for the whole day, bring something to eat (we provide drinks) but we would be glad of your help for an hour or two. If you think that this kind of activity is not for you, come along anyway and see what&#39;s happening in some of your local open spaces.&#39;</p>  <p>Recommended to Barry Edwards and anyone else feeling liverish and out of sorts after a long and dreary winter!</p>

    <p>We as an organisation, Me too &amp; Co, established in 2006 have 50 local volunteers and are working for local families with children of additional needs are very happy to hear that the Friends of Crofters have received the main bulk of money.  Most of our families will benefit from this important service run by Social Services.  As a new charity themself it is very difficult to get additional funding because of their assosiation with Social Services, and yet, there is never enough funding availalbe to be creative for our children.</p>  <p>We are happy to get &pound;200 in order to buy sensory toys for the next generation of Crofters!</p>

    <p>I am more fascinated by the oh-so-precise amounts awarded! I&#39;m sure the Committee deliberated long and hard before deciding not to give each large beneficiary (say) &pound;2K each and the others (say) &pound;250 each. No doubt there were weighty matters at stake.</p>

    <p>No weighty matters David, just a simple points system - as used to divide the money up for the for the past four years. A single point was given a monetary value based on the total available. The committee individually allocated up to 5 points for each charity. The three charities that topped the points list therefore received what might seem to be &#39;odd&#39; amounts based on the points they got, and the remaining four charities received agreed amounts but based on the total number of points they had. Before we adopted a points system our discussions on what amounts to give to each school or charity could certainly be considered weighty.</p>
