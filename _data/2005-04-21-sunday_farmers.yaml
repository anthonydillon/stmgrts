    <p>Please note that some of the profits from market pitch rental will help to fund the St. Margaret&#39;s hanging baskets.</p>

    <p>I think a local farmers market will be great. I would like it to include a fresh bread and cakes stall.</p>

    <p>The market is in its consultation stage, there has been an objection from a local resident and we discussing the issues raised with the council. Hope to have more news soon.</p>

    <p>I would love to have a Farmers Market in St. Margarets.  I like the market atmosphere and the produce that can be purchased.  What I would like to see is a BAKERY store!! since there isn&#39;t an Bakery in St.Margarets any more.</p>
