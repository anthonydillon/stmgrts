    <p>It&#39;s not the prettiest piece of park equipment but in less than a week it seems to have made an impact.</p>  <p>Current position should be reviewed. As a resident overlooking the park, people seem to find it very offputting to be observed while exercising.</p>  <p>I think it could be a great addition to Moormead. Adults and children find it intriguing.</p>  <p>Perhaps it could be included in the fenced-off play area? Or positioned where people feel less exposed to scrutiny?</p>  <p>Maybe it would be worth doing a more formal survey, say on Saturday and/or Sunday mornings when the park is buzzing with families enjoying community football.</p>

    <p>Great idea...is big in europe and similar in the states, and can only be a good thing.</p>

    <p>It&#39;s a great idea - I agree with the location comment - perhaps it would be better sited somewhere less prominent but well done to the council for thinking of it.</p>

    <p>I noticed last Saturday, it had been graffiti&#39;d almost immediately.</p>
