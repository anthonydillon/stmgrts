    <p>They <em>should</em> put an ice rink there... that would be great for the community... but sad to see the studio go.</p>  <p>Also, more flats would put too much pressure on parking and schools, let&#39;s hope the Council uses the opportunity wisely -- for once.</p>

    <p>But they aren&#39;t going to be wise. It will be flats.  :0(.</p>

    <p>I hope this closure doesn&#39;t have too great an impact on the vibrant cafes and shops in our community.</p>

    <p>This has been on the cards for a while.  It&#39;s been known to be for sale for at least 6 months.  I understand however that the council wants it to have a film use (as in the current use.)  It would also be good to bring some business into the area...  flats would not be the right option...</p>

    <p>If Mr. Spielberg is interested, perhaps we should get a petition going to encourage him. And what about George Lucas? And any other directors? Perhaps if this was brought to their attention they would buy it, and save our little piece of movie history that has brought so many famous movie stars to our area. With 99 years of movie-making behind it, it is so sad to let it go and be replaced by flats.</p>

    <p>What we don&#39;t want is more houses/flats in St Margarets, that just puts pressure on schools, parking, etc,  it would be nice to think that the money we were originaly given for the Richmond ice rink site is still available, if it&#39;s not, who has stolen it!!!</p>  <p>It would be great if the site could be turned back into an ice rink as the site previously was, but as usual what the council tax payers want has no bearing to how Richmond Council act as they seem hell bent on ignoring anything the tax payers suggest.</p>

    <p>It is so, so, sad to hear of the demise of Twickenham Film Studios.   I know of people who have worked there, and enjoyed doing so very much.</p>  <p>I dread to think how many House/flats are going to put in it&#39;s place.   I do not mean this comment to be rude in any way, but some times, one does think when an announcement like this  appears, there is the thought " how many flats or houses are they going to attempt to put in this place.   Pubs in Old isleworth, and elsewhere in the Borough have gone the same way - one in Old Isleworth has ended up the same way - the former Public House was closed down quite a while ago, and people wondered what was the land to be used for ?    And in the next breath, people said " how many flats and/or houses will be put on this piece of land ?.</p>  <p>Please do not think that I begrude for one second anyone having a decent roof over their head, but with an increased population over the last few years. how can it be that there has to be all this continuous building on land that is so precious, and which soon will be no longer available for houses or flats to be built.   And then where will we be ?.    We are an island, there is only so much that that can be done for people who would want to live in this part of Great Britain.</p>
