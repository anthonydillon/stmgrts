    <p>It is incorrect to say that the petition will trigger a &#39;full debate in Council&#39;; in fact there will only be a &#39;debate in full Council&#39;, i.e. a formal presentation of the petition followed by short speeches from its originator, the Conservative cabinet member for youth, the Lib Dem spokesperson (Cllr Ellen Day, Hampton North) and a reply from Lord True.</p>  <p>They will all pledge their support for Heatham House as it is now; there will be no opportunity to discuss the perfectly sensible option suggested by the Council&#39;s planning consultants: moving the youth activities into a modern flexible building (which might serve them much better than a listed Georgian mansion) and converting the house into a hotel which would be good for the town.</p>  <p>There has only been one such debate on a petition, I think: on April 5 Anthony Kennedy presented one asking for a Roman Catholic secondary school; see: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/3sgm7af">tinyurl.com/3sgm7af</a> . Cllr Geoffrey Samuel, perhaps suffering from a &#39;senior moment&#39; (he is 80), has since claimed that &#39;the Council voted unanimously in favour&#39; of a Catholic school: there was no vote and he has been asked to withdraw his comment.</p>  <p>The Richmond Inclusive Schools Campaign are planning a petition asking the Council to use the the Clifden road site which it is now buying for a community secondary school instead of a Roman Catholic one as they propose; see: <a href="http://www.richmondinclusiveschools.org.uk/">www.richmondinclusiveschools.org.uk</a></p>

    <p>Christopher, just to clarify our intentions regarding Heatham House.</p>  <p>Friends of Heatham House most definately do not wish to keep Heatham House in the state it currently is, it has become seemingly deliberately run down, underpromted and underfunded. Funds the centre raised through its&#39; own program diverted into central accounts, it&#39;s fund raising capabilities reduced due to centralised control with resulting problems preventing several lines of regular income, then there&#39;s the large sum of money being "held" until a decision is made.</p>  <p>Heatham House should currently have in excess of &pound;350,000 in funds, these could cover the cost of DDA Access, enhancements to the facilities and improvements in provision for young people.</p>  <p>We #FoHH# would like to see Heatham House retained, properly managed and run #either by LBRUT or Social Enterprise# and expanded to not only improve and expand facilities for the young, but to increase what it can offer the whole local community by way of daytime use and access to facilities at times young people do not use them.</p>  <p>The "sensible option" you refer to is, on paper  a great idea. However, it is an unspecified facility with no known cost. Even with the Section 106 money #that should be available from the developer# to replace Heatham House with a capable facility would most likely cost significantly more and come from central funding. The section 106 money could be used in conjunction with the funds Heatham House should already have acess to, this would easily finance the enhancement of the current facility and would also mean a much lower public expenditure on retaining a valuable, high quality youth provision in Twickenham.</p>
