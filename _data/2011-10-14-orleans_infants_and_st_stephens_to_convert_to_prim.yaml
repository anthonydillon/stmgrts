    <p>This will replace the now effectively permanent but notionally temporary bulge class at OI with a permanent extra form of entry but will not be enough for any further rise in demand.</p>

    <p>I think this is good news that something is finally happening to alleviate the stress and uncertainty that has surrounded primary school places over the last couple of years.</p>  <p>By not building a sizeable new school but instead essentially filling the existing ones to bursting point isnt the ideal solution, but it is a definite step forward.</p>  <p>I hope that these proposals go through and that they are managed in a professional way such that the &#39;disruption&#39; years (2012-2015) when places like Orleans Infant and St Stephens primary are radically changing by expanding their age range are not too disruptive to the pupils and staff during this period.</p>  <p>A definite step forward though (assuming it all goes through of course).</p>  <p>Any one else care to comment?</p>

    <p>I agree, something had to be done, and this is a good start, BUT:</p>  <p>I am interested to see how the spaces for the new reception class at St Stephens are allocated. Presumably the catchment area for non-sibling for Orleans will be almost non-existent, ie most of the 60 places for Orleans reception will go to siblings. Given that the catchment area for St Stephens is totally different to the catchment area for Orleans, families that would have gotten into Orleans by the old system, might now not get into Orleans or St Stephens. What will happen to children who are not in catchment for either Orleans or St Stephens?</p>  <p>Any thoughts?</p>
