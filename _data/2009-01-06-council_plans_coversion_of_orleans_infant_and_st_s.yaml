    <p>Wasn&#39;t this same plan just looked at 2-3 years ago and deemed not feasible do to not enough space. Why is the council spending money on a study again? What has changed about the two premises?</p>

    <p>I imagine that what has changed is the forecast of demand: [i] from young families crowding into the area to get access to the already oversubscribed schools; and [ii] from the recession, which will sharply increase the percent of the age group requiring places because their parents can&#39;t afford to go private. Writing from memory, I think the take up is c. 95 percent in most boroughs but only 75 percent in Richmond upon Thames, suggesting that it may be lower still in St Mags/E Twickenham, now a relatively expensive area, so the potential for a sharp [&gt; 25 percent] increase in demand next autumn and in 2010 is there.</p>  <p>The proposed expansions may well be the &#39;least-worst&#39; option or even the only option open to the Council.</p>

    <p>&#39;c. 95 and  [&gt; 25 ] &#39; should be &#39; c. 95 percent and [&gt; 25 ]  percent] in the entry above. The &#39;%&#39; [percent] symbol is not displaying for reasons unknown.</p>

    <p>The percentage of children in St Margarets and North Twickenham, or Twickenham Riverside wards going to Richmond state primary schools has historically been between 50 and 60%, so it is easy to see demand increasing as a result of fewer children going to private education. I would suggest the feasibility study may have to look at ways of providing for nursery and reception classes for St Stephens off-site, but it is difficult to see where (the pavilion on Moormead?)</p>
