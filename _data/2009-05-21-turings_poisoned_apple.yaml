    <p>Thanks for this; the long and interesting entry in the Dictionary of National Biography includes this about the &#39;Turing Test&#39;: &#39; . . the most lucid and far-reaching expression of his philosophy [was] in the paper &#39;Computing machinery and intelligence&#39; (Mind, 59, 1950, 433-60). This, besides summarizing his view that the operation of the brain could be captured by a Turing machine and hence by a computer, also absorbed his first-hand experience with machinery. The wit and drama of the &#39;Turing test&#39; has proved a lasting stimulus to later thinkers, and a classic contribution to the philosophy and practice of artificial intelligence . . &#39;</p>  <p>Wikipedia adds: &#39;[It is] a proposal for a test of a machine&#39;s ability to demonstrate intelligence. It proceeds as follows: a human judge engages in a natural language conversation with one human and one machine, each of which tries to appear human. All participants are placed in isolated locations. If the judge cannot reliably tell the machine from the human, the machine is said to have passed the test. In order to test the machine&#39;s intelligence rather than its ability to render words into audio, the conversation is limited to a text-only channel such as a computer keyboard and screen . .</p>  <p>Turing predicted that machines would eventually be able to pass the test; in fact, he estimated that by the year 2000, machines with . . approximately 120 megabytes) of memory would be able to fool 30 % of human judges in a 5-minute test. He also predicted that people would then no longer consider the phrase "thinking machine" contradictory . . &#39; [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test]</p>

    <p>Wow, what an amazing story and so sad at how such an brilliant man was treated because of his sexuality,I didn&#39;t know much about the history of computing and found it very interesting and i will never look at the Apple sign in the same way again!</p>
