    <p>Subject: PRESS RELEASE: TfL Blasted for Stirring Trouble between St Margarets Pedestrians and Cyclists<br /> TfL Blasted for Stirring Trouble between St Margarets Pedestrians and Cyclists</p>  <p>Local Councillors and Richmond Cycling have discussed the Transport for London (TfL) consultation on the removal of the footbridge over the A316, coming to the conclusion that the proposal has little merit for cyclists and is cynical ploy by TfL to prompt division and discord, where the real rationale is cost reduction.</p>  <p>St Margarets and North Twickenham Councillor, Cllr Alexander Ehmann said:</p>  <p>"Not only are TfL proposing to dismantle bridges in St Margarets with no clear case, but they are also &#39;burning bridges&#39; between those that walk and those that cycle.  The truth is that St Margarets and North Twickenham&#39;s pedestrian and cycling communities are of one mind on this issue - the consultation is a disgrace and should be withdrawn "</p>  <p>Tim Lennon, Campaigns Coordinator at Richmond Cycling Campaign said:</p>  <p>"By trying to make the area in front of the school shared space, this design will be less usable for both walking and cycling. At peak times there will be severe conflict between walking and cycling across the whole junction, and to make things worse, nothing has been proposed to calm the traffic or more generally to make the crossing feel safe for the hundreds of families that would have to use it every day."</p>  <p>He added:</p>  <p>"Local people have made it very clear how they view the relative safety of a bridge versus a toucan crossing. Although a ground level crossing will improve cycling access to the area, the proposed design is nothing more than a feeble sticking plaster.  Cycling and walking provision on the A316 is mostly very poor, and nothing in this project will change that."</p>  <p>Notes to Editors:</p>  <p>Richmond Cycling is an organisation which strives for Richmond to be a cycle friendly borough. To achieve this, it works with the council to improve facilities for cyclists and seeks to raisie the profile of cycling in the borough through education and participation. Richmond Cycling want people to choose to cycle in the borough of Richmond and feel safe while doing so.</p>
