    <p>My husband and I are absolutely loving the sushi!  We&#39;ve enjoyed the fresh, melt in your mouth tuna and salmon but especially the sweet unagi! As transplants from California and Australia, we have to admit that this a treat!</p>  <p>If you have not tried, it&#39;s an absolute must!  Keep it comin&#39;!</p>
