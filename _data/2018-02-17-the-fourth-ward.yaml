    <p>As a newcomer (no prizes for remembering obscure 1960s soap), I rather like living in the "village" of St. Margarets.  It&#39;s part of the address - (road, village, town, county) - and I&#39;ve always placed it "between Twickenham &amp; Richmond", because that&#39;s where the station is.  Not sure when it became a "ward" which only seems to mean something to the council but anyway, it has the feel of a village and long may that continue.</p>

    <p>Before 2002 the four wards were West and South (as now), Central (comprising central and north Twickenham) and East, comprising St Margaret&#226;&#128;&#153;s and East Twickenham.</p>
