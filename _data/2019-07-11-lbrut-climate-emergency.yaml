    <p>DearCllr Neden-Watts, further to your speech on the Council&#39;s upcoming Climate Change Strategy. You talk of reducing emissions from transport by promoting sustainable transport, reducing car travel and traffic congestion. Then I am sure you have heard of the survey where the intention is, the closure of Burtons Road in Hampton hill, whereby all traffic will be diverted on to Park road from all the surrounding roads north of Burtons Road. Park road is the busiest road in the area and to redirect another 500 cars (councils survey) on to Park Road, well all I can is you say do the maths.</p>
