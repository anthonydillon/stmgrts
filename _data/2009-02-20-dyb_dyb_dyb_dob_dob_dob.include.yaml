    <p>Thanks Martyn for your review of the 1<sup>st</sup> St. Margarets cubs and scouts. I was further across Richmond with 6<sup>th</sup> Richmond cubs and scouts. The photos of the cub and scout uniforms, and those wide brimmed hats, a devil to keep on in windy weather! What I got from scouting is imeasureable in terms of experience and the preparation  for adulthood and becoming a decent citizen with values. It also certainly for me, helped when I went into the forces with National Service, the spirit of mucking in together and sometimes roughing it a bit at scout camps made a good start for going into the army ! All power to the scout movement for many many more years to come, and to the  dedicated leaders who give so much of their skills and time for scouting. What a great pity that all the youth of today do not have the experience of scouting in their lives, this country would be so much better for it.</p>
