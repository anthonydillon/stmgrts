    <p>I am very disappointed at the negative reponse from the council. Using the money from recycling our rubbish to pay for hanging baskets in our streets is such a great idea. Less landfill cleaner greener streets. Why does it have to be "a problem site" before the council are interesed? Why does it take from March to June to get a response? What are our councillors doing to support this initiative? Why is the answer always no!</p>

    <p>I would think the council would support a community that was looking for ways to improve itself. It sounds like allowing St. Margarets to adopt the site wouldn&#39;t have any cost/down side to the council.</p>

    <p>Just to clarify a few points, the traders association asked the council,in March, if in exchange for promotion of local recycling we could receive an income from the recycling site to spend on trees/plants in St.Margarets. This, we believe would give residents an incentive to recycle more - &#39;the more you recycle the greener your streets become&#39;. We were infrmed by councillor Hambidge (15 June) that the request was rejected because the site did not cause any problems and so adopting the site was unnecessary. I have today (28 June) had a discussion with Jo Surcouf from L.B.R.U.T. recycling office. Jo informed me that in this case the council could not justify funding for this project, Jo stressed that the council strongly supports recycling and is very willing to discuss any other ideas for promoting and improving recycling.</p>  <p>If you have any further suggestions please leave them here.</p>

    <p>Why are you looking for a new idea. This is a great idea, good for St.Margarets and for the council. More trees less red tape please.</p>

    <p>I do find it hard to understand why the local council are unwilling to support the community of St Margarets in allowing us to adopt the recycling site! Surely it shows that we really care about our village and the way it looks. Any additional money that could be raised to fund future floral displays would be fantastic and give St Margarets it own distinctive identity. It already is a vibrant place to live and work - but extra money for displays would really enhance the area so much more!</p>

    <p>The whole issue of recycling still needs to be addressed. Does anybody have any ideas what to do next?</p>
