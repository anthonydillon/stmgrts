    <p>At last the matter is resolved and my road will be having a CPZ. Residents of Kenley and Godstone, no point complaining now, you voted not to have the CPZ - all this rubbish about we cant afford it, you live in an affluent area, if you cant afford the permit sell up and move. Also, I often wonder how many people in this locality understand basic English. The questionnaire sent by the Council asked if others roads have a CPZ do you? and overwhelmingly you all voted NO - so again dont complain!! Lastly, has this Council got a bottomless pit of money to keep doing 6 monthly surveys on CPZs, no wonder Richmond Council Tax goes up and Ealing and Hounslow&#39;s doesnt. This must be raised in the meeting next week, no more money wasting CPZ surveys, its as bad as MPs expenses.</p>

    <p>Gosh, JY, I don&#39;t even drive but I have to confess I am shocked to see such a display of right wing intolerance in a forum like this.  You appear to be very happy with the CPZ outcome for your road... which makes it appear that your sole reason for writing in is to crow at those less fortunate than you, who did not get the CPZ they voted for.  (Furthermore, are you really advising those of a lower income bracket to move out of the area?)</p>

    <p>You are forgetting these roads voted NO to 2 separate questions asking them if they wanted a CPZ, and now because you and others dont like the outcome of a democratic process we keep on subjecting them to vote after vote, till we get the answer others want, sounds like you prefer the democracy of The Peoples Democratic Republic of North Korea.  The people who voted arent ignorant, they knew exactly what they were voting for esp on Q2 and the consequences of it, so lets not patronise them... and yes this is not a poverty stricken district that a cost of a parking permit will break the bank.  May be one less bottle of wine a week will pay for it</p>

    <p>Well said SF.</p>  <p>Actually some of the roads voted yes in the first vote - this round is actually the third vote we have now had. Yet this majority 67% initial vote in Kenley Road was ignored. Is that the democracy you crave JY?</p>
