    <p>Very interesting, and throws light on the background to the story we were told by the guide on a walk round Isleworth yesterday. We didn&#39;t know the same boys had been responsible for the Hounslow fire, or that they&#39;d started three others. They were lucky their names remained unknown - wouldn&#39;t happen nowadays!</p>
