    <p>I can recommend their fillet steak - delicious and not much more expensive than the bland stuff that the supermarket sells.</p>

    <p>We are really pleased the shop is now open.  The staff are friendly and helpful.  We can recommend their pies.  Agree with Hilary - the ham is delicious, chickens good and we will be trying the fillet steak soon!</p>

    <p>Its a lovely shop. The only thing is, I bought merguez sausages from them and they weren&#39;t at all spicey, not a single peppercorn. Very disappointing as I like to have my head blown off with merguez</p>
