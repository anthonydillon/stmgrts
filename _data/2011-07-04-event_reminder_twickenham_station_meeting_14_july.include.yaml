    <p>I cannot believe that anyone would think that Twickenham is an appropriate place for high rise buildings of any kind. It is bad enough that we have to put up with the appalling eyesore that is Regal House, which can even be seen from Richmond Park. If I could propose a plan for that area, it would be to demolish it and rebuild with a low rise development to include an appropriate amount of underground parking.</p>

    <p>While I have reservations about the design, and feel for the residents of Mary&#39;s Terrace and Cole Park Road, (a) the station is undeniably an inconveniently laid-out and sometimes dangerously overcrowded dump (b) station developments are very expensive and have to be externally financed these days and &#169; 5 stories is scarcely high-rise.</p>
