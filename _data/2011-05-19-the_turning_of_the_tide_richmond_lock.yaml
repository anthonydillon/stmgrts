    <p>Yup, many a grey Sunday afternoon with my Dad and siblings stickleback fishing in the Minnehaha in the seventies with the bamboo rod and net - had almost forgotten it&#226;&#128;&#153;s name! Trying to remember it brought me to this page.  Dad said it&#226;&#128;&#153;s name came from Hiawatha too.</p>

    <p>Can anyone tell me if they have heard that there are 2 trees(?) next to the minihaha between which the last dual in London was held...?  I have been told this tale, not sure if it is true.</p>
