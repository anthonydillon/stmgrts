    <p>Great background Martyn, as ever.</p>  <p>Just to bring things up to date: in the early 1990s, lock owner Port of London Authority (PLA) completed a &pound;4 million refurbishment prior to centenary celebrations in 1994, which were attended (appropriately) by Prince Andrew, Duke of York.</p>  <p>However, in 2004 the PLA - despite being a public trust committed to environmental best practice - decided to put an end to the public&#39;s 24 h free usage to the footbridge, despite residents&#39; protests, see <a href="http://www.richmondandtwickenhamtimes.co.uk/news/richmondnews/482977.Anger_as_bridge_closed_at_night/">www.richmondandtwickenhamtimes.co.uk/news/richmondnews/482977.Anger_as_bridge_closed_at_night/</a>.</p>  <p>The footbridge now closes each night from 9:30 pm in the summer and from 7:30 pm in the winter, reopens at 6:30 am every day.  At least daytime usage of the footbridge continues to be toll-free, unlike the lock - for which a &pound;5 charge per boat was reintroduced in January 2010.</p>  <p>The lock telephone number is 020 8940 0634.</p>

    <p>Wow - yet another fascinating article!  I am embarrassed to say that I have lived in a houseboat just down from the lock for nearly three years now and never gave much thought to how it operates.</p>  <p>Thanks for continuing to enlighten us week after week.</p>

    <p>Thank you for an interesting article.</p>  <p>There is a drainage ditch running parallel to the Thames from Twickenham Bridge down to Kew Gardens&#39; Brentford gate.  Its purpose is to allow the flood water to drain away after high spring tides when the Old Deer Park becomes flooded.</p>  <p>Three independent sources tell me that this ditch is named the "Mini Ha Ha" or prehaps "Minehaha" but I cannot find any "official" documentation of this.  Does anybody know the origins of this name, are there any signposts referring to it anywhere, or anything else?</p>  <p>Thanks,  Ed</p>

    <p>Ed: this is a poetic pun on the word &#39;ha-ha&#39;:</p>  <p>&#39;ha-ha, n.2 Etym:  &lt; French haha (17th cent. in Hatzfeld &amp; Darmesteter) &#39;an obstacle interrupting one&#39;s way sharply and disagreeably, a ditch behind an opening in a wall at the bottom of an alley or walk&#39;; according to French etymologists, &lt; ha! exclamation of surprise. a. A boundary to a garden, pleasure-ground, or park, of such a kind as not to interrupt the view from within, and not to be seen till closely approached; consisting of a trench, the inner side of which is perpendicular and faced with stone, the outer sloping and turfed; a sunk fence. . . 1712    J. James tr. A.-J. D&#233;zallier d&#39;Argenville Theory &amp; Pract. Gardening 77   Thorough-Views, call&#39;d Ah, Ah,&acirc;&#128;&yen;are Openings&acirc;&#128;&yen;to the very Level of the Walks, with a large and deep Ditch at the Foot&acirc;&#128;&yen;, which surprizes&acirc;&#128;&yen;and makes one cry, Ah! Ah! from whence it takes its Name.&#39; [OED]</p>  <p>This ditch is a kind of ha-ha; 100 years ago every schoolboy knew about Minnehaha:</p>  <p>&#39; . . In the land of the Dacotahs Lives the Arrow-maker&#39;s daughter, Minnehaha, Laughing Water, Handsomest of all the women. I will bring her to your wigwam, She shall run upon your errands, Be your starlight, moonlight, firelight, Be the sunlight of my people! . . &#39;</p>  <p>Hiawatha; a poem, by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/LonHiaw.html">etext.lib.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/LonHiaw.html</a></p>

    <p>Word from one of the lock keepers is, that due to additional work being required on the weir sluices, the annual draw-off has been extended until 25th December when the gates will close at approximately 17:00.</p>

    <p>Minehaha was an enchanting stream by old deer park in Richmond. It was an over flow from the Thames. I remember the Thames overflowing many times as a child and the flood water going into minihaha. Many a  time as a child I walked with my father over the little bridge to the tow path and fished for stickleback in its water.  The babbling water often sounded like laughter. Is that where the name came from. I am now in my sixtys but still remember it well.</p>

    <p>Im previously of St Margarets and have childhood happy memories. Yes I remember the Mini Ha Ha and the sticklebacks! Opposite the Lock I used to fish with my home made bamboo cane, cotton and safety pin for the hook.  Never caught anything. Always hankered to return from here near Norwich. Brilliant site thank you.</p>

    <p>A very interesting read as i lived on a house boat when i was a child at Thisleworth marine from i think 1972 to 1978 and attended Worple road Junior School. I would haved crossed richmond lock hundreds of times on our way to richmond outdoor pool and the golf course to wind the golfers up by pinching their balls after a good drive down the fairway. very interesting facts about the bridge that i knew nothing about its history, my older brothers occasionally would jump off the bridge into the water. we always knew the little river parralel to the thames as The mini HaHa aswell. In the summer we would pick berries and drop them off the bridge onto people in the river cruisers upsetting many people but at the time it seemed very funny.</p>
