    <p>Yup, many a grey Sunday afternoon with my Dad and siblings stickleback fishing in the Minnehaha in the seventies with the bamboo rod and net - had almost forgotten it&#226;&#128;&#153;s name! Trying to remember it brought me to this page.  Dad said it&#226;&#128;&#153;s name came from Hiawatha too.</p>

    <p>Can anyone tell me if they have heard that there are 2 trees(?) next to the minihaha between which the last dual in London was held...?  I have been told this tale, not sure if it is true.</p>

    <p>One of my relatives worked for Ransomes &amp; Rapier in Ipswich - this was the company that produced the ironwork for the bridge.  I have a small booklet celebrating the inauguration of the bridge dated 19 May, 1894 by HRH The Duke of York, accompanied by HRH The Duchess of York, HRH The Duke of Cambridge, HRH The Princess Mary, Adelaide, Duchess of Teck and His Highness the Duke of Teck.  Accompanying the document is a photo taken on 10 May 1894 when all the sluices were closed for the first time.  I am assuming my relative attended the celebrations because he worked for Ransomes &amp; Rapier.  Happy to share photos of this to anyone interested.</p>
