    <p>Ben Khosa doing the bhangra is a sight to see - he is still enviably agile for a man of mature years. Bhangra is traditional Punjabi male folk-dance; the New Grove Dictionary of Music says: &#39;Boli (improvised couplets) make up the principal dance-song for the men&#39;s bhangra and women&#39;s gidda dance... Here the soloists accompany their recitative with mimetic gestures and the group dances in a circle while singing the refrain.&#39;; and the Virgin Directory of World Music says: &#39;Bhangra is traditionally danced by men, and its boisterous, hedonistic, slang lyrics make it an attractive entertainment even to non-Punjabis.&#39; Not to be missed!</p>
