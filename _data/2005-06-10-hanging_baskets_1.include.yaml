    <p>The hanging baskets have arrived in Crown Road and are going to look fantastic. Thankyou to the Traders for organising this. Do you think that the Council would paint the lamposts?</p>

    <p>Thankyou for your comments, we have had many positive comments concerning the baskets but unfortunately they do highlight the poor condition of the lampposts. The council has a programme for painting lampposts, the traders association did ask in March for the lampposts in St.Margaret&#39;s to be &#39;pushed up the list&#39;. We&#39;ve not heard back from the council and will ask again this week. Thanks again for your comments.</p>

    <p>It&#39;s great to see St Margarets with these new hanging baskets. It really makes the village look bright and cheerful and is a real asset. May it go from strength to strength in the years to come.</p>

    <p>I look forward to competing in Britain&#39;s Best Kept Village competition!  Well done to all involved, the baskets look great.</p>
