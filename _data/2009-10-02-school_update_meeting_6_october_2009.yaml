    <p>This meeting, like Nigel Cannings&#39; previous one on the same issue in July, clashes with a meeting which the ward councillors must attend, their Joint Area Consultation Meeting [ACM] and Police Liaison Group (PLG) meeting for St Margarets &amp; North Twickenham <a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/event/meeting/200705142236">www.stmgrts.org.uk/event/meeting/200705142236</a> and for Twickenham Riverside <a href="http://www.richmond.gov.uk/calendar_of_meetings?mgl=ieListDocuments.asp&amp;CId=233&amp;MId=2306">www.richmond.gov.uk/calendar_of_meetings?mgl=ieListDocuments.asp&amp;CId=233&amp;MId=2306</a> . I recall that the St Margarets Community Action Plan Survey Results Night -[15th Sept] was also called for a date that the councillors couldn&#39;t attend.</p>  <p>This seems to me to be [to put it as politely as I can] not the most sensible way for residents to go about getting what they want. Ward councillors are their elected representatives.  They are up for election next May, so they are highly motivated to do their best for their electors. Why not use them?</p>  <p>It is simple matter to check the Council&#39;s Calendar of Meetings, which is published far in advance at: <a href="http://www.richmond.gov.uk/calendar_of_meetings">www.richmond.gov.uk/calendar_of_meetings</a></p>

    <p>Chris,</p>  <p>I agree, this is unfortunate.  Do you think one of the three councillors could attend the schools meeting, leaving two for the ACM?</p>  <p>Peter</p>

    <p>This is the only night that Winchester Hall is available, and the invitation has been extended for several weeks now.</p>  <p>No-one at the Council is willing to attend, least of all Cllr Eady in whose lap this falls.  His response at this stage is that the parents should keep quiet, and leave this between the Council and the school.</p>  <p>There are a number of serious, unanswered questions, particularly as to why St Stephen&#39;s is the only school that does not have sufficient budget to perform a reasonable rebuild or refurbishment.</p>  <p>That the sums don&#39;t add up is not the fault of the architects (who are happily engaged at Chase Bridge), nor is it the school being unreasonable.  Simply, there appears to have been a miscalculation in the original budgeting that failed to take account of the VAT issue facing a Church school, and the real difficulties of an urban site in a suburban location.</p>  <p>Yes, that&#39;s a pain for the Council, but ignoring it, or using emotional blackmail is not the right answer.  We&#39;re seeing responses that imply it&#39;s either the crumbs we give you because (I quote) "it is a far better option than having to offer school places to local children in schools in North Sheen or Whitton."</p>  <p>The parents will not shut up about this, and if no-one on the Council side is willing to make a move to face the parents, reluctantly we will go ahead without them.  Up to now, parents (perhaps apart from myself), have been taking a constructive approach with the Council, but we are beginning to hit a wall of platitudes.</p>  <p>Time&#39;s running out, and if this has to turn from constructive engagement to a fight, I can assure everyone that there have been weeks of careful fact-checking and true engagement beforehand to give the Council the chance to make things right.</p>  <p>As Peter says, not everyone is required at every Council meeting, and we don&#39;t have the luxury of when facilities are available.  This is probably the most important issue in St Margarets at the moment, and is a hot potato in Borough education.  We want someone there to represent the Council.  I&#39;m sorry Chris feels that either we are too stupid or too devious to hold a meeting when someone from the Council can attend.  I can assure him that neither is the case.</p>

    <p>Cllr Geoff Acton will attend this meeting while Cllrs Ben Khosa and Philip Morgan do the ACM/PLG one. Which means I can stay at home! I hope you have a constructive meeting and that the issues Helen Henderson has raised can be properly dealt with.</p>
