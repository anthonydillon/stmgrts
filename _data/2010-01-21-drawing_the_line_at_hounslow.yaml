    <p>There is a fine photo of the General Roy monument, Hampton Hill, on the Geograph website for grid square TQ1370: <a href="http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/362666">www.geograph.org.uk/photo/362666</a></p>

    <p>I had no idea this kind of mapping started on our doorstep - amazing.</p>  <p>I can&#39;t recall seeing the trig point in Richmond Park - do you know where it is?</p>

    <p>The trig point in Richmond Park - UKTP 4851 - can be found at Latitude N51.26.701 Longitude W0.17.643 or on OS Map 176 Grid Ref TQ 18652 73160<br /> If your Sat Nav can&#39;t show you where it is, ask a Boy Scout!</p>

    <p>The OS map:</p>  <p><a href="http://getamap.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/getamap/frames.htm?mapAction=gaz&amp;gazName=g&amp;gazString=TQ185731">getamap.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/getamap/frames.htm?mapAction=gaz&amp;gazName=g&amp;gazString=TQ185731</a><br /> shows that it is close to but not on King Henry&#39;s Mount. I don&#39;t recall seeing it - perhaps it is concealed by a hedge?</p>

    <p>I think the Heathrow base-line marker is not actually in the exact position that it was in General Roy&#39;s time. I vaguely remember reading some scandalised comments from the 1920&#39;s when someone was remarking that the position had been left unmarked and the location was lost.</p>

    <p>Thanks for a fascinating article, Martyn. The original articles published by Major-General Roy are freely available on the Royal Society web site at the moment (Nov 2010), as part of their 350th anniversary, and contain lots of information including a detailed map of the baseline area in 1784. See the 1785, 1787 and 1790 Philosophical Transactions at <a href="http://rstl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/by/year">rstl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/by/year</a></p>

    <p>I found the Park trig point this afternoon; it is in the Park halfway between the hedge and the road by the all-weather track; it is now #3264 and part of the OS GPS network.</p>
