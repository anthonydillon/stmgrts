    <p>Our next door neighbour put a pumpkin lantern on our dividing wall so we prepared ourselves for interruption (but please not during Downton Abbey!) by having a bowl of clementines, sweets, twists of surprise treats (that took some time) and the result?  not one knock on the door.  Where were they all.  One neighbour suggested All Souls Church was to blame by having a party for the youngsters.  Wherever they were they didn&#39;t call on us.</p>

    <p>I came late to Trick or Treat when my wife decided that a Halloween party would be just the job for my son&#39;s Reception Class. Of course, it rained buckets but everyone went home happy and they were all talking about it in the playground the following morning - except the 2 who&#39;s parents objected.</p>  <p>A couple of years later, my 4 year old daughter joined in and off we went in pursuit of lighted "friendly" pumpkins.  That year we got a lecture on the evils of what All Souls Eve really meant from a woman in Claremont Road.</p>  <p>This year the children, now teenagers, left their embarrassing father at home and went all over the place with strict instructions to be polite to all and considerate of small children.  And finally this year we were properly "Tricked" with a smoke bomb through our letterbox, initially scary as I immediately thought it was a firework.  So there you are, after 12 years I have my just desserts.</p>  <p>Is it worth it?  Absolutely - the sense of community in St.Margarets is what makes it such a great place to live and long may it continue to defy the pressures of modern life.  Trick or Treat is mostly great fun for those who wish to partake and St. Margarets is just the place for it. Bring on the Crown Road Market!</p>
