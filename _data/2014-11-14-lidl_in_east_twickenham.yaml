    <p>I&#39;m very troubled by this development and hope the community can mobilise against it. My concerns are:</p>  <p>1) there are ample supermarket facilities in the Richmond/east Twickenham area and a further one is not needed;</p>  <p>2) a new supermarket would inevitably cause more traffic, and in this location - ie on the approaches to Richmond bridge, and close to the intersection of the riverside walks - this will be most unwelcome, esp at the weekend, creating a more hazardous and polluted environment, especially given the number of children;</p>  <p>3) there are many independent retailers in the area, and it can&#39;t be ruled out that a supermarket would deprive them of custom, and so compromise the current interesting and varied nature of the shopping experience in this area; and,</p>  <p>4) the approaches to Richmond bridge are attractive architecturally, with Victorian style mansion blocks, trees; a modern supermarket / flat complex would detract from this, especially given Lidl&#39;s gaudy brand and logo<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.</p>  <p>Additionally, I understand that Lidl has a very poor track record - even compared with most supermarket chains - with regard to employee relations<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>, union recognition, environmental protection and ethical sourcing<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup> and I don&#39;t feel that such a track record sits comfortably within the ethos and demographic in the Richmond area. It also has a complicated internal structure and is noted in the German media as being extremely secretive about its operations.</p>  <p>Finally, I also feel insufficient notice has been given regarding the public consultation evening scheduled for the 14th, which prevents a full and transparent debate.</p>  <p>[1] At the very least, if the plans unfortunately do go through, I hope restrictions can be put in place to ensure their signage is discreet and in sympathy with the area. <sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> You may be aware that from 2004, Ver.di, a 2.5 million strong German trade union, published a book called "The Black Book on Lidl in Europe" which detailed 3500 complaints from some of Lidl&#39;s 170,000-plus staff working in 23 European countries. This somewhat unprecedented action was prompted by Lidl&#39;s poor record in employee relations and examples include: hidden cameras being used to monitor staff, routinely asking staff in Portugal whether they were planning to have children for which it was fined, and so on. Lidl have asserted the book was full of errors, but were unable to satisfy the Guardian newspaper in the UK as to which overseas media actually retracted these allegations. <sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup> Asda, Lidl and Aldi come out bottom in the study by Consumer Focus, the Government-backed watchdog, with D grades, in 2009, as reported by the Daily Telegraph,  "Supermarkets &#39;dismal&#39; ethical record".</p>

    <p>Not everyone wants or can afford to do all their shopping at Waitrose, Sainsburys or Tesco. There is no local Morrison or Aldi. Or even a Co-op for that matter.</p>  <p>I look forward to having a local branch of Lidl.</p>

    <p>Just looked at plans, architecturally the flats look ok but the shop looks cheap and nasty brick, with a terrible entrance. I think the area needs to be regenerated, but I am not sure this is the best scheme.</p>  <p>There is an local ASDA already, so we are sorted for cheap fish fingers already.</p>  <p>I am also not sure what is the main driver for Lidl who normally open opposite the other brands. I think this is about property development opportunities, and the bucket of additional money they will make out of our area, the shop could well be secondary.</p>  <p>Their weight (lawyers) behind this might legally make it unstoppable, but what will they be doing for the community? Replace all playgrounds with 20 year maintenance contract, refurb pools on the park, provide a new sports facility, what?</p>

    <p>This matter will be decided on planning grounds only and not on the issues that Dave raises, interesting and important as they are. Anyone wishing to object should study the most recent application, for a hotel, which was refused:</p>  <p>Planning application number: 12/1001/FUL Ryde House 391 Richmond Road Twickenham TW1 2EF <a href="http://www2.richmond.gov.uk/lbrplanning/Planning_CaseNo.aspx?strCASENO=12%2F1001%2FFUL">www2.richmond.gov.uk/lbrplanning/Planning_CaseNo.aspx?strCASENO=12/1001/FUL</a></p>  <p>The officer&#39;s report recommended permission but the committee refused it. The minute of the meeting, 04/04/13, is at:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.richmond.gov.uk/calendar_of_meetings?mgl=mgAi.aspx&amp;ID=25971">www.richmond.gov.uk/calendar_of_meetings?mgl=mgAi.aspx&amp;ID=25971</a> It sets out the reasons in full.</p>  <p>I thought that a hotel, which didn&#39;t affect me adversely in any way, would be an asset to East Twickenham, not least because it would have brought trade to local businesses, particularly cafes and restaurants. So I was disappointed that the developer didn&#39;t appeal.</p>  <p>Instead we get a supermarket most of us don&#39;t need - though I accept there are some who will welcome it - which will add to the near gridlock we have already and an overdevelopment of flats. I suppose I might be glad to end up living in one in my declining years so I will remain neutral.</p>

    <p>I&#39;m against it from the perspective of traffic and parking issues, this road is already gridlocked at peak times, as well as it&#39;s out of character for the road which is made up of small businesses.</p>

    <p>I&#39;m with Tom on this one,  not everybody is affluent just because we live in St Margarets, I have lived here for nearly 50 years, and since then the place has become overrun with Nimby&#39;s, all newcomers  seem to do is think of themselves and object to everything that is put forward.</p>  <p>As a pensioner, (There are still some of us left# and there are also young families who are struggling,  I sure both sets of us would welcome the Lidl store, we can&#39;t afford to pay Waitrose, Sainsbury or even Tesco prices, so this development sits well with us.</p>  <p>Let the more well off use overpriced local shops and the like, but don&#39;t forget not all people who live in "The Village" #estate agents jargon) can afford it.  I will give it my full support and encourage all to do likewise.</p>

    <p>I think it&#39;s a marvelous idea! Too many coffee shops, restaurants and curiosity shops have made the area feel cheap, tacky and run down. Unfortunately, the local &#39;snobbery&#39; brigade are responsible for the area&#39;s mish mash of tatty outlets over a 20 year period. En masse, they have made vulgar amounts of money on the back of the property boom and like locusts they, have stripped away the communities of conventional retail outlets along the way. They shop online (unless of course, they can drag themselves to Waitrose) which has forced out major shop chains. Gradually, they drove out McDonald&#39;s. This was despite the fact McD&#39;s poured a lot of money into the local community. The dire consequences of this property boom hit Twickenham, Whitton, St Margarets  and  Teddington most. For many years are these areas were nothing more than run down looking high streets. Greed from the &#39;snobbery&#39; has reigned ever since. Fast forward to the present, we now have M&amp;S and Waitrose adorning Teddington and Twickenham. Did the &#39;snobbery&#39; brigade protest? Of course they didn&#39;t. Yet when Poundland found  foot in Twickenham, there were all manners of complaints despising their presence. Whitton High Street was in a pitiful state, 3 years ago. If it was not for the presence of Lidl, a derelict building nesting huge colony of rats would have continued to multiply. Yet again, the &#39;snobbery&#39; brigade including MP Vince Cable opposed the very idea of a Lidl store, but they lost.Thankfully. Whitton now looks aesthetically pleasing and has helped encourage further retail growth by the future presence of a Sainsbury store. A Lidl store in East Twickenham will enhance a flagging community and will inject much needed local employment. Not that this is likely to bother the local &#39;snobbery&#39; brigade, because they either work for themselves from home, or they work in The City. When they talk of the &#39;environment &amp; conservation&#39; they will  most likely to be concerned about detrimental effect it will have on the price of their properties. Lidl, welcome to our community.</p>

    <p>Since 2010 East Twickenham has witnessed a steady deterioration with Richmond road now being the almost exclusive reserve of charity shops, fast food chains and tatty shops with no identity and nothing to offer. The best effort at reviving the shops has been putting fake plants outside shops. Frankly pathetic. I agree that people who have worked hard to buy properties in the area would rather a local community with a butcher, baker and all the amenities one would see in a thriving local community. I spoke to a local French bakery employee which shut after a year and her comment was that over the past year we have seen this road become all the more derelict and didn&#39;t really want to be associated with this part of town. Very sad.</p>

    <p>So a lot of people seem to be saying that the East Twickenham area is &#39;run down&#39; &#39;tatty&#39;, &#39;tacky&#39; and &#39;cheap&#39; - then in the same breath  bemoan the fact that there isn&#39;t a McDonalds or Lidl because of resistance by local snobbery.</p>  <p>These are then probably some of the worst arguments for the case of building a budget supermarket on this site. And the case is not one of encouraging &#39;investment&#39; in the area either. The question is really about suitability of the site and the quantity of supermarkets in the catchment area.</p>  <p>There are currently 7 supermarkets (local and giant) within 1.5 miles of East Twickenham (30mins walking distance or 10 minutes on a bus)</p>  <p>If St Margarets residents want a Lidl why not have one there? Next door to the &#39;overpriced&#39; Tesco. Then see how the snobbery of St Margarets strikes you...</p>  <p>If it&#39;s a question of expense then a quick poll shows that a tin of baked beans costs the same (to within 3p) at Sainsbury&#39;s, Morrisons (YES there is one and its just up the road in Twickehnham), ASDA (YES again - in Twickenham Ivy Bridge), CoOp (YES again - newly opened in Isleworth) Tesco and Waitrose. Of course I suppose Lidl doesn&#39;t actually sell a branded version eg Heinz.</p>  <p>But then I guess it&#39;s my snobbery making me choose that as an example. I really must remember to put on a bowler hat the next time I go up to &#39;the city&#39; in my BMW X5 - something all us self employed builders do in this area.</p>  <p>This site is simply not suitable for a chain supermarket regardless of the size. Nor was the one now occupied by Tesco in St Margarets really. Unfortunately big business will bulldoze it&#39;s way into any space it can find regardless.</p>  <p>There is no case for a Lidl in East Twickenham because we don&#39;t need 8 supermarkets. We don&#39;t need 7 either. This is not Nimbyism. The arguments for another supermarket regardless of who owns it are simply pointless.</p>
