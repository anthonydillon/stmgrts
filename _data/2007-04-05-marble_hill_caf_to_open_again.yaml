    <p>Delighted to hear the Coach House Cafe is to re-open.  I remember it when I was much younger.  I, with my friends, will soon be visiting it.  Thanks for all your efforts in getting it reopened.  Mrs. Mac</p>

    <p>Great news about the coach house re opening I hope to be a regular!<br /> I had no idea Diana had had a stroke and I am in admiration for your new ideas.<br /> The Suzy Lampugh Trust was a tremendous source of sensible and intelligent advice over many years for which I for one was very grateful. Thankyou for that and thank you for taking on the coach house I hope it works out for you.</p>

    <p>So pleased the Coach House Caf&#233; is open again. My fiancee and I were first through the door on Friday morning. Excellent coffee and friendly service.</p>  <p>Many thanks to Paul Lamplugh and his team for giving us back this little oasis.</p>

    <p>I was b. 71 years ago in Sidney Road, St. Margaret&#39;s. My Grandparents lived in Napoleon Road.  My Aunt and Uncle in The Avenue.  Happy days of going to Marble Hill Park, etc. etc. Did not know the cafe had been closed in the Coach House - we used to buy ice creams from there  prior to, or after, a Putt!!! and a walk down to the River.    When my dear Aunt passed away 10 years ago, the family and friends gathered there after her funeral and we set off balloons to remember her by - over the putting green and away up into the Heavens. A plane was just about to pass by too,  en route to Heathrow!! Do hope Mr. Lamplugh&#39;s wife is still with him and thanks to him and Jenni Dunn a treasured memory is still with us all. 0ur heritage  and past is all important. My very best wishes to you all.   From Christchurch, New Zealand.   Patricia Hammond.</p>

    <p>Hooray - thank you -  b. in Sidney Road  in 1936 &amp; my Grandparents lived in Napoleon Road &amp; my Aunt &amp; Uncle in The Avenue. Used to frequent Marble Hill Park so often and ice creams at the Coach House were a treat.  When our Aunt passed away 10 years ago we had a &#39;cuppa&#39; there, shed many a tear and sent balloons off over the putting green in her memory... Thank you Mr. Lamplugh and Jenni Dunn for the &#39;fight&#39; and so retaining our heritage and treasured memories.   Best wishes, from New Zealand!</p>

    <p>I&#39;m so glad that the cafe is re-opening.  I ran the cafe for four years from Feb 1998 to October 2001 and got to know the locals, their children and dogs well during this time.  I have very fond memories of that time and was very sad when I heard that it had been closed down in Feb 2003.  My very best wishes to Paul and Jenni.  Time for a visit!</p>
