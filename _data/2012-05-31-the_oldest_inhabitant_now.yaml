    <p>I felt so much reading this wonderful piece.  The appalling deprivation of Sonny&#39;s childhood which many like him would have taken for granted is not surprising. But his honourable decision not to potentially create a widow and fatherless children is remarkable.  It was nostalgic of course, but humbling at the way an "ordinary" man has lived what we might consider an "extraordinary" life.</p>
