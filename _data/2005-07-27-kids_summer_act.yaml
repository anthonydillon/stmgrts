    <p>Is this information out of date as I have spoken to a couple of the contacts you list, and they say that the information on your website is incorrect and out of date.  Can you let me know if this is the case, and if so, do you know of anywhere that I can get some information on Children&#39;s summer activities for this summer holidays?</p>  <p>Many thanks Claire</p>
