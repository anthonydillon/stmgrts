    <p>ALL DAY IT HAS RAINED</p>  <p>All day it has rained, and we on the edge of the moors Have sprawled in our bell-tents, moody and dull as boors, Groundsheets and blankets spread on the muddy ground And from the first grey wakening we have found</p>  <p>No refuge from the skirmishing fine rain And the wind that made the canvas heave and flap And the taut wet guy-ropes ravel out and snap, All day the rain has glided, wave and mist and dream, Drenching the gorse and heather, a gossamer stream</p>  <p>Too light to stir the acorns that suddenly Snatched from their cups by the wild south-westerly Pattered against the tent and our upturned dreaming faces. And we stretched out, unbuttoning our braces, Smoking a Woodbine, darning dirty socks, Reading the Sunday papers - I saw a fox And mentioned it in the note I scribbled home;</p>  <p>And we talked of girls and dropping bombs on Rome, And thought of the quiet dead and the loud celebrities Exhorting us to slaughter, and the herded refugees; -Yet thought softly, morosely of them, and as indifferently As of ourselves or those whom we For years have loved, and will again Tomorrow maybe love; but now it is the rain Possesses us entirely, the twilight and the rain.</p>  <p>And I can remember nothing dearer or more to my heart Than the children I watched in the woods on Saturday Shaking down burning chestnuts for the schoolyard&#39;s merry play Or the shaggy patient dog who followed me By Sheet and Steep and up the wooded scree To the Shoulder o&#39; Mutton where Edward Thomas brooded long On death and beauty - till a bullet stopped his song.</p>  <p>Alun Lewis (1915 - 1944) <a href="http://www.warpoets.org/conflicts/ww2/lewis/">www.warpoets.org/conflicts/ww2/lewis</a></p>
