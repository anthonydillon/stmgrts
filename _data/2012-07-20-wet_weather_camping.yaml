    <p>ALL DAY IT HAS RAINED</p>  <p>All day it has rained, and we on the edge of the moors<br /> Have sprawled in our bell-tents, moody and dull as boors,<br /> Groundsheets and blankets spread on the muddy ground<br /> And from the first grey wakening we have found</p>  <p>No refuge from the skirmishing fine rain<br /> And the wind that made the canvas heave and flap<br /> And the taut wet guy-ropes ravel out and snap,<br /> All day the rain has glided, wave and mist and dream,<br /> Drenching the gorse and heather, a gossamer stream</p>  <p>Too light to stir the acorns that suddenly<br /> Snatched from their cups by the wild south-westerly<br /> Pattered against the tent and our upturned dreaming faces.<br /> And we stretched out, unbuttoning our braces,<br /> Smoking a Woodbine, darning dirty socks,<br /> Reading the Sunday papers - I saw a fox<br /> And mentioned it in the note I scribbled home;</p>  <p>And we talked of girls and dropping bombs on Rome,<br /> And thought of the quiet dead and the loud celebrities<br /> Exhorting us to slaughter, and the herded refugees;<br /> -Yet thought softly, morosely of them, and as indifferently<br /> As of ourselves or those whom we<br /> For years have loved, and will again<br /> Tomorrow maybe love; but now it is the rain<br /> Possesses us entirely, the twilight and the rain.</p>  <p>And I can remember nothing dearer or more to my heart<br /> Than the children I watched in the woods on Saturday<br /> Shaking down burning chestnuts for the schoolyard&#39;s merry play<br /> Or the shaggy patient dog who followed me<br /> By Sheet and Steep and up the wooded scree<br /> To the Shoulder o&#39; Mutton where Edward Thomas brooded long<br /> On death and beauty - till a bullet stopped his song.</p>  <p>Alun Lewis (1915 - 1944)<br /> <a href="http://www.warpoets.org/conflicts/ww2/lewis/">www.warpoets.org/conflicts/ww2/lewis</a></p>
