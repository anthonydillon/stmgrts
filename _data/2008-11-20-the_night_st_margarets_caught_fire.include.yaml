    <p>Thanks.  Very interesting and must have been a terrible event to live through.  It helps to put ones own minor troubles today into context.  Credit-crunch the end of the world? Maybe not.  The previous generation would rightly think we were all mad and lacking a stiff upper lip.  Which we are!</p>

    <p>I remember the night well!  I was 4 yrs 10 months old and woke up to find I was being carried downstairs to sleep under the stairs whilst the bombs dropped.  We were lucky as our house was not hit.  This was the only time I did not sleep in my bed.</p>

    <p>My Grandparents Frank Sharpin &amp; Margaret Mary were killed during these aforementioned attacks. Their Surname was Griffiths and they lived at 10 Wellesley Crescent. My father Alec Francis Robert Griffiths was flying for the RAF at the time. It seems that Margaret died 29th Nov 1940 and Frank died of his injuries the following day - 30th Nov 1940.   They were in their early 50s and it seems so sad as we have not ever seen a photograph of them!   I suppose all possessions were lost in the fires.</p>
