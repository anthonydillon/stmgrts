    <p>The Marble Hill becomes the Aleksander: The RTT reports today (p. 25) that the pub [by the park on Richmond Road] is to be renamed the Aleksander (for their 2-year old son) by the new owners, Roger and Magdalena Davy. It will be relaunched as a free house and family pub serving pizza and pasta on October 2.  A children&#39;s playground is promised.</p>
