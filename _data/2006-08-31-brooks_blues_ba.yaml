    <p>I really enjoyed the first venue on Thursday last week. It was a fantasticly professional performance with both guitar and harmonica rythm and solos I never thought possible. The venue was run with a relaxed and friendly atmosphere in the Winchester Hall.</p>  <p>I was surprised to find that there wasn&#39;t many local residents there, and knowing how many music lovers and players there are in our community I guess it is because the "word" has not yet got around.</p>  <p>I highly recommend this venue and look forward to this Thursday at 8PM, when they have a Blues artist over from the US performing.</p>
