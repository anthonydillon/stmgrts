    <p>During my search through local planning applications I came across the following.</p>  <p>Martha (aka Pattie) Wooldridge was one of the first to buy land from the Conservative Land Association who had bought Twickenham Park from the Earl of Kilmorey.</p>  <p>She bought 3 plots, one of 75 feet and two of 50 feet, adjoining each other.</p>  <p>William Morris designed a house for her and she called it Wavertree after the prosperous area of Liverpool with which she and her good friend Rev. Stuart Headlam who lived with her in Wavertree were associated.</p>  <p>She had the two smaller plots made into a sunken shakesperian garden, a tennis court, a bowling green and a croquet lawn.</p>  <p>Three years after Rev. Stuart died, in 1928 she felt that her savings needed to be conserved so she build a smaller house using the same design as Wavertree.</p>  <p>She called this house Stuart House.</p>  <p>Wavertree was bought by Lord Aukland, a member of the magic circle.</p>  <p>In 1955 Jim and Cherry Dempster bought Wavertree and got to know Pattie Wooldridge their neighbour who was by then 91 years old. Pattie told them many stories and showed them many photographs. Sadly, Pattie burned all her photos shortly before her death.</p>  <p>After Patties death Stuart House was sold and a new house was build on the shakesperian garden in between Wavertree and Stuart House. The owners named the house Brittas. (after Brittas Bay in Ireland)</p>  <p>The sister of comedian Terry Thomas, herself a very amusing lady, lived in Stuart House for many years.</p>  <p>The above information comes from a book (Grounds for Celebration) written several years ago by some residents of the St Margarets Trust Grounds.</p>  <p>A copy of two pages from the book containing the information are attached to a comment on planning application ref. 08/3459/HOT proposing alterations and extensions to 22 St Peters Road, Stuart House.</p>

    <p>A deceased member of Twickenham United Reformed Church wrote a poem on Stewart Headlam which I reproduce here:</p>  <p>January 17th: Charles Gore All Souls, St Margarets, 1925</p>  <p>The day the venerable Lord Bishop Gore lately Bishop of Oxford, came to dedicate, the vestry of All Souls, St Margarets, put up in memory of Headlam (Stewart),</p>  <p>the people genuflected as he passed, in reverence for one pious as a saint. He sought to disabuse them: bid them praise the Cross that held the Saviour, not its paint;</p>  <p>yet the devotion that they felt for him, which only echoed what he felt for the Divine Son whom he served, outlives him, helps us genuflect with equal piety.</p>

    <p>I have read this article with interest as I have just finished taking an inventory of books bequested by Stewart Headlam to the Library of the Royal Academy of Dance. As I also lived for several years just  a few minutes away from St Margarets it is fascinating to discover this further connection.</p>
