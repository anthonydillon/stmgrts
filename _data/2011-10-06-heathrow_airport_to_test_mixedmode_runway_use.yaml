    <p>I wonder how BAA came to the figure of 150,000 homes.  Having not received a leaflet I can only presume that we are deemed unaffected.</p>  <p>Whilst the daytime noise is indeed a nuisance, the very early morning (4am-6am) flight arrivals cause a substantial disturbance to sleep.  It is harder to find out where these come from as they are removed from the "arrivals" board by 7am, but the main culprits (in approximate arrival order) are:</p>  <p>BA026 - Hong Kong<br /> BA012 - Singapore<br /> BA212 - Boston<br /> BA028 - Hong Kong<br /> BA074 - Lagos<br /> QF009 - Melbourne via Singapore<br /> VS201 - Sydney via Hong Kong<br /> BA016 - Sydney via Singapore<br /> CX251 - Hong Kong<br /> MH002 - Kuala Lumpur<br /> BA106 - Dubai<br /> BA064 - Nairobi<br /> SQ322 - Singapore<br /> UA958 - Chicago<br /> BD775 - Jeddah via Riyadh<br /> BI097 - Brunei via Dubai</p>

    <p>Hmm, no sign of a leaflet where I am either (the trust grounds area in St Margarets) and we are definitely effected by plane noise there, not as bad as Hounslow of course but still definitely effected.</p>
