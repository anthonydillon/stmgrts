    <p>I wonder how BAA came to the figure of 150,000 homes.  Having not received a leaflet I can only presume that we are deemed unaffected.</p>  <p>Whilst the daytime noise is indeed a nuisance, the very early morning (4am-6am) flight arrivals cause a substantial disturbance to sleep.  It is harder to find out where these come from as they are removed from the "arrivals" board by 7am, but the main culprits (in approximate arrival order) are:</p>  <p>BA026 - Hong Kong BA012 - Singapore BA212 - Boston BA028 - Hong Kong BA074 - Lagos QF009 - Melbourne via Singapore VS201 - Sydney via Hong Kong BA016 - Sydney via Singapore CX251 - Hong Kong MH002 - Kuala Lumpur BA106 - Dubai BA064 - Nairobi SQ322 - Singapore UA958 - Chicago BD775 - Jeddah via Riyadh BI097 - Brunei via Dubai</p>

    <p>Hmm, no sign of a leaflet where I am either (the trust grounds area in St Margarets) and we are definitely effected by plane noise there, not as bad as Hounslow of course but still definitely effected.</p>
