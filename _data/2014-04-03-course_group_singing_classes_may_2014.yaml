    <p>I recently completed one of Helen&#39;s five-week singing courses, and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Although I am strictly an amateur singer and community choir member, I learned a great deal about breathing, posture, vocal production and listening while singing with others.  This will all be of great help in my future choral activities.  I recommend it.</p>

    <p>Even in a group setting, Helen manages to deliver a very personal learning experience. Her sessions are fun and informal, yet highly informative. A ray of sunshine in my week - thoroughly recommended!</p>
