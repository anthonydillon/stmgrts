    <p>What a brilliant idea! I am not pregnant and I don&#39;t have a baby under 1 (my eldest is almost 30) BUT I have just done a 2-week mindfulness course. I can see how it would have been a very useful tool to have had when I was at that stage of life.  So, my advice is, don&#39;t hesitate, give it a go - you can never have too many tools in your toolkit for life.</p>
