    <p>I got a letter from the council concerning the hearing and requesting that any representations be made in person. Should be interesting to further understand in what the spirit group deem to be relevant and irrelevant considerations!</p>  <p>Does the spirit group see the concerns of local residents objecting to longer opening hours as antisocial irrelevant? That I must see for myself on the 22nd March.</p>  <p>Smacks of a half hearted attempt to me by the spirit group. Epescially as they appear to have lodged identical appeals in every other district that they operate licenses. Not sure how the relevant councillors will feel when they decision has been so baldly described as "wrong"</p>  <p>Anyone else going to attend?</p>  <p>James Thompson<br /> The Barons</p>

    <p>The Spirit Group also own the Ailsa Tavern but have not put in an appeal there, so this may be a serious attempt for longer hours. It must be worth people turning out to show the magistrates their strength of feeling.</p>

    <p>I&#39;ve also heard from the Council&#39;s Legal department about Spirit&#39;s decision and have been asked to give evidence based on my original objection letter last year. I&#39;ve also been asked to keep a log book of any incidents. Presumably other obejectors have also been asked this.</p>  <p>I am annoyed to have to do this as I have nothing against the pub per se - only against these extended hours which are bound to cause problems and exarcabate the disturbance that is already common enough.</p>

    <p>Have also received a letter from Council&#39;s Legal dept asking to give evidence.</p>  <p>Disappointed at lack of information / co-ordination.</p>  <p>Maybe this site will help to canvass / present views of the majority of residents.</p>

    <p>I also thinks its odd that those that objected are now required to submit a log detailing any incidents that have arisen since the orginal application. QUite what that has to do with extension of opening hours is beyond me. I put this to the council when I  spoke to them yesterday and she was relatively sympathetic indosfar as this is now a matter for the court etc.</p>  <p>Anyway, whoever did the leaflets last time can they do it again as I am concerned that the court appearnace will put a lot of people off either attending or at the very least reconfirming their original views - which the spirit group deem irrelevant.</p>  <p>Those that feel they will be adveresly affected by the proposed extension PLEASE do what you can to attend or submit your views again in writing to the council and they i am sure will forward to the court for consideration.</p>  <p>WIll check again with the council today and post any further info</p>  <p>James Thompson</p>  <p>The Barons</p>

    <p>I have also agreed to attend the magistrate&#39;s court to give evidence.  Like Maeve I&#39;m not happy about having to do this as I don&#39;t revel in the role of &#39;complainant&#39; and have no problems with the pub in general.  However, I find the noise from the pub during the warmer months when people are seated outside and they have their doors and windows open a real problem - and the thought of this going on later into the night unbearable.</p>  <p>I plan to give the council&#39;s legal department a call to find out how many residents will be attending to give evidence.  As there were 60 odd objections originally not everyone can be attending and it would be good to know that those of us that are attending are representing the views of all those concerned.</p>

    <p>I have also been asked to give evidence.  I have not yet decided whether to do so.  The Spirit Group&#39;s appeal is so vague that it is impossible to know what we will be arguing against. Like Maeve and Debra, I have no general problem with the pub and, indeed, drink there occasionally, but as I live by the pub I find the landlord&#39;s request for longer opening hours shows a disregard for the wellbeing of residents of the local community. There is frequently noise at closing time (car doors and shouting) - whilst this may be acceptable at 11.30, at 12.30 or later it will have an inevitable impact on the ability of residents to sleep. St Margarets is a residential area, not a town centre.</p>
