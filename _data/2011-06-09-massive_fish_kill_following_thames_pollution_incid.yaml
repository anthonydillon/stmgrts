    <p>The pressures we place on the River Thames and its habitats are immense, and despite the likes of anglers and boaters (plus other recreational users), and the risks we face, the aquatic life continues to suffer through pollution, proposed hydropower projects, eroding habitat, flow regimes, migration, abstraction of water, poaching, illegal netting, predation, disease, endocrine-disrupting compounds etc. etc. etc.</p>  <p>This cannot continue, and rather cynically I believe that Thames Water will use this to further their position concerning the objections (by some members of the community), that are voicing opposition to the Thames Tunnel being built.</p>  <p>Incidentally, as a concerned group representing anglers on the Thames, the Thames Anglers&#39; Conservancy believe that the tunnel should be built sooner rather than later, but, it won&#39;t be the privately owned company that will pay for the project, it will see an additional annual increase to their consumers bills on an annual basis to the tune of &pound;60, at least.</p>  <p>This for a company that is owned by an investment banking group - Macquarie Group - based in Australasia, that boasts of a &pound;140bn portfolio... that earned &pound;435mn out of Thames Water alone in 2009.</p>  <p>Utterly disgusting and immoral, but not so surprisingly, the previous Conservative Govt. made this practice legal through "temporary" discharge consents in 1989 when they sold off the water utilities to private ownership.</p>  <p>This happens in varying amounts of discharge nearly once a week on the Thames alone, averaging 39 million tonnes (or 39 million litres) per annum...</p>  <p>And here&#39;s another notification by Thames Water today;</p>  <p>Within the next hour and a half, Hammersmith Sewage Pumping Station will be discharging heavily diluted storm water into the River Thames.</p>  <p>We regret the necessity to discharge partly treated effluent in this way.</p>  <p>Until this essential work is done, London&#39;s sewer network - which is Victorian - and other facilities will remain overstretched. This means that after heavy rain there is simply nowhere else for excess storm sewage to go, which is why these discharges, though regrettable, are legal and consented.</p>  <p>Regards<br /> Thames Water</p>  <p>And so it continues...</p>
