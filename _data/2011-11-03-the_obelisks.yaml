    <p>I have always wondered whether the King&#39;s premature observation of the touching of the disk made all the other Kew observers agree with him and so all their readings were invalid. I suppose it must be difficult to stand your ground against George III.</p>  <p>Still it is supposed to be a difficult thing to time accurately as the atmosphere on Venus creates a "black drop" and the judgement of when the images touch is more subjective that was hoped for.</p>
