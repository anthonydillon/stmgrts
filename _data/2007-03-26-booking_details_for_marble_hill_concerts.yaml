    <p>Is it only me, or has there been an ongoing inverse relationship between the quality of these concerts and the price since IMG became involved (and i&#39;ve been going to them for 15+ years) ? &pound;30 to sit on the grass half a mile away from the stage and listen to over-amplified has-beens? No thanks.</p>
