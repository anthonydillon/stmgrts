    <p>Two points to be taken into consideration:</p>  <ol> <li>If CPZ is only introduced in selected roads, it will again just shift the problem to the remaining "non-CPZ" streets.</li> <li> Currently, parking on corners stops fire engines being able to get through.  This is a dangerous place to live! And I&#39;m sure our insurance premiums reflect this!</li> </ol>  <p>We need a solution... not just HALF a solution</p>

    <p>Mr Robb, in my opinion you made three valid points</p>  <p>Have you got any suggestions that might lead to the solution while we make do with what you call<br /> just half a solution?</p>

    <p>There is no magic wand, and I do not mean that flippantly and we can only play the hand we are dealt with.<br /> The council is encouraging walking,cycling and car clubs as a way to reduce miles driven and the number of cars</p>  <p>Cllr Ben Khosa</p>

    <p>As for (2) above: To stop street corners being parked on, double-yellow lines can be placed on those corners without the need to introduce CPZ controls next to them.  If the suggestion here is people will park on double yellow lines anyway, then the CPZ would make no difference either.  I don&#39;t see this safety issue tying convincingly into CPZ restrictions.</p>  <p>In the proposed areas, CPZ controls are revenue earners for the Council and private contractors only.  It&#39;s an additional tax on us, the homeowners, where the CPZ streets will be full of our cars still anyway, except we&#39;re all poorer.  I used to live in a CPZ in Twickenham (for 3 years), and parking was still difficult, except we were all out of pocket by &pound;70 a year for the privilege.  I don&#39;t see the real issues faced in the centre of Twickenham to be valid in the North St. Margarets area (communter parking, shopping, etc.).</p>

    <p>Ben, so our council is encouraging the residents to walk, cycle and join car clubs.</p>  <p>Very commendable, but exactly why? is my question.</p>  <p>Walking and cycling is good for the residents health and CO2 reduction I agree but has precious<br /> little to do with solving the parking problem in St Margarets.</p>  <p>While residents are walking and cycling their cars<br /> are parked on the road.</p>  <p>Using my own circumstance joining a car club is out the question.<br /> Financially certainly a disadvantage.<br /> Availability of a car nearby and as and when I want it is questionable.</p>  <p>If the council is really concerned about reducing<br /> miles driven and solving parking problems roads<br /> north of the A316 that voted for a CPZ and adjacent roads should be included in stage 2 consultation.</p>  <p>It is important that roads that at stage 1 voted<br /> NO are included in stage 2 if they are adjacent to a road that voted YES at stage 1.  Both north and south of the A316.</p>  <p>The action taken by the council with regard to roads north of the A316 contravens the councils<br /> policy.</p>  <p>Meaningful discussions on how to reduce the volume of cars parked on St Margarets Roads will not be entered into by residents while there are<br /> still a small number of roads without a CPZ.</p>  <p>Like the CPZ in East Twickenham and St Margarets<br /> where initiated by residents moves to dicuss car reduction will come from residents.</p>  <p>Gerhard</p>
