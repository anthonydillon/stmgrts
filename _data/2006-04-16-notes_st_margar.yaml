    <p>Cars which appear to be abandoned should not simply be counted; they should be reported promptly to the Street Scene Fault Reporting system:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.richmond.gov.uk/home/transport_and_streets/motor_vehicles_roads_and_parking/abandoned_vehicles.htm">http://www.richmond.gov.uk/home/transport_and_streets/motor_vehicles_roads_and_parking/abandoned_vehicles.htm</a></p>  <p>&#39;We have six Street Scene Enforcement Officers. Part of their responsibilities is to inspect vehicles that are reported by the public, or they come across them on their daily patrols.</p>  <p>To be able to deal with vehicles as being abandoned certain criteria must be met for example: being untaxed, in an unroadworthy condition, its location, ownership information etc.</p>  <p>The Enforcement Officer will put a notice on the vehicle that warns the owner to claim the vehicle, as it is considered abandoned and that it maybe destroyed or removed. Depending on the condition of the car the owner will have either 24 hours, or seven days to claim the vehicle.&#39;<br /> . .<br /> &#39;This online report form is used to report any problem, fault or defect relating to abandoned vehicles, highways management, parks and open spaces, street cleansing, graffiti, street lighting, structures and trees.&#39;</p>  <p>The system works well but requires residents to be proactive in reporting faults.</p>  <p>I am myself sceptical of the Council&#39;s ability [in professional and legal terms] to specify and adopt a scheme proposed by what may be a chaotic public meeting for a 6-month trial.</p>  <p>This will be an interesting challenge for your new ward councillors after May 4. It may be that the outgoing councillors have raised expectations unduly, knowing that they are unlikely to be around after the election.</p>  <p>[For some reason the system doesn&#39;t recognise the carriage returns I inserted to indicate paragraphs]</p>
