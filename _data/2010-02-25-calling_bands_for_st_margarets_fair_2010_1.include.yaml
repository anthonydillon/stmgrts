    <p>You always used to hold the fair around July 17th, but this year July 10th as earlier like the last 3 years has clashed yet again with the Barnes Fair - Both excelleent fairs and as a St. Margarets resident I like very much to go to both which were always in past years on separate Saturdys. Many local residents like to go to both fairs but now yet again have to choose one - this is really rather foolish that you don&#39;t check the Barnes Fair dates and mke sure St Margarets doesn&#39;t clash this loses you many potential customers to attend the fair. Even though I&#39;m close to Moormeades Park I will choose the Barnes Fair as having the edge, since I&#39;m forced like many other disppointed people to have to make a choice. May of us hope you plan better next year....</p>
