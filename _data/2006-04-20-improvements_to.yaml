    <p>It is unfair on the local residents to say that the meeting was "not well represented". We were told very firmly by Mr Waugh who was expected to attend. See this extrast from his email:-</p>  <p>"PLEASE NOTE: This meeting is solely to review the best submissions for the play area refurbishment and no other issue will be discussed. Those who are interested are more that welcome to come along. If you have a child with special needs or there is something specific you would like to see in the new play area, this is the meeting to attend."</p>

    <p>Just to be fair, we said "attended" NOT "represented"... personally I think the people there were very considerate, thoughtful and gave Mr Waugh good direction; however, there were only nine adults and five children (by my count).</p>

    <p>It was a dreadful day to hold the meeting - I would certainly have been there, with my son, but we were away for Easter, as I would have thought a huge percentage of those interested in the subject</p>

    <p>Hosting a meeting at 6pm for parents with young children is madness. Meetings should be held during the day or when children are in bed.</p>
