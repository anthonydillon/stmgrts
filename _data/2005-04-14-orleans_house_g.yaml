    <p>Just to let you know that our work is now completed. The Coach House Education Centre was opened in 2006 and our phase 3 development work was competed in April 2008. This comprised improvements to the grounds, improved disabled access to the main gallery, refurbished Stables Gallery and a new cafe with heritage display.</p>  <p>I hope you will come along to visit!</p>
