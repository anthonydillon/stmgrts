    <p>Ah, Martyn, you make me nostalgic for even scenes I never saw!  Thank you for contributing so generously, and for writing so damned well.</p>

    <p>What memories, this was Keith Moon at his best, Great to see it again, What a show that was, I was there!! it was just a short walk over the bridge from St Margarets for me so I use to go there as much as possible, also eel pie island was a favorite of mine, and I&#39;m still living in St Margarets.</p>  <p>Great article, well done</p>
