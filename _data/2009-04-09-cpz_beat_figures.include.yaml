    <p>The figures for St Margarets Grove show that we do not suffer from excessive daily parking and that being included in the CPZ would make no difference apart from the extra cost. In fact the available parking spaces would be reduced</p>

    <p>The information given is dated November 2007.  Surely if a &#39;Beat Survey&#39; was undertaken now it would show more cars parked during the day on the roads not included in the CPZ expansion.  I live on Sidney Road, and know that if I use my car during the day and return before 4.30pm I may not be able to park on my road and probably none of the other roads excluded from the CPZ.</p>

    <p>I agree with Clare Wood that a survey taken in November 2007 is hardly current or relevant especially due to the changes in CPZ since then.  I also wonder how many of the cars parked in these roads in November 2007 whether day or night actually belong to residents of those roads?  Most I am sure, but I think the night time problem is exacerbated by non residents cars being left for long periods of time.  So close to a good rail link both into and out of town is bound to have it&#39;s attractions!</p>

    <p>Isn&#39;t the survey relevant if we are talking about getting rid of the whole CPZ?  Then we would be returned to this situation.</p>  <p>It is only if the Council allows &#189; a CPZ that it is less relevant.</p>

    <p>I agree with Clare. This is 2007 report is totally irrelevant seeing as we are now in 2009! I cannot get a park in Godstone Road at any time of the day but there are always spaces on roads such as Winchester Road with CPZ.  There is only one explanation therefore - the non CPZ roads are being filled by non-residents or people from neighbouring roads too tight to pay the parking costs for their CPZ controlled road!!!  This is a no-brainer and I cannot believe we are having to battle this one out.  SAY YES TO CPZ!!!!  Lucy Bearman.</p>

    <p>Mary&#39;s comment regarding bays across drives is not accurate.  I have spoken with the council and they confirmed that the residents in houses with drives will be given the option of having the bays continue across their drive or a single yellow line.  This makes me doubt other so called &#39;facts&#39;. I also agree with Claire.</p>

    <p>The figures for the Beat Survey are of little value as they cannot truly list how many people park in Godstone Road overnight that are not residents.  They may be from other non CPZ streets equally full or even people that cannot find parking within the CPZ and so dump on any available spot.  If the figures are meaningful it would indicate that the total pressure on spaces in Godstone Road is similar day and night.  Or if cars are rarely moved then why own them in the first place?</p>  <p>I suggest that the figures might point to a large turnover and constant pressure to find spaces, with little availability at any time.  Surely creating a CPZ in Godstone Road must ease the situation and at least residents unable to find a space will know it is neighbours who are parked rather than freeloading interlopers.</p>  <p>The comments about fines and excessive charges on the most polluting cars have some relevance but I would rather suffer these problems than put up with the existing unacceptable situation.  I am sure that working towards a greener society is something we all aspire to and so encouraging the removal of the most polluting cars is a worthwhile goal anyway. Roger.</p>

    <p>On another subject: It has been reported to me that traffic wardens, now hunting in packs, have been spotted snooping up and down South Western Road this week, taking notes of registration plates. They did not respond what they were up to when challenged. Just as a precaution I suggest residents ensure their vehicle does not extend over any lines. They have been known to lie on the ground at strange angles to get the most incriminating photos.</p>

    <p>A November 2007 report?  Shouldn&#39;t this be included in the November 2007 newsletter?  What&#39;s the point of sending this out now?</p>  <p>Oh...  I get it.</p>  <p>Vote yes on the CPZ.  Allow us to park in our own streets.  I hate having to think that I can&#39;t go out because I won&#39;t be able to park when I return.  It feels like bullying.</p>  <p>I want to be able to park where I live.  I don&#39;t think that&#39;s unreasonable.</p>  <p>We&#39;ve voted in the majority for this once already.  Please vote yes again, and let&#39;s not allow them to ignore the majority this time.</p>  <p>And if you don&#39;t live in a street that is voting over CPZ, then I don&#39;t think this is your debate.  If you want to get rid of CPZ entirely, then fight for that.  I just want to be able to park.  If you are only fighting this time round to limit CPZ, and exclude me from it, then you are not working in my interest at all.</p>  <p>The deadline is April 20th.  Get your yes votes in before then, and hopefully coming home will be a relaxing experience again.</p>

    <p>Apologies to all for the tardiness of these figures. Yes, they would have been more useful 17mths ago - before the previous consultation. Unfortunately, for some reason the Council were very reluctant to release them until well after the voting had closed, despite repeated requests.</p>

    <p>Benjamin - Mary is right... the Council refused to release this information... I only assume because it pointed out that the parking issue is far worse (~100 cars worse) at night than the day... something a CPZ can never help with.</p>

    <p>sorry if I&#39;m being a bit naive about this but I haven&#39;t really applied my mind to it before. Surely if the Council want us to make an informed decision it&#39;s an obvious requirement that they do a new survey now  - and give us the results - and then we can make our minds on the basis of some useful up to date information? I presume someone has tried this tack, but just in case ...</p>

    <p>another thought - if the Council won&#39;t do do the survey why don&#39;t we do our own, it wouldn&#39;t take too long and then at least we could present our information to everyone.</p>

    <p>Trotting out some figures nearly 18 months late indeed does seem a bit desperate.  In any case the proof, if it were needed, would be provided with our own eyes.  It is MUCH easier to park during the day now (in Winchester &amp; Bridge Road).  Why? Because we have a CPZ, because the white vans can&#39;t park there any more, and the commuters and the people who use the area as long-term parking for Heathrow.</p>  <p>I have long felt the anti-CPZ campaign is hectoring in tone and agree with others who ask why we continue to have this discussion.  Vote yes to the CPZ and let&#39;s move on.</p>

    <p>Does the `Beat Survey` reveal anything that residents where not already aware of?</p>  <p>OK, it confirms residents perception with numbers.</p>  <p>Did the survey establish where vehicles were registred to identify commuter vehicles and vehicles registred in other adjacent CPZ`s?</p>

    <p>This seems like a last desperate attempt by Mary and her dwindling little gang to fight against the CPZ.  She has made our lives hell in the last six months by scaring people last time.  I wish Mary would be upfront, is she actually a resident? how many cars she owns, which roads does she park them on, and what political affliation is she pushing with this cause.</p>  <p>I have never heard of a CPZ implementation taking so long to achieve</p>  <p>The fact of the matter is on Winchester and Broadway you can find parking at any time of day and night and then there is the entire S Zone to choose from if you get no joy.  Exactly as another contributor added, no white vans and long term parkers on these roads.</p>  <p>All I can say is vote YES YES YES!  and say goodbye to the stress of trying to find a space every evening or panicking to move your car in the morning.</p>

    <p>As stated above these figures are quite meaning less now and whilst I applaud Mary for her efforts I fail to see any direct benefit.</p>  <p>I would be happy to assist (<a href="http://www.richmond.gov.uk/home/council_government_and_democracy/democratic_processes_and_events/who_are_my_councillors.htm?mgl=mgUserInfo.asp&amp;UID=415">www.richmond.gov.uk/home/council_government_and_democracy/democratic_processes_and_events/who_are_my_councillors.htm?mgl=mgUserInfo.asp&amp;UID=415</a>)  with any resident survey if enough people wanted to carry one out but please note this would be a purely private thing as the Council will note, but not be able to consider this as a valid survey.</p>  <p>Jane&#39;s post above confirms my previous assertion that the people of St Margarets are not easily swayed by gutter non sense</p>  <p>Cllr Ben Khosa</p>

    <p>I&#39;m sure most residents know that a survey conducted in April 09 would still show more cars parked at night time in all roads than during the day because cars park on the yellow lines at the junctions overnight.  We only have to try to park during the day to see the disparity in roads with and without a CPZ in place.  We need a survey showing where the owners of daytime vehicles live to demonstrate the problem and over the years I have talked to people who&#39;ve been carrying these out but have never seen any results.  Perhaps Cllr Khosa could look into this at the Council. It is also clear that in such a densely populated road as Godstone Road, where I live, there won&#39;t be enough space for everyone to park outside their house day or night, but I would much rather residents have the benefit than commuters, Heathrow users or other non-residents.  And I believe that this discussion belongs to the people actually living in the CPZ consultation zone rather than our neighbours.</p>

    <p>Fully support the Pro CPZ campaigners. Sidney Rd is even more of a nightmare to park on since CPZ was introduced on Winchester and Bridge. Totally bemused as to why such a common sense decision is taking so long. VOTE YES for CPZ!!!</p>

    <p>With reference to Clare&#39;s point about surveys the Council uses outside consultants for beat surveys etc. but to find out where owners live would be very difficult as it would depend on owners volunteering information.</p>  <p>If people say in Godstone Rd wanted to analyse this further the way forward would be to walk up and down the Rd taking registration details about 4 times from early morning to late evening. These details could then be compared, like the council beat survey, making some assumptions and trying to roughly gauge the levels of commuter, visitor and resident parking. As Chris has pointed out time is running out</p>  <p>Cllr Ben Khosa</p>
