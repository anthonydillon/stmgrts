    <p>I&#39;m afraid you have it somewhat confused regarding the Running Fox swordmark.. It was a mark used by Samuel Harvey SH. and occasionally H. Inscribed inside the Running Fox outline. It was also used with the Shotley Bridge sword Factory on the Durham Northumberland border. In that case the Fox was not inscribed inside. The Fox is also confused with the Hounslow factory which did not use it...and in addition can often be seen confused with the Passau Wolf mark...which may have inspired the Fox originally in Solingen and transmitted to Europe when those persecuted German swordmakers left Germany in and after the 30 years war...and traveled via Holland to England....but that is about all.  An interesting way to learn more is to see <a href="http://www.mocavo.co.uk/The-Victoria-History-of-the-County-of-Durham-Volume-2-3/704590/320">www.mocavo.co.uk/The-Victoria-History-of-the-County-of-Durham-Volume-2-3/704590/320</a></p>
