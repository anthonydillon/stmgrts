    <p>I was very interested to come across this interview of James Harbor as he was my wife&#39;s great great great grandfather.  I would dearly love to see a copy of the original 1897 article or interview in the Richmond Herald and would be very greatful if a digital copy could be sent to my email address ( <a href="mailto:%72%6F%63%6F%6E%6E%6F%72%40%65%73%2E%63%6F%2E%6E%7A">roconnor@es.co.nz</a>).  Thanking you in advance. Robert O&#39;Connor Christchurch, NZ</p>
