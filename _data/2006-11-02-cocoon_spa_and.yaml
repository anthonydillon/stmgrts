    <p>I have just learned that Cocoon has closed down. I have 2 vouchers, 1 of which was recently purchased. Needless to say I am very upset that they have decided to close the business down without providing any warning to customers of their financial difficulties, leaving many people like myself out of pocket.</p>  <p>I understand that Jane Franks has recently returned from holiday (how nice! Did we fund that?) Perhaps she would like to comment on her plans to recompense those of us who bought Coccon vouchers in good faith but now unable to redeem them.</p>

    <p>I too have recently learned that has closed down. In May I bought a &pound;50 voucher for my Mum&#39;s birthday which she was going to redeem on her next visit to see me from the North. Obviously this is no longer possible (which I&#39;ve yet to tell her). I understand that there was a sign on the door when Cocoon first closed down - I only managed to walk past yesterday and there is now nothing on the door. Can anyone point me in the right direction as to how I can attempt to get a refund for my voucher? Is there a contact number I can call? Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks</p>

    <p>I also bought a &pound;50 voucher and have tried to call the number several times (020 8744 1001) to no avail.  I paid for the voucher using cridt card and compamysay they will reimburse if the company is not in hands of administrators.</p>

    <p>Dear Craig<br /> It does appear that you have an outstanding gift voucher to the value of &pound;50 still outstanding.  Could you please provide me with a contact number so I can then supply you with the numbers of the therapists who will honour the voucher for you.  Many Thanks.</p>

    <p>Dear Jayne<br /> I hope you had success sorting out an appointment for your mother. Thank you for your understanding with regard to this.</p>

    <p>Dear Justin<br /> Having checked our records it appears that one voucher has been redeemed to the value of &pound;60. The second voucher does appear to have an expired on 24/6/08. The business didn&#39;t infact close until 7/7/08. However as a gesture of goodwill I will ensure that this voucher is honoured. And no you didn&#39;t fund my holiday, a trip to visit my sister in Italy, my husband did.</p>

    <p>My husband bought a Cocoon voucher for me in May for my birthday for a mother to be massage - I was saving this to use towards the end of my pregnancy (I am due in a few weeks). Hence I was very disappointed when I went to the shop a few weeks ago to make an appointment to find it had closed down. I would like to find out whether it is possible for me to use this voucher in the next few weeks and if so, how do I arrange doing this. And if not, can my husband get a refund? It would be helpful if you could provide me a number to contact you on to take this matter forward, thanks.</p>
