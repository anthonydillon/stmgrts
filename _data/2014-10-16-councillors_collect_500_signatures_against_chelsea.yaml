    <p>The article mentions 19 games.  Assuming good cup runs this could be closer to 29 games over a season.</p>

    <p>I can&#39;t see any problem with Chelsea FC at Twickenham, after all, It does not seem to bother people who live in the Kings Road Chelsea, and it&#39;s only for a limited time, it would bring in some good income for shops/pubs/food outlets and the like.</p>
