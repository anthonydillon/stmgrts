    <p>I&#39;m trying to understand what will happen with the 110 route.  I use it to get to West Middlesex hospital.   My route is from opposite Waitrose in London Road - I can park my mobility scooter at Waitrose and cross over to the bus stop - but if I can&#39;t get a bus that goes to the hospital door, I can&#39;t walk the distance between the 267 stop on the main road and the hospital door.  Am I to understand that this proposal will cut out West Middlesex Hospital from its route?  It&#39;s difficult enough to be disabled without losing one of the few available links to hospital care that offer me some sort of independence.  Please don&#39;t re-route the 110 away from West Middlesex Hospital!</p>

    <p>Having the 110 go through Twickenham up to West Middlesex Hospital has added a different dimension to travelling from Isleworth to Twickenham-If you miss a 267 you have the chance of a 110-But I will say, that they do seem to run together? I would like to see the 110 continue on this route but spread a little apart from the 267.</p>

    <p>I support the above comments about the proposed changes to the 110 route - the link to the Hospital is evidently vital for those who use it. I am also concerned about any diminution of service to the H37 north of the A316. This is a well used service out of peak hours too.</p>

    <p>I am opposed to any rerouting of 110, H22 and H37 buses. The travelling public needs these routes to remain as they are.</p>

    <p>Will the 110 route be via Castelnau, Church Road etc. or will it go via Lonsdale Road as the 419 does now.</p>
