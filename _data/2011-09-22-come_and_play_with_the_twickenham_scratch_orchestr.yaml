    <p>Hello Tim, I play Eb Tuba, reading bass clef, concert pitch.  I play with the Royal Hospital Band and have some experience playing orchestral music.  A friend of mine who also plays here is a vastly experienced and talented bass trombone player.  We are both interested in joining in with you in what sounds like a great way to spend a day of music.  We both played in the Festival Hall last year in that "Giant Orchestra" bash with Mars from the planets. Please let me know when the next performance is to be and we&#39;d love to join in.</p>  <p>Dave Simpson</p>
