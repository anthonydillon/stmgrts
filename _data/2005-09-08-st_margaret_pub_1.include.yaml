    <p>Could Cllr Hambidge give us information as to the hours applied for, as the application does not appear to be listed on the council website?</p>

    <p>Am not all that happy with the proposed extension as the pub is pretty noisy at closing time as it is, don&#39;t really see why a pub such as the St. Margarets needs to stay open till 2am? Seeing as the area is really residential and the pub is surrounded by homes does the management of the pub not care about how much noise and trouble this will cause?</p>  <p>St Margarets is a nice place to live and cannot see how residents can just sit back and watch the area become more of a late night venue??</p>  <p>I for one shall be raising an objection and suggest others that feel the same do so as well.</p>
