    <p>Where else in this or other boroughs does such a scheme operate?</p>

    <p>There is nothing new about free parking schemes in this borough or any other, the nearest &#39;free for 30 minutes&#39; scheme in operation is the one at the council offices car park at York Street Twickenham.</p>

    <p>Noted; what I meant was: are there any such schemes operating on public roads as against car parks? I think not. This is probably a significant point of difference. If you could find and point to such a scheme, it would strengthen your case considerably.</p>

    <p>"It would enable people to quickly call in for what they need and avoid having to find somewhere to buy a thirty pence voucher..."</p>  <p>Why don&#39;t ALL the traders sell vouchers? They are quite hard to find.</p>

    <p>I think most traders do stock vouchers, but the system is very inefficient. Find a space, park, buy a voucher, go back to the car then back to the shops. I can remember buying a voucher once in the last ten years. Either meters or pay machines should have been installed as per the far end of Heath Road, Twickenham.</p>  <p>I am not convinced the free thirty minutes is the best solution, but I hope it is given a trial.</p>
