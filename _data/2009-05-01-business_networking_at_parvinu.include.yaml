    <p>As Director of The Best of Richmond I was delighted to host our networking event at Parvinu who provided exquisite bites to eat for all our guests and I look forward to holding another event at this unique venue soon. Our aim is to showcase the best of local business and having Yellow Wedge provide a tasting was a fantastic addition to a highly successful event where we give local business owners the opportunity to form strategic alliances in a relaxing, social ambiance. It&#39;s nice to see that you can mix business with pleasure!</p>
