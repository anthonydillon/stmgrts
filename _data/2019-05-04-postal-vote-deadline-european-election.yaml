    <p>Good day,I am a duel citizen of the United Kingdom and United States, I lived in the UK for 68 years, I own a house in Pembroke Wales and live in it for 10 weeks every year. I have written to the electoral office in Milford Haven but they have not replied, which means I will miss out on voting in the European election. Any reason why they refuse to answer.</p>  <p>I look forward to hearing from you</p>  <p>Best regards</p>  <p>Anthony Gough</p>
