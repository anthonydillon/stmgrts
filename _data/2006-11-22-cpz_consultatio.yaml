    <p>Thanks Chris Squire for kick starting this debate.<br /> My information is that the Councils Cabinet is to make a decision on CO2 related charges late in January rather than the 15th soon after which consultation papers for the CPZ proposal will be finalised.<br /> These will go out in prioirity ward order as a que seems to have built up.<br /> Also all Roads in St Margarets not previously covered by a CPZ will be consulted and not just the "village".</p>  <p>Cllr Ben Khosa</p>

    <p>Is Richmond Council aware that  due to parked cars, emergency vehicles such as Fire, are not  always able to access our roads especially at night?<br /> A few months ago  at 10.30 p.m., it took a Fire Engine some 20 minutes to enter Moor Mead Rd from Godstone Rd and a similar time to then move to Hill View Rd.<br /> Perhaps our Cllr Ben Khosa could convince his collegues that this Health and Safety issue  deserves higher priority than CO2 related charges.</p>

    <p>As a near pensioner I look forward to my weekly visit to this web site, but I do find that I seem to have moved, when I came here 40 years ago it was just called St Margarets, my wife who was born here also has on her birth cert St Margarets, Reading Chris Squires piece on the CPZ we suddenly seem to have moved to a village, I did a quick Google for St Margarets Village and came up with Nova Scotia, Belize, Kent, but not Twickenham, can any of you enlightened younger set please inform me the date we became a village, as I can&#39;t find anything about it in the parish records at the reference library</p>

    <p>Gus</p>  <p>We have not missed any opportunity to highlight the problems (including what you mention) in this area to the relevant people and indeed as a direct result of that St Margarets is in the top group of wards to be consulted. There are also some very acute traffic problems in other parts of the Borough which the Council is also duty bound to resolve. The Council has been conducting a Borough wide review (which is now complete) of the criteria for any CPZs. It would do no harm for you to write in yourself to reinforce the strength of feeling to   <a href="mailto:m.potter@richmond.gov.uk">m.potter@richmond.gov.uk</a></p>  <p>With Christmas approaching and the CO2 charges not decided upon waiting till after the 29th January Cabinet meeting for a consultation will mean the residents will know better the financial implications of any CPZ.</p>  <p>If a CPZ is installed it will I understand automatically address the problem of parking on corners by installing double yellow lines but of course that will mean we will loose that many parking spaces.</p>  <p>How about Car Clubs with a view to reducing the total number of cars in the area.</p>  <p>Cllr Ben Khosa</p>

    <p>I am delighted that we will at last be allowed to have our say. Personally I am in favour but I am sure it will be squashed by the threat of removing around 80 spaces in the Moormead area( which was the number quoted some years ago when we were being told to shut up about parking). The only way a CPZ for the Moormead area would work would be if we were in the same zone as Cole Park Road where there is more than enough parking for scores of cars.I apologise in advance for this act of lese majeste.</p>  <p>Stephen</p>

    <p>Stephen&#39;s suggestion may well prove to be a good one, ex Councillor Trevor Whittol also brought this to our attention some time ago, I have forwarded it on to officers and will ensure it gets due consideration.</p>  <p>Cllr Ben Khosa</p>

    <p>Do previous contributors realise that St Margarets (Village or not) already has a CPZ - around Crown Road and beyond?</p>

    <p>I just would like to clarify the point that consultations regarding the CPZ proposals still have two weeks to run and will not be going to<br /> Cabinet until 29th January and this is not a delay. Would appreciate the headline amending and encourage people to respond.<br /> Geoff Acton</p>

    <p>Well it&#39;s March is there any other news on the St. Margarets (disappointed it&#39;s not a village) cpz. Has anyone thought of closing off Brook Road to stop the rat run? No sleeping policemen please. Would be interested as I&#39;m a St Margarets resident of Winchester Road. And have lived here man and boy.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
