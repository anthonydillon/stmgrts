    <p>"Every available empty shop in St Margarets has been filled, thanks to the efforts of the St Margarets Traders Association and Richmond Council."</p>  <p>Do leave off! There&#39;s no proof whatsover that the absence of vacancies has anything to do with SMTA or Richmond Council. Tenants come and tenants go, always have done and always will do. Some recently tenanted units have taken the best part of two years to re-let and realistically the odd few marketing ploys have really no effect on whether or not a trader decides to open in the area.</p>  <p>If the Council really want to assist traders the easiest means would be to change current CPZ regulations so that cars can be parked free throughout the day, save for say a one or two hour slot to prevent commuters from parking all day. This would also take parking pressure off those streets just outside the CPZ. I&#39;m sure the SMTA would agree to this, but the Council won&#39;t as it would cost them real money - not just the few grand contribution on bags which will amount to less than a half years&#39; rate income from just one shop in the area!</p>

    <p>I would not dismiss the St Margarets Traders Association and the Councils efforts as irrelevant but agree with Mike that &#189; hour or 1 hour free parking for shoppers will really make a difference to businesses and shoppers alike. Mikes assumption that limited time free shopper parking will take parking pressure of streets just outside the CPZ is wrong. These streets accommodate the commuter cars driven out of the CPZ areas for most of the day.</p>

    <p>Gerhard - it&#39;s dead easy to relieve parking pressure on streets outside the CPZ - just extend the CPZ to include them, but prevent commuter parking by having a one or two hour slot during the day strictly limited to residents&#39; parking.</p>
