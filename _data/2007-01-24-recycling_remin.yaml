    <p>The Council plans to add kerbside collection of cardboard and plastic bottles to the service in November. Much more important than this is to &#39;very substantially increase the proportion of residents participating in doorstep recycling from just over half to, say, 70%. This would increase the total recycling rate towards 50% . How can we achieve this? All the public consultation exercises showed over 70% of respondents in favour of making recycling mandatory. We will consider how best to put into practice this strong majority view.&#39; [Press release from Cllr Martin Elengorn, December 2006].</p>

    <p>It&#39;s all very well having a cardboard recycling plant by St Margarets Stn, has anyone tried using it lately?</p>  <p>Carlos from the greengrocers is the main culprit, he is continualy putting all his boxes in there, and when its full, dumps them on the ground, he is not the only shop trader to do this, I can see it all happening from my window!</p>  <p>I thought these small recycling plants were for householders only and not for traders, perhaps I am wrong, can anyone enlighten me please</p>

    <p>In answer to Alsie 42 comments regarding Carlos recycling cardboard I rang the Council&#39;s recycling dept. and they assured me that as it is a recycling centre EVERYONE, that means shopkeepers included, may use it.  Considering that Carlos is one of the most hardworking and conscientious shopkeepers in the dwindling shops in St. Margarets it would have been more polite if Alsie 42 had spoken face to face with Carlos and not commented through these columns  I feel an apology is forthcoming to him.</p>

    <p>Thank you for enlightening me with regards that everyone including shopkeepers can use the cardboard recycling, could we not then have a larger one, as its obvious that the present setup does not cope.</p>  <p>I Apologise to Carlos &amp; Family and anyone else I might have offended as I thought the public and shopkeepers had different arrangements for disposal of rubbish, I should have checked with the council first.</p>  <p>Sorry</p>

    <p>Thank you Alsie 42 for your apology which I am sure Carlos and family appreciate. The suggestion of a bigger cardboard - two banks - is a good idea and I will contact the Council and suggest it. Perhaps you can too.  Regards Mac</p>

    <p>I&#39;m afraid Carlos should not be using the recycling bank for commercial waste.  It is quite clear from the Council&#39;s website that recycling facilities are not to be used by businesses since they have to pay for their waste to be collected.  If someone has told him otherwise then they are mistaken.  Perhaps one of the current councillors could clarify the situation?</p>

    <p>I agree with Simon Lamb on this; see <a href="http://tinyurl.com/27zwf6">tinyurl.com/27zwf6</a> for an account of the &#39;The Council&#39;s current position on Commercial recycling&#39;. I can well believe that hard-working and consciencious traders like Carlos and Sandra have been too busy to read whatever bumph they may have received from the Council on this matter and may think that they are doing the right thing in using the bins provided for residents. However, they are mistaken and should stop.</p>

    <p>I think  Simon is right.</p>  <p>Being a small businessman myself I pay something like &pound;500 a year to Richmond Council to dispose off the trade waste from my shop in Whitton Rd.</p>  <p>The council charges a fixed amount and then depending on how many white sacks I use, which the council supplies, another charge is applied.</p>  <p>There are of course some cheaper private companies who do the same job and the Council do not dictate who you can and can&#39;t use.</p>  <p>The downside in this case would be that none of Carloss&#39;s cardboard would be recycled under the current commercial refuse collection system.</p>  <p>I will try and clarify next week as Simon suggests after speaking to officers.</p>  <p>Cllr Ben Khosa</p>

    <p>i am glad my recycling info has sparked off a debate but sorry that it has focused on hard working carlos &amp; his willingness to recycle his cardboard etc. he should be heartily applauded for doing his bit for the environment unlike many other residents who think it does not apply to them. the problem concerning commercial/domestic recycling needs to be sorted out once &amp; for all. i recall angelos in twickenham being taken to task by the borough for recycling their bottles in the &#39;residential&#39; bank literally across the road from the restaurant. that caused a furore which ought not to have happened. we all need to get into good recycling habits - our world is being destroyed right here &amp; now so we can no longer bury our heads (&amp; our refuse!) &amp; ignore these warning signs. everyone must participate, the time for choosing the easy landfilling option is over!! lee hearson</p>

    <p>I agree a common sense approach should be adopted and people should be encouraged to recycle not discouraged. I would not be too hasty in blaming Carlos for the overflowing bins either as demand in general for cardboard recycling at this site is likely to be high while we are waiting for domestic doorstep collection to start, and to this end I have asked officers to monitor the situation in St Margarets with a view to increasing the frequency of collection if the site is found to be consistently overflowing.</p>  <p>Domestic doorstep cardboard recycling should start by autumn this year together with plastics.</p>  <p>The council is currently in the final stages of putting together a trial commercial recycling service. It is hoped to introduce this service at the beginning of March 2007 for a 6 month trial.  Initially the service will be offered to the council&#39;s existing commercial waste customers rather than rolling out to new customers. Although in the future it may be rolled out to other customers too. The council will be collecting cardboard, paper and mixed glass. The businesses can refer to the following pages on the Council web page to find out more about companies that offer a recycling service <a href="http://www.richmond.gov.uk/commercial_recycling">www.richmond.gov.uk/commercial_recycling</a> By March you will also be able to ask questions via the contact centre number 0845 61 22 660 on how the trial is working.</p>  <p>Cllr Ben Khosa</p>

    <p>As explained the public sites are for residents, not traders, who do have a "Duty of Care" to dispose of their waste properly. We are checking to confirm whether or not Carlos (and other St M&#39;s traders) will be able to get involved.  There is a cost for the service, but it is less than the cost for general waste disposal. It is good to see people care about recycling cardboard and plastics and we are investigating further bring sites to alleviate the situation where popular sites fill up quickly.

    <p>The cardboard bank is further round the corner just before the gates to the Film Studio and I didn&#39;t know myself until the other day! The Council have confirmed that it is for residents only - I had been misinformed earlier!  However good has come from all this in that another cardboard bank is being provided very soon and the Council, so I have been assured, are hoping to get commercial recycling facilities up and running soon.  I think everyone should be encouraged to recycle, commercial or private.</p>
