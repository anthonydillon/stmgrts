    <p>What is interesting about this proposal is that the council&#39;s letter fails to mention that they will be also taking away 20 spaces. Most of the additional spaces to be created will only be available to the owners of driveways who presumably use their driveways to park anyway.</p>

    <p>Does anyone know when the Council is going to be re-surveying post the extension of the S Zone. I know many residents on the roads left out are now keen to join particularly as their roads now house all CPZ households 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> cars and many non-CPZ households have received tickets for parking in the CPZ/Yellow lines by not removing their cars on time.</p>  <p>The Council suggested they may bring the survey forward. The anti-CPZ campaign group that resisted the CPZ extension at the time, have made the lives of many hundreds, a parking misery.  Hopefully this time round they will be laughed and ridiculed and not given the time of day.</p>

    <p>I am not at all surprised about the situation that<br /> has arisen since implementation of the extension<br /> of zone S,<br /> The review is scheduled to take place 6 Month after implementation (about 3 month to go) and by that time the full impact will be known to residents of both camps.</p>  <p>The only certainty is that the review will not produce additional parking spaces nor will it reduce the number of vehicles residents can register to their home address because of the freedom/ rights we enjoy.</p>  <p>Returning to the Morley Road area - Parking Review<br /> there are conflicting statements regarding the designation of proposed bays across Crossovers in<br /> Michael Potter`s letter to residents.</p>  <ol> <li>...to allow resident/ occupiers of these properties and/or their visitors to park in front of the driveways on display of a valid parking permit.</li> <li>The review established that an approximate additional total of 66 spaces could be created in this area - all of which would be designated for any resident permit holder for zone F. Of this number, 56 would be located across existing driveways.</li> </ol>  <p>As for the 31 parking spaces removed by yellow lines I suppose the council and the consultants<br /> work under the premise that parking spaces follow the line of the kerb on bends and junctions and it is legal at present to park nose to tail around the bends and junctions.</p>
