    <p>Thanks for this update. Am I right in thinking that the re-phasing of the lights has already taken place? For the last three weeks there have been regular queues on the A316 from Richmond to St Margarets for no other apparent reason and far in excess of the usual queues here. These end abruptly at the St Margarets rbt suggesting that the phasing of these lights is the cause. The knock on from this seems to be people attempting to cut through Richmond leading to long delays throughout the area.</p>  <p>If this is the case, can the re-phasing of the lights be limited to the minimum time possible or at least be reduced to the minimum possible change in timings? I am sure that I am not alone in being hugely frustrated by these delays.....</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
