    <p>Your damn right it is a disgrace.   I live in North West Leeds and read this article via social media.  I have circulated it to all my friends, and also brought it to the attention of my local Member of Parliament too.  We keep the bad ones, and let the good ones go!</p>

    <p>Thought you might like to read the details from an email i have received via my local MP in NW Leeds.</p>  <p>Greg Mulholland MP</p>  <p>From the information that I have seen I certainly share your concern regarding the decision by the Home Office in relation to this, and I would echo the comments already made by my colleague Vince Cable.</p>  <p>Whilst the Home Office will not respond to me with any details of this case, I have still written to James Brokenshire, Immigration Minister, to raise both your concerns and my own. I will of course update you as soon as I receive a response.</p>
