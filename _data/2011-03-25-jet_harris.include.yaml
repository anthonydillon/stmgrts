    <p>I knew the group before Brian Bennet joined the Shadows and when Mr C Richards was deck lad from the ships.  Jet was a delight,charming and caring. God Bless</p>

    <p>Jet... Rest in peace mate. Like Elvis Presley, Eddie Cochran, Buddy Holly, I grew up with you. When you were in the Shadows you were great. I am positive that your singer front man whom I do not rate him at all... Cliff(Goody goody) Richard would never have made it to this day if it was not for you lads. He is still very much over rated compared to the likes of you and the original boys which includes Brian Bennett as well. God Bless you and keep rockin&#39; wherever you may be..  Sid.</p>

    <p>Hi It is with sadness in my heart that you "Jet" has left us, however you must be in good company with Tony(Meehan). I agree full with Sid&#39;s comments regarding "Harold Webb" the so called front man of the Shadows was and still very overrated to a high degree..the *** could not even invite our "Jet" on a show some time back featuring the originals.. Jet, I shed a tear over you and will never forget you. That is more than I can say for the Spanish bible bashing tax exile..  God Bless. Ann. xxx</p>

    <p>It was a sad day on March 18th 2011 and still is today. A great entertainer and performer. A true gent who always had a smile for the fans.</p>  <p>He should have at least had a part at the reunion if only the London show where it was filmed.</p>  <p>I also agree with Sid&#39;s comments, no time for that overrated Richards, (thanks Peter Stockton for his newspaper article showing everyone the person Richard is) The shadows with or without Jet sung far better, shame there wasnt more songs to add to the instrumental catalogue.</p>  <p>Always remembered Jet, especially everytime I plug my guitar in. Thanks for everything</p>
