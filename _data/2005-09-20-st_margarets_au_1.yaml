    <p>Fantastic! well done. Makes me realise I live in a village, not a metropolis. My son loved the carousels and I loved Zoran&#39;s chorizo &#39;burgers&#39;.</p>

    <p>Thank you so much to everyone who bought or donated at my Breakthrough Breast Cancer stall. I raised &pound;200 which went towards the &pound;1500 I raised for the charity. I completed the 60km walk last weekend and altogether everyone raised &pound;5.1 million for Breakthrough Breast Cancer!</p>
