    <p>THERE ARE ALREADY TWO NEW TRAVEL LODGES IN THE AREA, TWICKENHAM STATION AND TEDDINGTON. THEY ARE BOTH OUT OF KEEPING WITH LOCAL ARCHITECTURE AND ANOTHRE WOULD STICK OUT LIKE A SORE THUMB IN EAST TWICKENHAM. WE HAVE NO NEED FOR MORE SUPERMARKETS WHICH WILL ONLY SERVE TO JEOPARDISE THE SURVIVAL OF LOCAL SHOPS.</p>

    <p>I can&#39;t see any problem with a Travel Lodge or a Lidl supermarket on this site, at least it would bring much needed jobs to the area, what is there at the moment serves no purpose and is just an empty building block of no worth to the area, the last thing we want is more overpriced housing stock that local born and bred people could never dream of owning, also the strain on local schools would be intolerable if it was turned over to housing stock alone, let&#39;s get the right balance</p>  <p>I have lived in St Margarets for a good 50 years at a time when it was considered to be a very cheap alternative to Richmond, since then we have seen it rise to ridiculous heights as far as house prices go, so much that it is now named St Margarets Village, (where did that come from?) just to push the prices up even further I suppose, along with that it brings a few overpriced artisan type shops that us mere mortals on lower incomes/pensions can ill afford to shop at, bring on the Lidl&#39;s of this world to help us overstretched pensioners and families struggling on lower incomes, Yes, There are still people like us in the "Village" believe it or not, let&#39;s be fair to all, local overpriced shops for the well healed and cheapish shops for me and the like, both types of establishments would also serve and profit well from the introduction of the Travel Lodge.</p>  <p>Bring it on, I for one will vote in favour.</p>

    <p>I am writing to object in the strongest possible terms at the ideas being proposed. There are TWO other Travel Lodges in the immediate area and there are at least three other supermarkets within walking distance of the proposed site. There is a Tescos and a Sainsburys Local within five minutes walk. This residential area doesn&#39;t need additional supermarkets. I for one will be opposing and organising protests locally against any of these proposals for as long as it takes to see them off. The traffic this would create in the surrounding roads would be intolerable to an already busy stretch of road along St Margarets and East Twickenham. There is also already a Premiere Inn close to Richmond Station opening up in the near future which would serve the same purpose as the Travel Lodge and at much the same prices. I think we will get people who come into the area to drink and go to the popular bars and then be unable to drive home and use The Travel Lodge for the purpose of sleeping off their drunken evening.</p>

    <p>In favour- it will bring footfall to a sadly typically English dying street. Great idea re a supermarket- be it Lidl or Sainsbury- it will save having to walk over into Richmond for basics.</p>

    <p>For the residents of Ryde Place, the greatest concern is that heavy goods vehicles delivering to the Hotel and Supermarket will be using Ryde Place.  A private, unadopted road with 24 studio apartments  which will suffer intolerable traffic noise day and night as deliveries take place.</p>  <p>Deliveries to the new development, via Ryde Place will have a serious impact on residents sleep both morning and night. The road is already too narrow for cars to pass each other but large lorries, refuse collections, post vans, laundry and food suppliers will create a nightmare for us.</p>  <p>Coral Cooke Ryde Place march 2013</p>

    <p>I would be delighted to have a Lidl supermarket on my doorstep. The prices are good and their products are of a high quality, have a look in &#39;Which&#39;,as far as having a Travel Lodge, this is just what we need to give visiting friends and relatives a reasonably priced place to stay when us locals cannot accommodate them. Not everyone in LBRUT is on a high income, so don&#39;t forget us, we pay rates too.</p>

    <p>The application for a hotel was refused and then withdrawn. We wait to see what the owners come up with next.</p>
