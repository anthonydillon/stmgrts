    <p>Word is that "a third party" damaged a sewer and it flooded in to the river.</p>

    <p>Update Oct 22: " ... Between 26 September and 3 October we believe a low loader lorry delivered a 360 tracked excavator to open land at the Parkway junction with High Street, Cranford, TW5. The excavator was picked up on 2 or 3 October. While the excavator was on site, tipper lorries entered and deposited soils and other material, which was pushed up and shaped into a low embankment around the site by the excavator . . The weight of the vehicles, and possibly excavations carried out, appear to have fractured a sewage sludge main that runs beneath the site and the sludge escaped via the surface water drains to the river causing the pollution.</p>  <p>We are appealing for information that will help us identify any of the lorries or machinery used . . Both the waste and water pollution offences carried out here were criminal offences. You can report any information through our incident hot line on 0800 80 70 60 or through Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."</p>  <p><a href="http://cranevalley.org.uk/news/post/update-on-river-crane-pollution-incident/">cranevalley.org.uk/news/post/update-on-river-crane-pollution-incident</a></p>

    <p>A message from Rob Gray of FORCE, reposted from Twickerati:</p>  <p>&#39;One of our members is a local fisherman with many years experience of the River Crane. With the help of his fishing diaries we have pieced together a long term history of pollution events in the lower Crane and Duke of Northumberland&#39;s River (posted on our web-site <a href="http://www.force.org.uk/">www.force.org.uk/</a> under news and events - AGM). It makes for very depressing reading as it identifies 17 major pollution events - resulting in significant fish kills and/or extensive visible pollution -over the 27 year period from 1987 to date.</p>  <p>We consider that the long term abuse of this local environmental resource is no longer acceptable. We are proposing a public meeting in Twickenham in the New Year to debate, with the main interested parties, the current status of the river, along with how its robustness can be improved and vulnerability reduced. We shall provide more information when a date and venue for this meeting has been agreed.</p>  <p>Rob Gray Chair of FORCE&#39;</p>  <p><a href="https://twickerati.wordpress.com/2013/10/08/pollution-in-the-river-crane/comment-page-1/#comment-13652">twickerati.wordpress.com/2013/10/08/pollution-in-the-river-crane/comment-page-1/#comment-13652</a></p>
