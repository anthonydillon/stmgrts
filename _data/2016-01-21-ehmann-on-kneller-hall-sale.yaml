    <p>Since we are told that the sale of Kneller Hall is to fulfil a need for housing. Why doesn&#39;t the Conservative  government back up its promise not to build an extra runway at Heathrow and build houses on some of the land that has been bought for it.? Instead of destroying more of our local heritage. ..  It would still mean more congestion but perhaps for a more worthwhile reason.</p>

    <p>Hi, I&#39;ve signed this. I fear this wonderful building will go the way of so many others locally (Brunel, the Star&amp;Garter). But I think the petition organisers (LibDems) need to change the function of sharing it on social media. If you try and SHARE the survey on facebook it doesn&#39;t portray an image of Kneller Hall, but instead a LibDem motif. I think that will put people off sharing it.</p>
