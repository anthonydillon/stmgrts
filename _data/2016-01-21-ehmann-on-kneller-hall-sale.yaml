    <p>Sad to lose a beautiful building and a cultural music centre hosting super summer concerts.</p>

    <p>Since we are told that the sale of Kneller Hall is to fulfil a need for housing. Why doesn&#39;t the Conservative  government back up its promise not to build an extra runway at Heathrow and build houses on some of the land that has been bought for it.? Instead of destroying more of our local heritage. ..  It would still mean more congestion but perhaps for a more worthwhile reason.</p>

    <p>Hi, I&#39;ve signed this. I fear this wonderful building will go the way of so many others locally (Brunel, the Star&amp;Garter). But I think the petition organisers (LibDems) need to change the function of sharing it on social media. If you try and SHARE the survey on facebook it doesn&#39;t portray an image of Kneller Hall, but instead a LibDem motif. I think that will put people off sharing it.</p>

    <p>What is to happen to the Royal Military School of Music? This seems very short sighted for a national centre of excellence and a great pity for us locally.</p>

    <p>I am not local but am among thousands who would support a protest campaign to retain this military, musical and architectural heritage. Why don&#39;t you locals set one up on change.irg or some website like that?</p>

    <p>Yes, it is is very sad to hear of the demise of Kneller Hall but.....it does seem something of an anachronism that the RMSM still occupies the same premises as it did 150 years ago, when "Britain" was seriously awash in cash and national pride, both in short supply these days.  Like many other "iconic" buildings, it needs to be sold to pay for the mess left by the bankers....and if that isn&#39;t worth sacrificing our heritage for, what is?</p>

    <p>I&#39;m a Canadian Army graduate of the Student Bandmaster course at Kneller Hall. Since 1857 KH has been the home of the Royal Military School of Music, considered around the world as the centre for the finest band music on the planet. Originally the home of court painter Sir Godfrey Kneller, it is a double landmark of British heritage and tradition. Politicians who would sell it to be demolished have no respect for either, so next on the list might well be Buckingham Palace. Britain doesn&#39;t need politicians like this, so get rid of them.</p>
