    <p>Running to a tight schedule on Saturday so rocked up at 5 past 12; one tent (dairy etc.) was set up but no-one was selling and the meat and fish was only just being unpacked. Unfriendly looks and no approach made from those involved so I turned left, money firmly in pocket. Memo to organisers; if you say you&#39;ll be open for business at 12, make sure you are. And if you want to sell to people, make an effort to do so.</p>
