    <p>Thank you Martyn,</p>  <p>A typically entertaining and informative article, showing how deep and tangled are the historical roots of our neighbourhoods.  One thing intrinsic but unmentioned in all this was the importance of Whitton (or Birketts) Brook - a very minor tributary now and all but lost for the most part but then clearly an important marker worth fighting over - and in.</p>  <p>I am sure you are, but some of your readers may not be, aware of the recent booklet on the Whitton Brook, written by Ed Harris and published by BoTLHS <a href="http://botlhs.co.uk/portfolio-tags/publications/">botlhs.co.uk/portfolio-tags/publications</a></p>  <p>Regards,</p>  <p>Rob Gray</p>
