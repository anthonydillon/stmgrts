    <p>I, for one, think this site is great and the St Margarets Journal seems to be identical to every other site that Online Communities publishes.  Their information is good, but really Richmond Borough-wide while this site is really about very local issues and events.</p>  <p>I will use both sites.  Keep up the good work!</p>

    <p>I agree, I enjoy this site because it&#39;s just St.Margarets, it&#39;s easy to use and has pages and pages of local information. I feel that this site is the one for local residents but will check the onlinecom version from time to time.</p>
