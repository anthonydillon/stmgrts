    <p>A really interesting article on the 1948 Games and layout of the camp in Richmond Park.  I live in Napoleon Road and am now flat out working on the 2012 Games showing visitors around the Olympic Park Area.  My fellow Blue Badge Tourist Guide colleagues and I conduct daily walking tours leaving Bromley-by-Bow tube station at 11.00.  Details on <a href="http://www.toursof2012sites.com">www.toursof2012sites.com.</a>. Don&#39;t miss your chance to see developments on the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.  The Velodrome will be complete early next year!</p>

    <p>I really enjoyed the article about the 1948 olympics. At that time I lived at Dover and waited to see the Olympic Torch arrive there having crossed the channel I suppose on one of the ferries. I actually touched it but I can&#39;t remember whether this was before or after it was handed over!I think it was the flame that was handed over being used to light another torch. The torches were rather tinny creations I think but most things were in those days. I am now 75 so you can work out if interested how old I was when the torch came.</p>
