    <p>The scheme as it stands will mean a loss of about 30 car parking spaces. Whilst children&#39;s safety should in no way be compromised your local councillors are in discussions with officers to see if a happy medium can be reached where loss of parking is minimised whilst achieving the necessary safety levels for vehicles and children. We would welcome any input from residents.</p>  <p>Cllr Ben Khosa</p>

    <p>Seems to me that 90% of the problem are parents who are no longer walking their children to school, or using the excellent &#39;walking buses&#39;.</p>  <p>Why don&#39;t the parents make a commitment to stop driving and start walking again!</p>

    <p>I can understand the need for safety of the children, but the area desperately needs those parking spaces.</p>  <p>The parking restrictions should just apply during the day, and not at night so that people coming home from work could use it after school is over. Evening is when the parking problems are really bad.</p>

    <p>Notwithstanding children&#39;s safety, it would be disastrous to lose parking spaces - why can&#39;t parents start walking their children to school?</p>  <p>If the worst happens and this goes ahead, it should only be for term time and school times only!</p>

    <p>I agree with both Sue &amp; Virginia, it would be a complete disaster if restriction applied out of school hours and term times, as we all know so well how valuble just 30 parking spaces are in this area.</p>  <p>Can&#39;t the school encourage more use of the excellent "Walking Bus" by sending children home with leaflets asking parents not to use cars for the school run.</p>  <p>Do parents acually care about the climate or their childrens health/future, or is it just sheer lazyness, I know of someone that uses a car from the Richmond Road and goes back home straight away, can anyone beat that !!!!</p>

    <p>Spare a tought for parents who are NOT fortunate enough to stay at home! My wife and I have to work and don&#39;t have much option of flex-time, not to mention we need to use a car to get there. My wife drops my daughter off at school on the way to work and does not have much of an option, as do many other working families.</p>

    <p>please can someone advise me as there seems ti be some confusion as to the yellow zig zag line outside schools. by the school i patrol the lines have been extended. IS IT or the car number reportable to the police for action to be taken, as some think that it is not an offence to park on these lines</p>
