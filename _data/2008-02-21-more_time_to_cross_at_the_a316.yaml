    <p>I suggest that residents should make sure that Geoff Pope, a Lib Dem London Assembly member and Twickenham resident, is well aware of their concerns on this issue; he is a former Chair [now Vice Chair as the posts rotate] of the Assembly&#39;s Transport Committee and is the Party&#39;s Spokesperson on Transport. The whole Assembly is up for election May so he should be receptive.</p>  <p>My guess is that what is needed is a policy change at TfL to force them to give more time to controlled pedestrian crossings: if so, this must come from the Mayor, who needs to be goaded into it by the Assembly. You can contact Geoff via: <a href="http://www.gla.libdems.org.uk/pages/Pope.html">www.gla.libdems.org.uk/pages/Pope.html</a></p>

    <p>Good work Kate and Hilary! Why will it take 2-3 months? Is this not urgent?</p>
