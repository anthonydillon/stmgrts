    <p>Thank you for taking the time to report this. Please may I correct your figures. When asked to explain the disproportionatley high figure of &pound;450,000 for architects&#39; fees for St Stephen&#39;s, a key Council member said this was an error and the figure is, in fact, &pound;95,000. There is a further &pound;228,000 allocated for fees for a quantity surveyor, building services and structural engineer. These are to be split between St Stephen&#39;s and Orleans Infants. St Stephen&#39;s will incur a VAT bill of approximately &pound;350,000 which is non-reclaimable due to its status as a voluntary-aided Church School.</p>  <p>Using the figure of &pound;95,000, the amount for building costs; furniture, fittings and equipment and school decant (movement between buildings) is &pound;2,826,000 for Orleans Infants and &pound;1,441,000 for St Stephen&#39;s.</p>  <p>The amount for Orleans Infants will enable the school to adapt its site appropriately. The amount for St Stephen&#39;s will severely limit what can be achieved, not least because the build costs per square metre will be greater due to the existing Victorian buildings and the site restrictions.</p>  <p>Orleans Infants can afford to build a completely new Junior block. St Stephen&#39;s will have to convert existing classrooms to accommodate the space requirements for Infants as well as adding buildings to a restricted site. St Stephen&#39;s is one of the most restricted school sites in the Borough, if not the most restricted, according to another key Council member.</p>  <p>There are many parents in St Margarets who are concerned about the funding levels for St Stephen&#39;s. The need to provide additional Reception class places is understood but the St Margarets community deserves to have Two Good Schools, not one which is fit for purpose and one Cinderella school compromised by inadequate funding.</p>  <p>Helen Henderson</p>

    <p>PS. The figure of &pound;450,000 for architects&#39;s fees is in the Primary Schools Expansion Consultancy Contracts, 6 July 09 which is the one I queried. This figure is incorrect. The Cabinet Member Report St Stephen&#39;s Junior School Expansion document, 3.3, shows &pound;95,000 for all RIBA work stages.</p>  <p>St Stephen&#39;s build costs are shown as &pound;1,200,000 with the balance for VAT, legal fees, in-house costs, planning and building control costs, site investigation and survey, ICT, decanting and moving costs and 5% contingency. My figure of &pound;1,441,000 is therefore an over-estimate which is not good news as we need every penny we can get.</p>  <p>Helen Henderson</p>

    <p>I thank HH for her correction and explanation; I noticed that the budget for the architect seemed very high but did not check it.</p>
