    <p>Hallo from snowy! Christchurch, New Zealand - I was born in Sydney Road, St. M&#39;s- often taken to Moor Mead for an outing in my pram,  then with our Sealyham, then to the swings, etc.  Cherished memories of all the area, with my Grandparents living in Napoleon Road and Aunt &amp; Uncle in The Avenue.     Hope you all have a wonderful  day and  the sun shines for you all.   Best wishes, Patricia Hammond</p>

    <p>What a triumph! The weather held up until practically the end. After years of moaning about the loo facilities you have finally cracked it! They were great, no queueing and reasonably clean. A fantastic day all round.</p>
