    <p>Last week&#39;s letter on this topic in the RTT from Cllr Malcolm Elloy, Lib Dem education spokesperson, is at:</p>  <p><a href="http://twickenhamlibdems.co.uk/en/article/2012/567790/elloy-plans-will-destabilise-colleges">twickenhamlibdems.co.uk/en/article/2012/567790/elloy-plans-will-destabilise-colleges</a></p>  <p>&#39; . . The two main providers are Richmond College and Esher College. Richmond College is one of the top providers in the coun&amp;Acirc;&shy;try for the highly academic international baccalaureate . . while Esher is an outstanding college with impressive A-level results. This tertiary system provides a very good bridge between school and higher education . . This plan could destabilise our colleges. They currently provide a very wide range of courses and at all levels, much more than could be provided by individual small sixth forms.</p>  <p>We, therefore, have a Conser&amp;Acirc;&shy;vative administration that is planning to spend in excess of &pound;25m on a project which will probably not improve outcomes; and is likely to lead to a much re&amp;Acirc;&shy;duced offer on courses. This is reckless and irresponsible whatever the financial climate. If we already had sixth forms in our schools, would the council propose, in the name of competition, setting up at huge expense a rival tertiary college system? - of course not . . &#39;</p>
