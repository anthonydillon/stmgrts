    <p>I&#39;ve just had the same thing happen to me. Two calls one from John giving me a 6 figure number and asking the same questions, the second from a Micheal going over the questions and saying l&#39;ll receive another call tomorrow telling me how much l&#39;ll get, he also asked if l had l.d. as l would need this for the cheque and what l.d. l&#39;d be using. I thought this has to be a scam, and found your message. Thanks. I didn&#39;t catch the 1<sup>st</sup> number, but the 2<sup>nd</sup> was 01384410370.</p>

    <p>I have had exactly the same this week everyday for the last 4 days. On every call I have told them I&#39;m not interested and put the phone down but still they try again. They don&#39;t appear to take the rather unsubtle hint.</p>

    <p>Morning just had a phone call from mark benson stating that I have 3;000 pounds from the Bank of England and all I had to do was to claim my 3;000 pounds was to buy an Argos steam card for 150 pounds . Is this a scam ?</p>
