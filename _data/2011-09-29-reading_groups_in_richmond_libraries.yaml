    <p>Some of you may have read about my novel&#39; The White Rajah&#39; in the St Margarets Magazine.</p>  <p>The local History Reading Group are interested in discussing the book but they try to stick to books that are available in local libraries. Richmond&#39;s libraries don&#39;t stock &#39;The White Rajah&#39; (unless you count the copy I gave them today).</p>  <p>It would be really helpful if they did. Could you request that they do so, using the online form at <a href="https://richmond.firmstep.com/default.aspx/RenderForm/?HideToolbar=1&amp;F.Name=j8h4miz6wku">richmond.firmstep.com/default.aspx/RenderForm/?HideToolbar=1&amp;F.Name=j8h4miz6wku</a> or by getting a Stock Request form from the library? It doesn&#39;t cost anything and it would be appreciated.</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
