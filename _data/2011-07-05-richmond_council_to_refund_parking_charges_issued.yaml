    <p>This is unsatisfactory. At our meeting with The Council yesterday it was stated that Richmond intend to waste tax payers money by advertising.</p>  <p>Richmond intend to do this so that they can contact people who are due refunds. A simple letter to those people who have paid any of these unlawful penalties would suffice.<br /> Nigel Wise.</p>

    <p>Frankly, while acknowledging that Councils should be competent enough to ensure their operations are carried out corectly in all aspects and thus the technical rectitude of the refund ofer, some of us will think it "unsatisfactory" that boorish, self-centred, illegal car-parkers are potentially whipping a million pounds out of essential Council services on a technicality.</p>  <p>A for the &#39;little&#39; man in every sense.</p>
