    <p>Well Mr Houston, probably because their primary function is to raise funds for LBRUT.  They are not bothered about the technicalities of the situation and probably recruited specifically for their lack of concern for the driver.</p>  <p>What really bugs me however is their total lack of concern for parking as a safety hazard.  They zip around at 8.15am, on their bikes, "catching" residents who have parked up to the corner overnight in quiet side roads, but ignore those who are doing it at the top of Broadway Avenue and Amyand Park Road just so they can nip into Tesco.  That situation will be exacerbated when the new coffee shop opens in the old Superdrug store.</p>
