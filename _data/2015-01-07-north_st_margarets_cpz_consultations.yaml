    <p>What does anyone think of changing the whole of S zone to a 2 hour CPZ?<br /> The cost of permits is less and less inconvenience for your visitors and tradesmen while still a deterrent to commuters.</p>

    <p>Not a good idea, with a growing workforce being able to choose their working hours they could work round a 2 hour slot before leaving for work, parking anywhere in zone S to catch a train, we would then be back to the bad old days when parking in your street becomes a nightmare once more.</p>  <p>I can&#39;t see the cost of permits being any less, as they still have to issue them, only the time on them would change.</p>  <p>My visitors work round the times without any problems, and judging by the amount of builders/tradespersons who are parked up every day round this area it doesn&#39;t seem to cause them a problem, they only stick the cost of any permits on to their final bill.</p>  <p>I would like to see this idea left well alone.</p>

    <p>What has zone S to do with the current consultation?<br /> I hope residents of North St Margarets will focus on their area without letting their attention being diverted.<br /> Residents in North St Margarets may however benefit by the many messages that can be found in the archives of this site during April 2009 prior to that cpz being established.</p>

    <p>Forgive me if I have hi-jacked the thread.  I thought it an opportunity to see if the idea had any traction.<br /> In response to Alsie; Before the CPZ there were 100 more parking spaces available during the day than there were at night (according to the beat figs).  I doubt a 2hr CPZ would make any difference in number of commuters.</p>  <p>A 2hr permit costs &pound;40 as opposed to the &pound;68 now and you would need to purchase fewer visitor permits.<br /> The 2hr CPZs in Barnes, East Sheen and Kew seem to work well from the reports I have received but I quite understand that many people are fearful of a change to the status quo.</p>
