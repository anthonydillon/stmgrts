    <p>Starter for ten... The new CPZ has made parking on current non-CPZ roads (I&#39;m on South Western Rd) pretty difficult during weekday business hours - lots of builders vans and day commuters I suspect. That said, if we take CPZ into wider use, it doesn&#39;t help us in the evenings when most of us car users come home. Will the extra couple of hundred quid we will pay Richmond (sorry we are 2 car users that work outside M25, public transport options limited) simply fill the council coffers, or offer a real solution?</p>

    <p>Great. I have been waiting for this day for some time. Ok, it&#39;s &pound;75 a year and an hour of my life in the Parking "Shop". Our lovely roads will look like a car park with white lines and we&#39;ll have to have some more of those repulsive signs. And ok, maybe there will be a lot less spaces to actually park meaning we will have more trouble parking at busy times at the weekends and in the evenings...But hey from 9.30am to 4:30pm, when no one is around, I will have 40 free parking spaces on my road from the current 30 free so I will be able to park a fleet of cars and maybe even an HGV which will of course be able to manoeuvre its way much more easily once we go to CPZ (so I am told...)</p>  <p>We all know CPZ is coming. But let&#39;s not pretend that this has anything to do with traffic control, highway safety, preventing commuter parking, or encouraging low CO2 emissions and accept that it has everything to do with generating revenue for Richmond Council</p>

    <p>Please don&#39;t let this happen!  The parking problem is at night - often Sunday nights.  CPZ, &pound;75 and the bureaucratic hell of "The Parking Shop" won&#39;t solve that.  When I work from home during the weekday I never have a problem parking in my street (Sidney Road).  I don&#39;t care if the occasional shopper parks here - at least they&#39;re supporting our community.  The CPZ causes more problems and solves none.</p>

    <p>While I am also against a CPZ, I do hope that the council takes the makes a tough grownup decision for once and either does the whole rest of the area or none of it. It would be ridiculous to have one or two roads left without a CPZ. You will never please everyone.</p>

    <p>I do agree that it is absurd that the CPZ hours across the borough (except in Central Richmond) end at 4:30. I used to live in Zone F by Richmond Bridge and ,as the nearest uncontrolled roads to Richmond, our streets were used as a free carpark at evenings and weekends by those shopping or partying in Richmond.</p>

    <p>I think the fear of CPZ in people&#39;s minds seems to obliterate the possible benefits.   I live in Winchester Road and CPZ has transformed my life.  The environment is now pleasant without being crammed with cars by day and I can come and go knowing I can park easily.    It has also had a knock on effect in the evening, as it has not been so difficult to park (no vans, commuter and long-stay cars parked). Nothing in this world is perfect and in this instance, we have to pay for the privilege of parking, but it is one I am very happy to shell out for.</p>

    <p>We do need a decision one way or the other,all or nothing What we have at the moment outside the CPZ are commuters from outside the area,visitors(fair enough ) people from CPZ areas who have not taken the permits, long stay free parking of vans and caravettes using the free parking With CPZ it eliminates the miscellaneous parkers above during the day, it does not change the evening parking but it will improve because those vehicles who use the free parking from outside their zones are parking for days and nights The cost of the parking permits is minimal compared to the parking damage to my vehicle due to the bumper to bumper parking</p>

    <p>We live in The Grove Flats on St Margarets road (but the back of the property is on Winchester Rd), the CPZ has been a nightmare for us as we have 60 flats at The Grove and only capacity for about 20 cars on The Grove&#39;s private land, which we are not even meant to use for parking. We have also not been allowed to buy parking permits as the council deem our property to be on St Margarets Rd and have not taken into account that we are also on Winchester Rd. In regard to Sue&#39;s post, dated 20th March, the reason she is able to park in Winchester Rd at the moment is because Grove residents are not allowed permits at present but if this changes Sue will then again find parking as difficult as it was before CPZ was introduced. I think the CPZ should be removed all together.</p>

    <p>60 Flats at The Grove, 20 off street parking spaces? How many vehicles are generated by the occupants of The Grove? Where are the vehicles in excess of 20 parked?</p>  <p>I have noticed a marked increase of vehicles parked on streets north of the A316 during the past 6 Month.</p>

    <p>Isn&#39;t the real issue just the price of the permit?  If the council implemented a CPZ and gave a free permit to each household wouldn&#39;t we all embrace the improvement in parking conditions?  It wouldn&#39;t guarantee a space, but it would eradicate long term non-resident parking which would be a marked improvement.</p>  <p>I notice the Conservatives have leafleted the area with a pledge that should they win the next council election "They will scrap the CPZ Tax."  So vote yes for a CPZ and yes to the Tories and we should all be able to park for free.  (Though I may just be willfully missing the point.)</p>

    <p>I really do object to paying for what we currently receive. There will be no advantage in paying the council. Parking during the day will still be possible and parking at night will continue to be a problem.It will also be more expensive to use tradespeople as their costs for working in CPZ zones will be passed to the customers.Friends will visit less frequently. I cannot believe that people are prepared to pay for this inconvenience. Richmond Council must be laughing at residents&#39; naivety-it achieves the targets to reduce traffic and we choose to pay for it and the penalty fines that will follow.

    <p>I live on Bridge Road. The CPZ has had an amazing positive impact. I can now find parking outside my house during the day and it is much easier at night too.</p>

    <p>Ran out of popcorn reading (and contributing to) this and other threads on CPZ; but have now been to the foyer and bought some chocolates! Thanks for asking! Bit sad, though, that parking seems to be the only thing that makes people contribute to the Forum...</p>

    <p>I think that the most important issue is being ignored. I live on Godstone Road and it is always packed full of cars. However, it is difficult to make an informed decision without knowing the numbers.</p>  <p>How many car parking spaces are there on the roads affected? (This will have to be estimated) How many spaces will be lost due to the new yellow lines if a CPZ goes ahead. When is parking a problem? Like Saturdays when parents congregate around Moor Mead park taking their kids to football or tennis. Most importantly, how many residents have cars?</p>  <p>If every second property in Godstone Road owns one car then the street would probably be full. What benefit is the CPZ then?</p>  <p>How can we make a decision without knowing what the actual impact is?</p>
