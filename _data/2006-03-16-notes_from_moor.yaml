    <p>I have been reading all the comments on all of the items on the site and it strikes me that the best use of the park would be to turn it into a multi-story car park.<br /> That way, we could have our soft play space since there would now be parking for all the "evil 4&#215;4s", people could have room to park around Tescos (since the residents&#39; cars would now be in the car park), we could have our wine bar, and all the residents could stop moaning about the lack of parking spaces. Sound like a winner on all sides.</p>  <p>In the interest of keeping some green space, we would just make the top floor a roof garden - maybe even keeping the original grass.</p>  <p>Maybe I&#39;ll put in an official proposal at the next meeting...</p>
