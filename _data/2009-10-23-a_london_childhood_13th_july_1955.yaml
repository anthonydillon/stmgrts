    <p>I read Martyn Day&#39;s interpretation of the Ruth Ellis story and his anecdotal schoolboy stories.</p>  <p>I quote from his story:</p>  <p>"Some of the boys....had seen Ruth Ellis leaving the prison every morning for the Old Bailey."</p>  <p>Ruth Ellis&#39;s trial lasted just over a day, so she actually went to the Old Bailey twice during the trial.</p>  <p>It is now known, from files recently released at The National Archives in Kew that Ruth Ellis did not have a miscarriage - she admitted to the Holloway prison hospital doctor that she had in fact just had an abortion.</p>  <p>Monica Weller</p>
