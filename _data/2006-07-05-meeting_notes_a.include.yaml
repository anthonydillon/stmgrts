    <p>Sorry is there a parking problem in St Margarets?  Not according to a Planning Report in relation to a recently passed application for a Wine Bar (under the Phelps block of buildings) with a potential capacity of 140 people. The Council&#39;s Transport Officers say "there is capacity for on-street parking".  But at least it&#39;s good to know that they would not like to see coach parties using the premises.........</p>
