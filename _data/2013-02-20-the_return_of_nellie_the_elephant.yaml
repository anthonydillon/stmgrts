    <p>Hi,</p>  <p>I wonder if you could help? I&#39;ve now lost three parcels sent via the St Margarets Post Office. I sent them recorded delivery but they never arrived. The last time the lady there told me she had given me two receipts but I know she only gave me one. It happened the time before but I thought it was I must have lost it. The second receipt has the tracking number on it</p>  <p>I wondered if anyone else had had similar problems with this post office</p>  <p>Thanks Michelle</p>
