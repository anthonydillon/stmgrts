    <p>Would be good to see just why the Committee approved it, I&#39;m absolutely shocked that they did and was expecting it to go all the way through the process.</p>  <p>The SPD is a farce, along with the commitment to a Catholic school it&#39;s a horrid, short term and populist scheme on the part of Tory councillors. Planning regulations are quite strict enough in this, the least built up Borough in London, without further restricting.</p>  <p>That said if it was enacted it should have been followed.</p>  <p>It will be very interesting to understand the full rationale behind the decision.</p>
