    <p>reminds me of the time at Richmond Staton when a group of pensioners wanted to catch a train due to leave at 9.31 am and pleaded to be allowed through in time to get to the platform.  they were allowed through when it was realized they could not sprint for the train!</p>

    <p>This works both ways.  I get up at 5am so that I can take advantage of the other end of the off-peak fare schedule.  Not happy at having to wake up so early every day, I&#39;m thankful that I can touch in as late as 6.29!</p>
