    <p>After reading this article, your readers may be interested to know that Richmond Council is currently consulting residents on the Local Flood Risk Management Strategy for the borough.</p>  <p>The survey can be found online, here: <a href="https://consultation.richmond.gov.uk/">consultation.richmond.gov.uk</a></p>  <p>I hope any damage caused in the recent high waters was limited to things that are easily replaced.</p>
