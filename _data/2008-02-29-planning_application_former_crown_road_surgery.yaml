    <p>The applicant is now no longer seeking to annex parking spaces on Napoleon Road.(Agents letter posted on the 5<sup>th</sup> March)</p>  <p>This levels the playing field; conditions can be put in place that prevents some of the units in the property being allowed to purchase parking permits.</p>  <p>These conditions can only be applied in a CPZ and therefor are only effective during the Hours of control and will not have any effect on numbers of cars registered to each unit and consequently the pressure on parking will increase.</p>  <p>I have noted that residents only react to planning applications on their "door step" and ignore development a little further a field.</p>  <p>Over development in St Margarets and elsewhere in the Borough results in more pressure on parking and resulting in extra CO2 emissions.</p>  <p>The council need to be given the proof how residents feel about the issue before the council can even consider changing its policies.</p>  <p>I have also noted a certain amount of planning fatige when initial planning applications are withdrawn at the eleven`s hour because objections by local residents.</p>  <p>Some weeks later the application is re presented whith minor adjustment; previous objectors are sometimes to tired to re visite the planning department or the web site, studying revised plans and then making their comments. Example: 115 St Margarets Road (rear of Koblers Bakery).</p>  <p>While some of the objections to the original proposal have been addressed by the new proposal the the prime objection, (the loss of valuable retail space) is still part of the new proposal.</p>  <p>I am concerned that to date no comments at all have been made according to the web site even though now an extra storey has been added.</p>  <p>Another concern of mine is that the application fee is returned to the applicant if the application is withdrawn; surely, the fees are to cover the cost of the man hours put in by the planning department.</p>

    <p>Apropos Gerhard&#39;s remark about former Kobler&#39;s at 115 St Margarets Road, I see that L&#39;Amandine have just had their new shopfront approved by Planning, so I guess they really are on their way.</p>
