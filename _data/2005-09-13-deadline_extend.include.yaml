    <p>have wriiten to the council objecting to the extension of the pubs opening hours. I live close to the pub and don&#39;t need to be woken up by the pub at 2 in the morning as they kick out people. the live music is too much especially on a summers evening when the doors are wide open</p>

    <p>Am not all that happy with the proposed extension as the pub is pretty noisy at closing time as it is, don&#39;t really see why a pub such as the St. Margarets needs to stay open till 2am? Seeing as the area is really residential and the pub is surrounded by homes does the management of the pub not care about how much noise and trouble this will cause?</p>  <p>St Margarets is a nice place to live and cannot see how residents can just sit back and watch the area become more of a late night venue??</p>  <p>I for one shall be raising an objection and suggest others that feel the same do so as well.</p>

    <p>I think we should take into account that the St Margarets Tavern has become involved in the local community. They did sponser the All Beats band on Saturday and have taken over running the very successfull beer tent at the St Margarets Fair. Yes things are changing in St Margarets but also in the outside world, we can&#39;t necessarily stop those changes but if we can try to influence them. We need to work together to create the kind of environment we want to live in. We should supportr the local businesses and in turn ask them to be considerate of our &#39;village&#39;.</p>

    <p>the pub supporting worthy events has no relevance to the extended opening hours which will undo any good work and efforts that it seeks to achieve. i support the pub as well, i drink the beer and just do not want to be unduly disturbed by people at 2am as thats not fair on me or the others that live close by.</p>

    <p>James have you asked the pub if they can close the doors in the evening? It sounds like something that neighbours could resolve amicably- that is if you have told them about the problem.</p>

    <p>I&#39;m with James on this.  I understand the point being made about the pub (and the landlord) playing an important part in the local community.  Also, I drink at the St Margarets Tavern.  However, I will be objecting to the proposed extended opening hours.  It&#39;s nothing to do with not supporting the pub as a local business, rather that I live near the pub and I need to get some sleep!  The noise generated from the pub really can be intrusive to those that live locally.  I have to get up for work at 6.15am in the morning - not getting to sleep until the early hours every night is really not an exciting prospect!  And yes we can ask local business to be &#39;considerate&#39; but how will it work in practice?  In the past we&#39;ve had to complain about the pub dumping all their used bottles into a recycling bin at about 11.30pm - midnight every evening (very loud).  My husband contacted the pub on three separate occasions to politely ask if this could perhaps not be done last thing at night - it got us nowhere.  In the end we had to complain to the council, at which point it stopped.  And even if the pub becomes more &#39;considerate&#39; to local residents, there&#39;s not a lot they can do about noisy customers who like to stand around and shout their goodbyes to each other at 2 in the morning.</p>

    <p>seems there is a fair amount of community objection to the pubs extension proposal. i have recieved two leaflets through my door encouraging those that feel they will be adversly affected by longer opening hours to make their views known.</p>  <p>fair play to them for doing that.</p>
