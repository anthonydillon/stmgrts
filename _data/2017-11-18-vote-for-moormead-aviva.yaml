    <p>This project has been under discussion for some time. What no-one ever seems to be able to tell me, is who will service these toilets when they have been constructed, and who will make sure that they are open to the public from when the early morning runners arrive, to when the last straggler leaves the playground? If there is no plan in place for this, and no guaranteed opening hours, then the provision will benefit only sports clubs, such as Moor Mead F.C, who will be the regular users of the pavilion, rather than the wider public. Allowing children to vote also seems odd to me, since it inevitably skews the competition in favour of projects providing facilities for children. Aren&#226;&#128;&#153;t there any RULES to this thing???</p>

    <p>This does seem to come round with an unsatisfactory regularity. It must be 3 years since I contributed to a previous campaign and 17 years since El Brute said they would only consider an early years setting on a "set up, put away" daily basis. &#194;&pound;25k doesn&#39;t seem much unless there is some committed volunteering - not guaranteed as the children grow up and parents attention moves on.</p>
