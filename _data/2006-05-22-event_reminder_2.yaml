    <p>Sorry to mention this again - but this is really frustrating....1-3pm on a weekday afternoon is very difficult for many of us. I&#39;m sure there are others like myself who would like the opportunity to speak directly to Alan and one of the new councillors together, rather than just posting a question for them on this website.  If the turnout is small I hope they don&#39;t take this as a lack of interest, it certainly isn&#39;t in my road.</p>

    <p>I think that this was something already arranged rather then being a response to the previous posts. PS 3 TW MALIK has posted on the site to say you can contact him on<br />  <a href="mailto:StMargarets.NorthTwickenham.snt@met.police.uk">StMargarets.NorthTwickenham.snt@met.police.uk</a><br /> I will try and get there tomorrow and ask if we can arrange an evening/ weekend meeting at least once. I think it is still worth while to have the opportunity to post on the site not least because the police and the councillors do seem to be reading it and this discussion is a lot more than we have had previously even if it is not perfect.</p>

    <p>I am sure at least one of us 3 councilors will be able to attend any alternative times or venues.</p>  <p>Ben Khosa</p>

    <p>I am just back from Zorans and can report that I spoke to PC Richens and a community Support officer. PS Malik called in to say that "the police team are complely behind this community involvement and their interest and enthusiasm will continue at the same level because they are committed to this area". Also in there were our three newly elected councilors, Philip Morgan, Ben Khosa and Geoff Acton. I asked if it would be possible to have an evening or weekend meeting and it was agreed that the police and the councillors would come to the local St Margarets Development meeting already arranged for Tuesday 6<sup>th</sup> June between 7.30 and 9pm in the Winchester Hall.<br /> I asked PC Richens about the false front on the Tesco cash machine and he has promised to bring more information about this sort of crime and what to look for on the 6<sup>th</sup> of June. In the meantime he said that they would keeping an eye on the area.<br /> PC Richens said that he had found the poll on the website very helpful and they would take the comments in to account when patroling the area. He is going to look into the possibility of writing a regular police update for the website.<br /> At this point being neither retired nor available to lunch I had to leave. I hope this helps for those of you who could not get there at all.</p>
