    <p>Most interesting but ,surely, Headlam&#39;s d.o.d. is 18th November 1924.</p>

    <p>I was fascinated to find this. Stewart Headlam was the uncle and guardian of my grandmother. He once gave my godmother, his great niece,  2/6 for learning a psalm by heart. My mother was extremely proud of his deeds . He started a family tradition of service to children in Inner London schools that is still perpetuated today. My Great Aunt Marie&#39;s husband Frederick Bettany wrote a biography of SDH published in 1926. I have dedicated the hymnbooks in our church to his memory.</p>
