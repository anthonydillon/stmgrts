    <p>The reason for moving the farmers&#39; market is to free up the car parking space which it occupies so that more shoppers can come by car to do their weekly shop in the town centre, which is what residents wish to do.</p>  <p>Or so I am told - I don&#39;t use the market myself as I live in East Twickenham and shop in Richmond.</p>

    <p>I&#39;ve got to admit that putting a market in an area subject to tidal flooding does seem a bit...stupid? I&#39;m more interested in duck eggs than ducks.</p>  <p>Other alternatives - on Twickenham Green, numerous schools, the old sorting office (temporarily), Station Rd car park, maybe even Orleans School or another school nearby?</p>  <p>Personally, I rarely shop there as I hate driving in to Twickenham.</p>

    <p>There&#39;s a fairly high tide due on Sunday 3<sup>rd</sup> July around 5:30pm (4.9m at Richmond lock 16:17GMT) so if you pop down around then will be able to ascertain where it actually floods and how bad it might be.</p>  <p>Tides higher than that are less common  but it will reach 5.2m on Wednesday 3<sup>rd</sup> August 6:30pm and 5.4m Wednesday 31st August 5:21pm.  Times at Twickenham Riverside will be somewhat later.</p>  <p>Source: <a href="http://www.pla.co.uk/display_fixedpage.cfm?id=11&amp;site=maritime">www.pla.co.uk/display_fixedpage.cfm?id=11&amp;site=maritime</a></p>
