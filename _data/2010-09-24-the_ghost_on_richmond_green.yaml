    <p>I love ghosts. Personnely I am one myself, but these pictures are absolutely rubbish. I am coming up to my 200th Birthday and want to celebrate it in fashion. So would your photographers come to my birthday on the 11th february at midnight? It would make my birthday very special!! I could show all my friends the wonderful pictures and I could also show my great great great great great great grandchildren who are now 11. I will creep into their room and stuff the pictures under the pillows so they wake up and see me and have a massive shock. I know I am going off the plot now, but I thought you might want to know my family names. Mum-Janettttttta Dad-pauuuuuuuul. Thats how we pronounce them because we are.....GHOSTS!!!!</p>
