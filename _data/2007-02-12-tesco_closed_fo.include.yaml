    <p>I&#39;m delighted that Broadway Stores has survived the Tesco onslaught. I thought it would be the first to go under, but it seems better stocked than ever. More power to its elbow.</p>  <p>And Carlos at Streets the greengrocer tells me that his business is better than ever.</p>

    <p>I agree I think we are lucky to have such a good range of local shops so it probably is use them or lose them.</p>

    <p>Hurrah. Now perhaps St Margarets will remember that there are REAL newsagents, at the station and at Nike News.</p>

    <p>Maybe if Broadway Stores served fresh, healthy food rather than the usual stale sandwiches, melted chocolate bars and rancid milk, it wouldn&#39;t need a community campaign to save it. The reason why these &#39;high street&#39; shops are going out of business is because they can&#39;t hack the quality and prices offered by the larger chains. Groceries sales is a dog-eat-dog business and if they can&#39;t keep up, they get eaten. That&#39;s capitalism and you all voted for it. Deal with it.</p>

    <p>We miss Tescos. Sob, sob.  I do try the Broadway place when I can but it&#39;s pretty poor produce and let&#39;s face it - it is really, just a glorified off license.</p>  <p>I hope Tescos comes back and dumps its range of booze, newspapers and chemist stuff. We can get that next door. Hopefully, they will just focus on the core principles and increase the range of food they sell.</p>  <p>Victor Meldrew</p>

    <p>Hurry back Tesco&#39;s, as Mac says, it&#39;s the best thing thats happened in St Margarets for ages.</p>  <p>No more silly inflated "Village" prices, just good all round value for money, ideal for families and pensioners alike.</p>  <p>I must also say that all the staff have always been very polite and friendly ever since they opened.</p>  <p>Keep up the good work Tesco&#39;s</p>

    <p>Tesco is relatively clean, open at considerate hours, cheap, relatively spacious in comparison to the &#39;local&#39; shops and has a far greater range than any of the &#39;newsagents&#39;. Both Broadway news and Nike News need a ruddy good clean - the shop fittings and some of the confectionary goods have been there since the early 1980s. The call for &#39;saving the high street&#39; is grossly hypocritical considering how much the shops and their function have changed over the past 50 years - why now is their suddenly a problem?</p>

    <p>I think, people are being a little harsh on Tesco.  People have short memories and I can remember Olivers which was overpriced, the fresh food, if you could call it that was not very nice.  Although we should all support our local shops and businesses at the same time the simple convenience which Tesco offers especially after getting off the train after a long day at work means people will always go there.  Also how many of the shops apart from the Broadway are open after 7pm?</p>

    <p>The reason that Tesco can offer cheap prices is that they are a monopoly who is willing to drive off competition and force producers to sell for no money.  They aren&#39;t nicer than &#39;village&#39; stores...  they also break the planning laws and force appeals outside the Richmond Council and break all traffic laws... that isn&#39;t good or safe.</p>  <p>I would also warn that if you don&#39;t support local shops, you will get a high street that has only national chains (or no stores -- see Twickenham or &#39;pound stores&#39; see Staines or Houndslow) and then our village will look just like every other one in the county!</p>  <p>&#39;Welcome to <del>Canterbury</del>, <del>Sheen</del> <ins>St Martgarets</ins>"</p>  <p>Boots, Superdrug, Tesco, Greggs, McDonalds, Starbucks, Costa ... repeat.</p>  <p>We will find ourselves saying  "hey why are we all wearing all the same cloths, have the same curtains, picture frames, rugs, plates, furniture and buy each other the same gifts?"</p>  <p>I guess the good side is property prices might go down as you can tell one community from another...</p>

    <p>Peter,</p>  <p>A lot of what you write is true and I accept it, but the prices charged by &#39;local&#39; shops just aren&#39;t justified - remember Olivers? Maybe when they start trimming their profit margins or specialise in high quality produce (like Zorans do), then they will be able to compete. I would say that to a certain extent, the small shops are victims of their own doing. With regards to Tesco unfairly competing, I wonder if the original stalls, shops and newspaper sales boys in the 1950s and 1960s felt the same when the &#39;current&#39; newsagents came along and via the cash and carry supply chain and working more hours, were able to undercut them and put them out of business - it seems to me like it&#39;s just a case of evolution. If the residents don&#39;t want it, they won&#39;t use it and the Tesco will close down.</p>  <p>As an aside, the appearance of Starbucks is known to raise house prices in the area.</p>

    <p>The year is 2007. A lot of families have both couples working to make ends meet. Many people work shifts. Time becomes a precious commodity. Those points create the "need" and Tescos and other stores have provided the solution. Sunday shopping, 24 hour shopping and better value.</p>  <p>The day of the housewife pottering around various shops nattering the day away, whilst waiting for her husband to return from the coal pit have gone.</p>

    <p>James... sorry, I was having a rant, but, even if you might not have liked Olivers was very sucessful, so sucessful that they were purchased by Tesco for a lot of money.  They were hardly run out of business.</p>  <p>I personally don&#39;t dislike having a grocery store, even Tescos, I just want them to be a good neighbor.</p>  <p>I also don&#39;t want to see the local shops all disappear.  There should be some balance.</p>

    <p>Tesco&#39;s bought the store location, not Olivers per se, along with the other Europa stores in good locations.  It didn&#39;t matter what the location was used for before Tesco.  In fact if Olivers&#39; business model was a success then they would have hung onto the store and still be there raking it in.</p>  <p>Tesco&#39;s is a success and popular, as seen by the number of people that use it.  Its us, its customers, that have made Tesco the company it is remember, so no point complaining about them.  Shop elsewhere if you wish, its just that most of the population are happy enough with Tescos so it seems.</p>

    <p>I find the Superdrug far uglier and soul-destroying that Tesco. How did that ever get planning permission? It hardly ever seems busy and there are always more staff than customers. I don&#39;t understand how a shop of that size can survive, especially with no pharmacy.</p>  <p>I shan&#39;t shed any tears if it closes down, as long as yet another estate agent doesn&#39;t open up. A Swedish bakery and cafe would be nice, especially if staffed by buxom Swedish ladies in their twenties. I find the staff rather rude and service slow at Sunshine and Ravioli and am bored of eating from the fantastic Zorans.</p>

    <p>I agree with Gonville&#39;s remarks regarding Superdrug and will not miss it if it closes.  After all we have a good pharmacist in Crown Road.  What I would like to see is another butcher shop to replace FDrisby&#39;s and of course a good bakers shop and then Tesco could concentrate on groceries.  from Mrs. McCreddie</p>

    <p>I used to like sunshine and ravili until xmas when i was eating by the window and the shop was empty a person came in with a santa poster asking for them to display in their window. When the person left the lady manager and the young male assistant immediatly started mocking the poster, sticking 2 fingers at it and using swearing terms as F##k of santa, insulting our country and ripping the poster. I was staring at them gob smacked and responded to them when they started insulting our country and Xmas, the lady immediatly changed her tune, straigtening out the poster and saying how much she loves santa xmas etc but she did not understand why our country celebrate like this. I got up and left and haven&#39;t been back. If our festivities isint good enough for them then, neither is my money!</p>

    <p>Has that butchers next to Sunshine and Ravioli closed permanently now?</p>  <p>I remember it being open very occasionally last year - a rather old man was serving and no meat was in the window, but haven&#39;t seen it open recently - what&#39;s the story behind it and has it closed permanently?</p>  <p>Answers please, fellow St. Margarets Village residents.</p>

    <p>Peter [the one from 15/02/07] Wasn&#39;t particularly knocking Tesco, in fact they&#39;re welcome (even more so after this weekend&#39;s milk from Broadway -- &#39;sell by&#39; fine, but certainly distinctly strange taste), If only they&#39;d stick to what they&#39;re good at, which is NOT stocking a wide range of newspapers, magazines etc (dedicated -- plus friendly --newsagents), NOT stocking an enormous variety of wines, beers etc (dedicated -- plus knowledgeable -- off-licence), NOT stocking a comprehensive offering of medicines, potions etc (dedicated -- plus helpful -- pharmacy). And the &#39;new and refurbished&#39; Tesco is going to look even more like Broadway, an even higher percentage of its space dedicated to plonk.</p>

    <p>In reply to Kenneth Road, the elderly gentleman seen in the butcher&#39;s shop was Mr. Frisby, who has been there for many years.  His meat was kept in the cold room downstairs as the window display was not refrigerated.  His meat was excellent but old age and infirmity finally caught up with him and he had to give up the shop.  There has been a rumour that another butcher was interested in taking over but no further news on this has been received.  There was also a rumour that Koblers was being taken over by another bakers but this has not been substantiated. Does anyone know anything definite?  (Mrs. Mac)</p>

    <p>I agree with much of Peter&#39;s rant! Tesco in general and this store in particular routinely treat the &#39;local community&#39; with contempt.  They have not changed their frontage out of good will; they violated the original planning permission and pursued two appeals (at what cost to ratepayers?)to keep their original tacky frontage. The Post Office originally applied for an external cash machine; they were refused permission. Tesco put one in without planning permission and then applied retrospectively. There has been a constant struggle over delivery times and placements. It is only due to those who make reports/complaints that they have been restrained. Did Tesco put up a Christmas tree --following local tradition?  How much has Tesco donated to the Christmas street fair, other local community events? There are two town centres within walking distance where the &#39;clone&#39; experience rules. There is no need to have a &#39;strip mall&#39; here.</p>  <p>It is very convenient to have a good local grocery store at hand given the pattern of our working lives, but there are specific problems when it is part of a large monopolistic chain(over 1 in 3 food pounds spent, 1 in 8 retail pounds spent in Tesco). There are also alternatives that are time-efficient but less damaging....but that is for another post.</p>  <p>For now I think it worth pointing out that  once a parade of local shops loses its individuality -- it becomes anonymous, not just a clone.  This usually gives rise to more crime (would like to see some local figures on this) as the anonymous &#39;feel&#39;  encourages opportunist crime. The fact that the cash machine is outside rather than inside makes it more of a target.</p>  <p>The cash machine also means that people &#39;pull over&#39; blocking the bus lane. This combined with the parking on double yellow lines etc etc; creates more hazards for motorists, let alone pedestrians and cyclists. This reinforces the trend towards the strip mall.</p>  <p>Once national chains come into an area, rents rise and - since they pay the same rates as a small local business - and it becomes more and more likely that these problems will become worse.</p>

    <p>Frisbys Butcher Being a neighbour of Mr Frisby for the past two years I can let you know that there was substantial activity in the property after he hung up his meat cleaver. The basement was cleared out and I know a local butcher was interested in taking the property over. However all activity has ceased so I can only guess that interested has as well for the time being. Christmas Poster I&#39;m horrified that any member of my staff would behave in such a manner. I will investigate the matter. I do have policy of only displaying a limited number of posters which have to be either of a charitable or neighbourhood content. The poster mentioned may have been a commercial one which would not be permitted. Rudeness and slow service No smoke without fire. I accept that at peak times we can be hard pressed to ALWAYS be as polite as we should and deliver in a timely manner when our customers are queuing out the door. It&#39;s very stressful and we are human. Having said that there&#39;s no place for rudeness in my caf&#233; and this subject and the one of service levels will be addressed at our next staff meeting. Any suggestions and further comment are very welcome. My aim is to be the best and criticism helps me achieve that so thank you. Michael Olsen</p>
