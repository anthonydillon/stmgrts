    <p>Enjoyed your article.  I came across it by mistake looking for information about tomorrow&#39;s fair.  My father was born just north of Lafayette, LA and most of his family still resides there.  I grew up in Houston, TX but I&#39;ve always loved my Louisiana heritage.  I was in New Orleans about a year ago and fell in love with it all over again - the music, the food...  I&#39;m very distraught over what has happened in the Gulf.  This part of the world is very much a part of me and to see this happen on the heals of hurricane Katrina is so very sad.  In Louisiana they have a saying that I&#39;m sure you are familiar with - &#39;Laissez bon temp roulez&#39;.  Well, they do...hurricane winds or oil covered beaches, they do :)</p>
