    <p>Dear FOOTBRIDGE CAMPAIGNER,</p>  <p>Rumours abound that TFL actually made a site visit to the footbridge<br /> last Friday! The first since the public funded body formulated the<br /> proposal and entered into a stakeholder consultation. In any other<br /> business, I would say this lacked due diligence, logic and<br /> professionalism but then again TFL is a quango. Coincidentally, all the<br /> children&#39;s artwork was removed from the footbridge during the same<br /> timeline.</p>  <p>So, what now? To keep this campaign front and centre, It is time for<br /> individuals to contact lead decision makers personally. Many concerned<br /> residents and parents have already directly communicated with the major<br /> players, but the campaign would welcome anything you could do too! You<br /> may have your own story to tell about crossing the A316; you may be a<br /> concerned parent or resident; or maybe you are a concerned stakeholder,<br /> such as school, business, or community organisation. TFL should hear<br /> from all of you.</p>  <p>Those who will make the decisions are TFLs Managing Director of Surface<br /> Transport, Leon Daniels and the mayor, Boris Johnson. So, please keep<br /> this campaign alive and make a difference.</p>
