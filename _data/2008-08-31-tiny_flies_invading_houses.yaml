    <p>They sound like fruit flies to me. They breed like fury in compost heaps and compost bins. If you would like some more I&#39;ve got tons of &#39;em.</p>

    <p>Ed, I would have got an electrocutor but the invasion lasted only a few days.</p>  <p>I am trying to establish where the flies come from, (breed).<br /> The resident in East Twickenham (a lady scared of insects) thought the flies where breeding in her ceiling, coming down through the low voltage spotlights, called a pest control company.<br /> They identified the flies as `Fairy Flies` and offered to remove the spot lights, spray insectocides in the ceiling and on window frames and sills for &pound;70.00.</p>  <p>I googled Fairy Flies and found that they are tiny<br /> parasitic wasps (~3mm) that lay their eggs in other insects eggs.<br /> I thought it unlikely that female Fairy Flies enter the ceiling to find other insect eggs to lay<br /> their eggs in!</p>  <p>I tend to go along with Compost King and his fruit<br /> Flies and am wondering if vegetation cut down on river banks etc.and left to rott acts like a compost heap.</p>  <p>Colin, the tiny moth that attack horse chesnut trees I discounted even though some of these trees are near my house but the insects I found had translucent wings, not moth like at all.</p>
