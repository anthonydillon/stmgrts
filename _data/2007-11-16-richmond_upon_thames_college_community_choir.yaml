    <p>Dear Carol and Rachel, A friend and I are interested in joining a choir in the area.  We have both sung in choirs before.  Could we come along one evening and meet you?</p>

    <p>I&#39;m the coordinator of the Advocacy Service within the borough of Richmond and was wondering if I could enquire about your choir coming to visit a couple of my groups.</p>  <p>I work with individuals with disability and mental health issues, and run several groups to help people live independently, and receive the right support.</p>  <p>One of the groups is for people with physical sensory impairment who  have life long illnesses and are confined to wheelchairs. They have asked if I could you, and see where a couple of people from the choir could come and sing Christmas songs with them? It would be great if you could.</p>  <p>If you have any questions, please get in touch.</p>  <p>Look forward to hearing from you soon,</p>  <p>Danni</p>
