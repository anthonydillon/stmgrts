    <p>The St Margarets Association of Residents is an informal organisation of of volunteers. Now 24 years old, the Association was founded in response to the redevelopment of the St Margarets Business Centre - in order to ensure that the Centre&#39;s activities did not impact negatively on the 650-odd households that comprise St Margarets village.</p>  <p>A more detailed explanation will be posted on the site soon.</p>
