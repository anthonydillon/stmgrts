    <p>Cllr Geoff Acton has told me: &#39;I also received this and am forwarding to requested recipients for an answer.&#39;</p>  <p>It is a pity that TAP didn&#39;t publish their report themselves instead of sending it to Lord True to be glanced at, filed and forgotten. I did urge a member of TAP to do this but to no avail.</p>

    <p>I believe that Lord True deliberately withheld the TAP report. Why? Well, he is the kind of man to have made sure that he knew, at least, the gist of the recommendations before the planning meeting in December, because he prides himself on being in control. Nothing wrong with that - he is leader of the council -  but, in order to have been transparent and fair to everyone (in other words &#39;an honest broker&#39;) he should then have made this very important report available to all parties or postponed the planning meeting until it was in the public domaine. The problem that he had, in my opinion, was that he had already decided to approve the application and this report was going make life difficult for him and the councillors on the planning committee who had been told to toe the line, even if it meant going against their conscience and beliefs. Why do I think this? At that fateful planning meeting not one conservative councillor asked a probing question of Solum even though many issues were raised by members of the public and experts in the field of architecture and engineering. If it had not been such an important decision, it would have been laughable.<br /> So, back to the sidelined TAP report.If I were on this panel I would hand in my resignation. I would not waste my time trying to give honest and clear advice that will only be taken seriously if it is in line with the thinking of our leader! It seems that we have a council that not only ignores its residents but also its especially chosen advisory panels!</p>

    <p>The TAP report was printed at the Council offices and sent to Lord True on 7<sup>th</sup> December. A Council Officer attended the TAP meetings so the report was not a surprise. Documents for the Planning meeting were accepted up to midday on the 19th December. That left Lord True 11 days to submit the report.</p>  <p>Cover up?</p>
