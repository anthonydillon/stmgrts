## About this Site

This site was created by a group of local residents of St Margarets, Middlesex.  Our mission is simple -- help foster a stronger community identity.  There are no hidden agendas, no political affiliations and to date, all the work is volunteer.

### Who is Involved

The site was created by <a href="mailto:peter@stmgrts.org.uk">Peter Mahnke</a>, with input from Ann Murray, Angela Mahnke and Simon Chapman.

### How can you help?

Well, as you might have guessed, this site is no one's day job.  So if anyone has leads, ideas, events or wants to help contribute in other ways, please <a href="mailto:volunteer@stmgrts.org.uk">email us</a>.

### How was this site built?

It has been created using mostly free, or very inexpensive tools:

- the core of the site is based on a [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
  - for the first ten years, it ran on [Movable Type](http://www.movabletype.org)
* forums and comments run on custom software
* the train timetables, events, polls, directory, newsletter sign-up are based on custom Perl scripts

If you are interested, we are maintaining a [change log](/changes).

### The site doesn't look good in my Browser

The site is built with and validated against established web standards.  Your problem might be that your browser is older and doesn't render web standards well.  We can recommend switching to [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/firefox/) or [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/)

But read the license for more details or <a href="mailto:content@stmgrts.org.uk">contact us</a> if you have specific questions.

### Who is paying for the site?

Currently the site is being supported by Peter Mahnke, but over time, I hope that donations may offset some of the costs.  If you are interested in donating time or money, please <a href="mailto:support@stmgrts.org.uk">contact us</a>.
