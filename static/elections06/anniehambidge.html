<h2>Background</h2>


<h3>Tell us about your education?</h3>

<p>Girls Grammar School &#8230;Birmingham  Photographic College</p>


<h3>What are three jobs you have held?</h3>


<ol>
<li>Dept of Physical Metallurgy  Birmingham University ( Photography and Photo-Microscopy );</li>
<li>Civil Service  H M Inspector of Taxes:</li>
<li><span class="caps">USCI </span> International ( CR <span class="caps">BARD </span>) <span class="caps">USA.</span> Radiological /Surgical /Diagnostic instruments.</li>
</ol>





<h3>What are you links to the North Twickenham/St Margarets community?</h3>

<p>I spotted my present home , early one morning 1986 As a commuter I was crossing <span class="caps">A316 </span>on my way to Portsmouth .  Old Deer Park looked fantastic in that early morning sun and I spotted a &#8217; For Sale &#8221; notice.</p>

<p>Since then my daughters lived here and then I moved here permanently 1994.</p>



<p>We have always enjoyed and supported local traders St Margaret&#8217;s &#8230;and really appreciate the close proximity of Royal Parks ;Old Father Thames and of course Central London and all it offers . This is a fantastic location which offers benefits one imagines only exist in the countryside &#8230;and yet we are only 10 miles from the capital city .</p>


<h3>Why did/do you want to be a councilor?</h3>

<p>Having decided life would be more enjoyable if I spent more time with my daughters and enjoy my new grandchildren .</p>

<p>I will admit to always having been politically inclined .Never considered becoming  a Councillor but having been asked many  times , instead of being continually frustrated by the deterioration in the quality of life I was experiencing ; (traffic jams; graffiti litter ; abandoned vehicles etc) and ever increasing Council Tax&#8212;-I accepted the challenge to make things better or at least stop things getting even worse .</p>


<h3>What do you think are the top three issues for North Twickenham/St Margarets and what do you should be done about them?</h3>

<p>I don&#8217;t think it necessary to tell ME not to follow the party line. I am a free thinker .</p>


<ol>
<li>We need to positively control IN_FILL development & continue to protect and enable more enjoyment of the borough &#8216;s special appeal; it&#8217;s greenness; Riverside walks; and many listed buildings and continue to improve  Street Scene where ever possible ; realistically protecting  Open Space which is so vital in our densely populated areas.</li>
<li>Make sure that our local schools are seriously committed to providing our children the very best academic  learning environment, along with discipline. Encouragement / inspiration are also essential in these early years of personal development to create a  &#8216;the desire to want to contribute&#8217; and have respect for all around them .</li>
<li>To d/w finely balancing the necessity for commerce  /residential parking /residential status in St Margarets .</li>
</ol>




<h3>What areas are you passionate about and what committees would you like to sit on?&#8230;</h3>

<p>&#8216;passionate&#8217; is a bit too strong for politics as it usually indicates a tendency towards being irrational. &#8216;Prefer the word &#8216;committed&#8217;</p>


<p>I have been. from day one a Member of the Overview and Scrutiny Committee for the Environment  and will always continue to have major interest in that .</p>

<p>My major contribution has been the introduction of the Community Toilet Scheme and River logo on the borough&#8217;s literature  .</p>

<p>I see Ken Livingstone has copied the idea too &#8230;I must send him a bill !!</p>

<p>I am a Member of the Licensing Committee and was particularly  supportive of the <span class="caps">CUMULATIVE IMPACT ZONE  </span>being applied to our Town centres  especially because St Margarets falls between two town Centres .</p>

<p>I was very pleased to act as spokesperson for so many residents when the new Act made Local Government responsible for determination of cases rather than Magistrates Courts .</p>

<p>So far we seem to have read most Applications well. A result I feel, of listening to what residents concerns.  Time will tell .</p>

<h3>Are there any big things you are looking to achieve or change?</h3>


<p>The need to watch and desist John Prescot&#8217;s ideas as much and whenever possible.</p>

<p>continue our long committed resistance to further activity at Heathrow  which will have a devastating affect on people&#8217;s daily lives in this borough.</p>

<p>We are hopeful that the Parking issues we are currently studying will result in a definite improvement generally for residents but again it will be based on what the majority  request.</p>

<p>Like many of you, I too have submitted ideas for the Twickenham Riverside Development .</p>

<p>I just pray that we can finance a really good scheme for businesses as well as residents & that decision makers are not too timid in their choice .</p>

<p>Many more people from St Margarets would support  Twickenham as their Shopping Centre of choice if it was more inviting .  What a fantastic setting for a shopping centre &#8230;topped by an ultra modern library overlooking the Thames&#8230; where people can be seen having  fun.</p>

<p>Plus an outdoor roof top restaurant within the library setting  &#8230; that would be MY choice &#8230;but&#8230;</p>


<h3>If elected, how will you keep in-touch with your constituents?</h3>

<p>My email service is open to everyone.The Council website is excellent ;+ mobile phone ; +5xdays courier service to my home address; our regular Area Consultation Meetings ; +invitations to Resident Association Meetings ( when invited? ) ; your new website &#8230;and&#8230;&#8230;..</p>

<p> in 6-8 weeks time you will see a new <span class="caps">COMMUNITY NOTICEBOARD </span>in St Margarets.</p>

<p>I have asked  Khalid at the local Post Office to act a key holder for the Notice Board .</p>

<p>( Simon Chapman as Deputy ).</p>



<p>Is any thing else needed?</p>
