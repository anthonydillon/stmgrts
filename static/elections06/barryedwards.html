</ol>



<h3>What are you links to the North Twickenham/St Margarets community?</h3>

<p>I grew up on the Somerset Levels, a farming community and an area of outstanding natural beauty. This experience together with my father&#8217;s passion for gardening was the spark for my curiosity in understanding man and his environment. I then worked for the Nature Conservancy Council (now called English Nature) and qualified to Scientific Officer Grade within the Civil Service.</p>

<p>When I moved to London and tried sales work. I was successful and developed people and negotiation skills. This lead to starting a family based business working almost exclusively for the people of St Margarets. I have learnt many things as I have gone about my work, being active as a member of local voluntary groups, taking part in public consultations, appeals to get my child into local schools and developing my own projects (involving planning applications).</p>

<p>I am a member of St Margarets Traders, St Margarets Residents Association and Chairman of the local River Thames Society Branch.</p>

<p>I am also on the Mayor of London&#8217;s, London Waterway Commission, advising on the implementation of the London plan.</p>

<h3>Why did/do you want to be a councilor?</h3>

<p>I would like to be a Councilor because a) I was asked by the St Margarets Traders/St Margarets residents and b) over the years, my experience of living in St Margarets has taught me that the party political system was not correctly representing local people. The party political view always seemed to be put before that of the local residents.<br />
Issues</p>

<h3>What do you think are the top three issues for North Twickenham/St Margarets and what do you should be done about them?</h3>

<p>The political parties will use single issues e.g. green issues, safety or education to state how they will beat each other, but if you want the truth, it is not about a child-like party political fight. Important issues are always less likely to catch a head-line, or a sound bite, but usually they are the ones which should receive most focus.</p>


<ol>
<li>The adoption of active public consultation, in line with the requirements on the Local Development Framework. (The most important issue affecting the future of St Margarets). There is a condition in the new <span class="caps">LDF </span>legislation which must have a &#8220;statement of community involvement&#8221;. This is a contract between the local people and the Council regarding how the community should develop. I went to the initial Council consultations and found that the views of local representatives and residents were not being adequately incorporated. I will be interested to know how many website visitors are aware of this, or have been asked about the future of St Margarets in the <span class="caps">LDF </span>by political parties?<br /><br />
<em>Suggestion: I will have regular surgeries and rigorously examine the future Council proposals to ensure local community needs are incorporated within the <span class="caps">LDF.</span></em></li>
<li>The examination of infrastructure projects, inc new homes. We have to start looking at planning applications in terms of whether we have the school capacity for the children from new housing developments, the available sewage treatment capacity to avoid pubic health issues, the roads to cope with the increases in traffic movements etc.<br /><br />
Local residents are being forced by planning applications to suffer a reduced quality of life by increasing numbers of these projects. We cannot go forward with the current numbers of school appeals, traffic congestion and public health issues because of over-development.<br /><br />
<em>Suggestion: I will have regular meetings with - School Governors (re: numbers of appeals) and look at providing new schools &mdash; Consult with Highway planners to keep St Margarets moving (particularly putting yellow &#8220;keep clear&#8221; boxes on the <span class="caps">A316 </span>roundabout) and continue my work to ensure Mogden keeps within the conditions of its Abatement Notice and that further pressure is not placed on its limited sewage treatment capacity.</em></li>
<li>To improve the fabric of St Margarets. We have huge problems in using the essential shops and services. There are very few sites for recycling. Community events have not been adequately encouraged and open spaces and areas of architectural interest are under threat by unreasonable planning applications in Conservation Areas.</li>
</ol>



<p>St Margarets needs to be assessable. It needs 30 mins free parking for residents. In fact residents permits should be free, to stop commuters parking, but without financially hitting the local people. Business should not be charged for visiting our homes to do essential work. The Council should not charge Crown Road Community events for road closures and the organizers should have an increase in their community grant. We all love these events, let&#8217;s support them. St Margarets Traders should be able to manage its recycling initiative. I cannot understand the current difficulty. Development proposals should meet the highest ideals of Conservation Area Statements to protect open spaces and historic buildings.</p>

<h3>What areas are you passionate about and what committees would you like to sit on?</h3>

<p>I am passionate about keeping St Margarets an enjoyable and unique place to live. I live in St Margarets and the residents are best qualified and the hardest workers trying to build this community. I wish to be available and answerable only to them. As an Independent I am not bound by party political interests, so I will be able achieve the aims of the community without this political bias.</p>

<p>I would therefore like to sit on the Environment, <span class="caps">LDF </span>and Finance Committees to bring professional and local community scrutiny to Council plans and how our money is spent.</p>

<h3>Are there any big things you are looking to achieve or change?</h3>

<p>I would like to achieve a better level of democracy of a similar type to that achieved by Elmbridge Borough Council. For the last 25 years the Council has been controlled by Independent Councilors nominated by their own local Residents Associations. This has ensured that local community priorities come first. This would remove the party political spin we have come to expect from the current system.</p>

<h3>If elected, how will you keep in-touch with your constituents?</h3>

<p>I have already covered this, but I will further say that I will offer a level of availability and creativity for community issues never offered before. I will work with all local groups and this website to offer regular and an active consultation network.</p>

<h2>Fun</h2>

<h3>What is your favorite musical group/band/cd?</h3>

<p>I enjoy trying to write music and far too infrequently performing, mainly rock/folk. But I love the song &#8220;Knights in White Satin&#8221;, if only for the line &#8220;some try to tell me thoughts, they cannot defend&#8221;</p>

<h3>What is your favorite book?</h3>

<p>Again, I enjoy participation and have written a book called &#8220;How to have an easy life&#8221;. But I do like the work of Chekov. His words paint pictures in the mind as vivid as being at the cinema.</p>

<h3>What is the last book you read?</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/water/marine/uk/policy/marine-bill/index.htm">The Marine Bill</a>. A consultation document of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Yes it is really is a book 312 pages!!</p>

<h3>What are three places you have lived?</h3>

<p>As well as the places mentioned I have also lived in:</p>


<ol>
<li>Liverpool</li>
<li>Crewe</li>
<li>Newton Abbot.</li>
</ol>



<h3>What is your favorite meal?</h3>

<p>Mature organic roast beef from a Soil Association Supplier, food carefully produced and tastes superb.</p>

<h3>What is your favorite place to take a holiday?</h3>

<p>Lake Balaton in Hungary</p>
