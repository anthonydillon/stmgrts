<p>I&#8217;d like to build on and develop community relations, I&#8217;d like to develop understanding across sections of the community, to help appreciate diversity and assist North Twickenham being a safer, happier and more community based place to live and grow.</p>

<h2>Issues</h2>

<h3>What do you think are the top three issues for North Twickenham/St Margarets and what do you should be done about them?</h3>

</ol>

<p>Working on the above areas would be big achievements.</p>

<p>Meet them via various media, be accessible, listen and respond. I&#8217;d develop a collaborative team: I can&#8217;t do all of this alone. Draw on the resources of my colleagues in the local Labour Party.</p>

<p>Have a broad taste, like bands like The Streets, Oasis, <span class="caps">U2, </span>but have a particular admiration for Freddie Mercury, the world&#8217;s a duller place without him.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140030948/qid=1145783174/sr=8-2/ref=pd_ka_2/203-7603620-9673541" title="link to amazon.co.uk">The Chosen</a> by Chaim Potok, an inspiring story about the struggle for individuation.
