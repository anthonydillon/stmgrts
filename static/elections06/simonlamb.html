<h2>Background</h2>

<h3>Tell us about your education?</h3>

<p>I attended a State school in Grimsby, left after my O levels and went into the Merchant Navy where I trained as a navigating officer.  I left to go to Bristol University where I studied History, graduating in 1989.</p>

<h3>What are three jobs you have held?</h3>


<ol>
<li>Merchant Navy officer trainee (see above)</li>
<li>Graduate entrant into commercial functions of Shell UK</li>
<li>Company representative of Equitable Life</li>
<li><span class="caps">PGCE</span> Secondary school student (for 1 year)</li>
<li>Part time employee of a major funeral director (which is what I do now)</li>
</ol>



<h3>What are you links to the North Twickenham/St Margarets community?</h3>

<p>I represented the &#8216;old&#8217; central Twickenham ward for 4 years from 1998 and the current ward since it was created in 2002.  I am on the governing body of Orleans Infants School, regularly attend meetings in the area and spend time and money in local shops and restaurants.  I like to watch rugby and was at the <span class="caps">RFU </span>for the finals a couple of weeks ago.</p>

<h3>Why did/do you want to be a councilor?</h3>

<p>I have always been interested in politics (<a href="/static/colophone.html">Peter</a> will testify to this following our chat in the Turks Head a few weeks ago).  Organization is the only way to change things for the better and political parties are the most significant way to achieve change.  I enjoy the variety of the role since I get involved in planning problems, chaired many hearings into the new licensing system last year, deal with education in a practical way and &mdash; since I am a member of the Cabinet &mdash; have a say in the most important decisions affecting the Borough.</p>

<h2>Issues</h2>

<h3>What do you think are the top three issues for North Twickenham/St Margarets and what do you should be done about them?</h3>


<ol>
<li>Expanding educational opportunity so that more local children are able to attend local schools.</li>
<li>Restricting the growth of Heathrow Airport so that current arrangements are not changed &mdash; the end of runway alternation would cause significantly more noise disturbance for the majority of residents in the area.</li>
<li>Protecting the environment &mdash; the built environment in the sense of planning issues.  Infill development is always unpopular and the Council does what is in its power to resist it.  The natural environment in the sense of clean and tidy streets and well maintained public spaces and buildings.  Dealing with graffiti so that it does not take over &mdash; that is a never ending problem, I&#8217;m afraid.  Doing what we can to limit climate change &mdash; fewer car journies, better insulation and similar practical measures.</li>
</ol>



<h3>What areas are you passionate about and what committees would you like to sit on?</h3>

<p>Educational opportunity is hugely important.  Providing excellent schools that focus on all round development with good behaviour and student attitudes is vital if we are to encourage more local parents to send their children to local State schools.</p>

<p>I guess I will be on similar committees to now &mdash; licensing and planning.  It takes time to accumulate knowledge and experience in both fields and it would be silly to waste it.</p>

<h3>Are there any big things you are looking to achieve or change?</h3>

<p>Develop Moormead so that it is attractive for all sections and ages of the community &mdash; this would include major redevelopment of the pavilion.</p>

<h3>If elected, how will you keep in-touch with your constituents?</h3>

<p>Through newsletters and E mails.  Experience shows that people do not want to wait for a regular surgery. Any honest politician will say that few people ever attend surgeries &mdash; politicians need to be available when problems arise, not every other Friday evening.  People can &mdash; and do &mdash; get in touch by phone, letter or E mail at any time.</p>

<p>The Council will continue to have Area Consultation Meetings and we intend to have a community notice board in Crown Road before the Summer is out.</p>

<h2>Fun</h2>

<p>I like to play sport when I can and go to the gym 2 or 3 times most weeks. Unfortunately, I tend to go to the pub 3 or 4 times a week!</p>

<p>My children give lots of fun and demand lots of my time &mdash; Alex is 5 and Madeleine is 2 &#189; (she thinks the half is important)</p>

<h3>What is your favorite musical group/band/cd?</h3>

<p>Varies according to mood and times.  Cold Play have been a recent favourite, but I have been playing more Robbie Williams lately.</p>

<h3>What is your favorite book?</h3>

<p>I tend to read non fiction.  I particularly enjoyed <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0099479370/qid=1145782957/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/203-7603620-9673541
" title="link to amazon.co.uk">The Right Stuff</a> by Tom Wolfe &mdash; I am just too young to properly remember the Apollo Moon landings but that was an amazing endevour.</p>

<h3>What is the last book you read?</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0141019018/qid=1145782889/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/203-7603620-9673541" title="Link to amazon.co.uk">Freakonomics</a>.</p>

<h3>What are three places you have lived?</h3>


<ol>
<li>Germany (for 6 months)</li>
<li>Bristol</li>
<li>the borough of Richmond (the last since 1991)</li>
</ol>



<h3>What is your favorite meal?</h3>

<p>Something with pasta</p>

<h3>What is your favorite place to take a holiday?</h3>

<p>The Western United States or Canada.</p>
