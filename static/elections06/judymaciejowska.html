<h2>Background</h2>

<h3>Tell us about your education?</h3>

<p>St. Agnes, Isles of Scilly primary school, then Truro High School, Cornwall, then an MA European Politics, Brunel University.</p>

<h3>What are three jobs you have held?</h3>


<ol>
<li>Present &#8211; Chair of Richmond Environmental Information Centre (Voluntary)</li>
<li>2000/2002 &#8211; <span class="caps">GLA,</span> Research & Support Officer for Darren Johnson AM (Green Assembly Member)</li>
<li>1998/2000 - London Green Party, Election Campaign Manager</li>
</ol>



<h3>What are you links to the North Twickenham/St Margarets community?</h3>

<p>Lived in St. Margarets for 27 years (Richmond for ten years before that); children went to Maria Grey Nursery, Orleans Infants, St. Stephens, Waldegrave and then Richmond College. I worked for West London Institute and then Brunel University in St. Margarets.  Now active with North St. Margarets Residents&#8217; Association</p>

<h3>Why did/do you want to be a councilor?</h3>

<p>To give local people a committed representative on the Council, and to give Green issues a strong voice locally</p>

<h2>Issues</h2>

<h3>What do you think are the top three issues for North Twickenham/St Margarets and what do you should be done about them?</h3>


<ol>
<li>Community  &#8211; without a doubt the most important issue, from which all others stem</li>
<li>Local schools should be available for local children so that primary school children can attend their community school with their friends and without having to travel by car</li>
<li>Local businesses &#8211; support should be given to help local businesses survive the onslaught of the Superdrugs and Tescos.</li>
</ol>



<h3>What areas are you passionate about and what committees would you like to sit on?</h3>

<p>Planning, there is so much potential for good planning and, unfortunately some opportunities for abuse.</p>

<p>Also, Education &#8211; I&#8217;m still not convinced that the need for a local primary school has diminished</p>

<h3>Are there any big things you are looking to achieve or change?</h3>

<p>Unfortunately even the majority party is unable to change much in four years, but I will certainly give the leading administration a headache as I rattle cages for the community, e.g. on a local school for primary children; the Mogden pong; Heathrow 3rd runway; support for local shops and businesses</p>

<h3>If elected, how will you keep in-touch with your constituents?</h3>

<p>I will hold regular surgeries; I will visit local people and shopkeepers; I will always be accessible by e-mail and phone</p>

<h2>Fun</h2>
