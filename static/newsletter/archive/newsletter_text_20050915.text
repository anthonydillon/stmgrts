APPLICATION FOR WINE BAR RE-SUBMITTED
-----------------------------------------------------------
    A group of local businessmen (Grapespot Ltd of Kingston) 
    have resubmitted their application to open a wine bar in 
    the basement formerly occupied by Phelps. This application 
    requires a change of use (A4) to the property. Grapespot's 
    plan to call the wine bar ParVinu at Phelps and offer 
    retail wine sales, wine tastings and seating and a bar 
    for drinking and dining on site.

INTERVIEW : NICK DOLAN OF REAL ALE
-----------------------------------------------------------
    In May of this year, Nick Dolan opened a new local business, 
    Real Ale on the high street in East Twickenham. As you might 
    have guessed from the name, Real Ale offers a wide selection 
    of the finest real ales and ciders that are produced by British 
    micro-breweries. Previously, you could only get these by visiting 
    the breweries or a few local outlets.
