===========================================================



ï»¿ST MARGARETS VILLAGE PLANNING CONSULTATION AND DROP-IN SESSION
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Drop in session at Twickenham Film Studios - 10am to 4pm on 11
    October 2015

    Following three Question Time events, in the January 2015, a series
    of drop-ins and walkabout sessions were held in these three
    villages, to collate information from residents about their local
    area, particularly key areas of interest, particular features and
    what residents would like to see improved.

    All the information gathered through the consultation, has now been
    incorporated into draft Supplementary Planning Documents (SPD).
    These documents contain the vision for the area and planning
    guidance that the Council, residents, and other land owners should
    take into account when considering development proposals or making
    planning applications in these three areas.

    You are now invited to review the draft SPDs and give your views
    before they are formally adopted early next year.

    A consultation has been opened online. In addition, drop in
    sessions will give residents an opportunity to view and discuss the
    documents with Council officers.

MOORMEAD PAVILION - EXPRESSION OF INTEREST
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    After several rejected attempts and constant pressure from our
    local councillors and the Friends of Moormead, Richmond Council has
    finally decided to do something about the derelict pavilion
    in Moormead Park. They are now open to Expressions of Interest
    from parties interested in doing something with the building. If
    you are interested, you have until 2 December 2015 to contact
    the council.

HOUNSLOW COUNCIL PLANS TO CLOSE CHURCH STREET IN ISLEWORTH
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Hounslow Council plans to close Church Street, which runs
    through Old Isleworth to Syon House along the Thames, on 7 December
    2015 as a "temporary trial" of 18 months to see if road users
    change their "travelling habits". But how can the parents and
    children of the five schools on these roads together with hospital
    staff and patients "change their traveling habits"? Local residents
    will still need to get about and people will still want to visit
    and use the amenities of Syon Park.

    Hounslow Council has said that it will not stop the "trial" once
    they have started it but confirm that the closure will cause
    significant disruption.

    If this affects you, there is a petition to stop the trial
