<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2008/07/postcall_in_statement_of_the_st_margarets_cpz_exte.html">Post-call in statement of the St Margarets&#39; <span class="caps">CPZ </span>extension</a></h3>

<div class="letter">

<p>We condemn the decision confirmed at the recent meeting of the Richmond Council&#8217;s Environment Overview and Scrutiny Committee to include two more roads in the St Margarets&#8217; <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CPZ </span></span>because:</p>


<ol>
<li>It defies all normally understood principles of democracy that a majority in these two roads of only 13 votes can trump over 300 against in the consultation area.</li>

<li>It undermines the purpose of a consultation that confusing information on procedures is given on the Council&#8217;s website and in its literature.</li>
<li>It compromises the electoral process that inadequate figures were available on which voters could base their decision, e.g. the Council&#8217;s Beat Survey, giving the full facts on vehicles parked at different times in the area was withheld (this showed that night time parking was worse than daytime, so residents will be paying for nothing).</li>
<li>In makes a mockery of the consultation that the Council&#8217;s database of addresses is flawed, so that a business park, some flats and users of a service road adjacent to the new <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CPZ </span></span></span>extension were left out.  Consulting them now is calculated to force them into the <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">CPZ, </span></span>when instead the whole exercise should have been declared invalid.</li>
<li>It is indicative of the Council&#8217;s attitude to accuracy that the committee Char, Cllr Mumford, should joke that a questionnaire was sent to a bus stop in the Teddington <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CPZ </span></span>consultation last year.</li>

<li>It is absurd that representations from a single resident that a further road should be included in the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CPZ </span></span></span>(with a majority of only one, originally considered insufficient by the Council) should receive sympathy and an assurance of an early review, when serious concerns expressed by eight residents who spoke strongly against the <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">CPZ </span></span>were largely dismissed.</li>
<li>It is unacceptable that the Lib Dem majority on the committee should be satisfied with assurances from David Trigg, Cllr for Transport, and from Council officials, that all requirement had been met, when clearly they hadn&#8217;t.</li>
</ol>



<p>We thank Cllrs Head and Hodgins for challenging the decision on our behalf, and Cllr Seymour, Vice-Chair of the committee, for supporting us.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2008/07/toss_oars.html">Toss Oars!</a></h3>

<p><img src="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/shallop-thumb.jpg" width="150" height="112" alt="Cubs on the JUBILANT"  align="right" style="padding: 2px;"
 /></p>

<p>Even Kings and Queens like to get away to the country at the weekend and their favourite way of getting there was by Shallop - an 8 oared pleasure barge with a comfy glass-sided, cabin in which to chill out. Faster than walking and much more comfortable than riding in a coach, a well crewed shallop could get from Greenwich to Hampton Court in about 4 hours. The trip would take longer if the boat stopped at Twickenham Ait for some of Mistress Mayo&#8217;s famous eel pies, a particular favourite with Henry <span class="caps"><span class="caps">VIII.</span></span> Shallops were the riparian version of the stretched limo. Fast, comfortable and stylish.</p>

<p>In the past shallops were crewed by liveried oarsmen with years of experience and bulging muscles. Last week it was the turn of the boys of 1st St. Margarets Cub Pack with little experience and no muscles. Their boat was the Royal Shallop &#8220;Jubilant&#8221;, owned by the Queen and looked after by the 14th Richmond Viking Boating Centre. It was not going to be a simple paddle around the bay. Rowing a shallop means learning orders - and obeying them. (Novices should pay attention here just in case Her Majesty drops by for a quick trip up river)</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Visitors got into the &#8220;true community feel&#8221; of the St Margarets fair as they helped raise over &#163;14,000 for charities and community projects.</p>

<p>The 30th anniversary of the event, in Moor Mead Garden, was celebrated by thousands - many of whom stayed into the evening listening to the variety of bands who performed.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The meeting of the Environment &amp; Sustainability Overview &amp; Scrutiny Committee on Thursday 17 July agreed to &#39;note&#39; Cllr Trigg&#39;s decision to extend the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CPZ </span></span>to Bridge and Winchester Roads. This means that the extension will be implemented without further delay. Cllr Trigg has agreed:</p>


<ul>
<li>to review his decision to exclude Sidney Road [which split 50/50] with a view to early inclusion;</li>
<li>to re-consult The Mews; and</li>
<li>to bring forward the review from 6 months to earlier if need be; the area to be reviewed is large and any new problem areas will be highlighted.</li>
