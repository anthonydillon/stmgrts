EVENT REMINDER: BIG BAND BLITZ 2008

    Step back in time, return to the 1940s and dance the night away
    at Big Band Blitz.  This popular and highly successful annual
    1940s event will this year celebrate the 20th Anniversary of the
    opening of The Museum of Richmond by Her Majesty
    Queen Elizabeth II.

    Proceeds from this special charity event will help benefit
    The Museum of Richmond's charity. Royal Patron of the charity
    is HRH Princess Alexandra, and the Patrons include Richmond's
    famous brothers, Lord Richard Attenborough and
    Sir David Attenborough.

    Big Band Blitz re-creates a 1940s WWII Glenn Miller night
    of entertainment, featuring the Jon Bennett Big Band playing
    the music of Glenn Miller and other big bands from the 1940s,
    plus special guests from the world of entertainment. There will
    be 1940s period dress and memorabilia, food and drink from the
    NAAFI, licensed bar, the Air-Raid Warning, a celebrity raffle,
    plus a few surprises.

SPONSOR A BRITISH FAMILY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The makers of The Secret Millionaire are looking for a charitable,
    wealthy family interested in supporting and mentoring an
    underprivileged family for a new observational documentary
    for CH 4 where we will take an intimate look at child poverty and
    the ever growing economic divide in this country
    -- specifically London.

    We are searching for a wealthy British family, based in London,
    with children to get involved with our program.  The idea is
    for the wealthier family to mentor and sponsor an underprivileged
    family where they will learn first hand what its like to live
    in poverty.  We would like to give both families the opportunity
    to learn how the other half lives.  We would like genuine
    relationships to form and different view points expressed.  We
    want to present a very fair and balanced view with the hopes
    of breaking down cultural and economic stereotypes.

    At this stage we are looking to film on and off over the course
    of three months.  We also have the established 'Westminster Child
    Society' charity on board to offer their support and expertise.

    If you are interested or would like to learn more about our program
    please feel free to contact Meghan on 0207-013-4556 or you can
    email meghan.just-truelove@rdftelevision.com

YELLOWWEDGE CHEESE, WINS GOLD
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    After Beijing, the gold rush continues. An independent, south-west
    London cheese retailer, yellowwedge cheese, in St Margarets,
    Twickenham, has won the prestigious trophy for Best New Deli
    at the British Cheese Awards 2008.

    The Best New Deli award, sponsored by SpecialityFood Magazine,
    presented to yellowwedge cheese at the British Cheese Awards 2008
    on Friday 26 September at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, aims
    to celebrate and recognise new independent cheese retailers
    promoting a fantastic range of artisan British cheeses with flair
    and passion.

SAFER NEIGHBOURHOOD POLICING AT MOORMEAD PARK
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    What's happening in Moormead Park?

    Antisocial behaviour was the main topic at a police street
    briefing with the residents and our local Safer Neighbourhood Team
    on 23 June at Moormead Park. With the longer summer days upon us
    residents, police and the Council were keen to combat this
    behaviour. The following actions have been taken:

    * The red metal bench next to the park has been removed. This is
      to deter youths congregating in this area, where there was
      evidence of cannabis smoking and drinking.

    * A temporary CCTV has been installed overlooking the play area.

    * The local Safer Neighbourhood Team has changed their shift
      patterns to work later at weekends to help combat Anti Social
      Behaviour. For example, on a recent Saturday and Sunday, 16 people
      were stopped and asked to account for themselves between midnight
      and 2am.

    * A test purchase operation has been conducted at local off-licences
      using police cadets. This has led to one local off-license being
      prosecuted, and will hopefully make it harder for youths
      to purchase alcohol.

    * Any child found to be drinking underage by police will have their
      details recorded, social services will be notified and a letter
      sent to the parents.
