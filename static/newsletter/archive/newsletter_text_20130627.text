ï»¿A SURFEIT OF LAMPHREYS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    "Some of the most primitive vertebrates still alive today, river
     lampreys (Lampetra fluviatilis) are small, eel-like fish
     with toothed, sucker-mouths. They use this sucker to attach to
     other fish, rasping away at the flesh and feeding on bodily fluids.
     They also feed on carrion."

    Next time you feel inclined to go wild swimming in the Thames or
    even dangle a toe consider the case of 16 year old Marilyn Bell
    from Toronto who in September 1954 started off on a record breaking
    swim across Lake Ontario. As Time magazine later reported she was
    barely out from the shore when...

NOW OPEN
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    We welcome Susan Roster and her clothing business - The Secret
    Wardrobe, a designer dress agency to St Margarets which is now open
    at 22 Crown Road.

    Susan contacted the St Margarets Traders Association via the
    Looking for Premises in St Margarets page on the traders website
    to register her interest in St Margarets. The St Margarets Traders
    association were able to put Susan in touch with a local landlord
    who was looking for a new tenant. The previous shop remained
    trading at the premises whilst the paperwork was being completed
    and this has resulted in a seamless changeover of tenant for
    the landlord.
