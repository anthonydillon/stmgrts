    Your Vision, Your St Margarets, Your East Twickenham

    At the end of 2010 Richmond Council sent every household the All
    in One survey, which asked about the priorities of residents in
    each local area. We asked what people liked about where they lived

BUSINESS START-UP SURVEY
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    St Margarets is a hive of entrepreneurial activitynad Richmond Upon
    Thames has one of the highest levels of self-employment anywhere
    in the country. Richmond Council wants to help that those thinking
    of starting a business, or those in the early stages of starting
    up, to access the right support to give the best chance of success.
    To do this, the Council and support providers need to know more
    about the challenges and needs of new or emerging businesses.

    You can help to inform future support provision and help other
    start-ups by contributing your thoughts in a very short survey.
