<p>Welcome to the St Margarets Community Website Newsletter (<a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk">www.stmgrts.org.uk</a>). Occasional Thursdays we will send you the latest news and events from the website.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2014/06/the_dday_dodgers.html">The D-Day Dodgers</a></h3>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;We&#39;re the D-Day Dodgers, way off in Italy<br />
Always on the vino, always on the spree;<br /><br /><br />
Eighth Army scroungers and their tanks,<br /><br /><br />
We live in Rome, among the Yanks.<br /><br /><br />
We are the D-Day Dodgers, way out in Italy.&#8221;</p>

</blockquote>

<p>On the 6<sup>th</sup> June 1944, as units of the British 2<sup>nd</sup> Army and their allies stormed ashore on the beaches of Normandy, men of the British 8<sup>th</sup> Army, the Desert Rats, and their <span class="caps">U.S </span>allies were liberating Rome. One campaign is remembered and honoured to this day. The other is forgotten.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2014/06/tfl_consultation_on_a316_st_margarets_crossing.html"><span class="caps">TFL</span> Consultation on <span class="caps">A316</span> St Margarets Crossing</a></h3>

<p><img src="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/assets/images/2014/a316-st-margarets-map_thumb.jpg" width="150" height="102" alt="a316 st margarets map" align="right" style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 1px;" /></p>

<p>The <span class="caps">TFL </span>are proposing to improve accessibility to crossing facilities at St Margaret&#39;s roundabout, Twickenham.  They say:</p>

<blockquote><p>We propose to remove the footbridge located west of St Margaret&#39;s roundabout and install a new toucan crossing. This would provide an accessible crossing at this section of the roundabout which at present is not accessible to everyone.</p>

<p>A toucan crossing allows both pedestrians and cyclists to cross the road at the same time. It is wider than other formal crossings which would mean that cyclists would not have to dismount when crossing. The toucan crossing would be staggered and have an island in the middle.</p></blockquote>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2014/06/twickenham_choral_society_a_hundred_years_of_histo.html">Twickenham Choral Society - a Hundred Years of History</a></h3>

<p><em>After nearly a hundred years, Twickenham Choral Society is on the move</em></p>

<p>Founded in 1921 as the Twickenham Musical Society, we moved to our current venue in Clifden Road, Twickenham, in 1922.   At the time, the building was a high-achieving girls&#39; school, the Twickenham County School for Girls (TCS).   We still rehearse in its wood-panelled assembly hall.  Many of us have spent the odd idle moment gazing at the gold lettering on the walls depicting the A level and Oxbridge achievements of former pupils of the 1940s, 50s and 60s, wondering where they are now and whether they too sing.</p>

<p>Over the years, we have seen many changes. In the 1970s, we changed our name to the Twickenham Choral Society (also <span class="caps">TCS</span>) and a few years later, the school buildings became part of the Richmond Adult College, now the <span class="caps">RACC.</span> Yet the hall has remained, little changed since the 1960s and still sporting the emblem of the long-gone Middlesex County Council.  Its silent lists of gold-lettered names have stood witness to thousands of weekly rehearsals covering a vast repertoire of works.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2014/06/reader_question_idling_trains.html">Reader Question - Idling Trains?</a></h3>

<blockquote><p>Hi I wondered if I was the only one in St Margarets being kept awake in the dead of the night by trains parking up with their engines running for a couple of hours whilst engineering work goes on ? I enquired at the station but it was a waste of time. I rang South West trains they knew even less. Anyone got any suggestions?</p></blockquote>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2014/06/a_message_from_richmond_police_theft_of_plants_and.html">A Message From Richmond Police - Theft of plants and pots</a></h3>

<p>Just to make you all aware we have had a significant increase in the theft of plants, trees and shrubs from residents front gardens</p>

<p>Most of these items are very heavy and would require transport to remove them and the majority of alleged thefts are being carried out overnight</p>

<p>The nice weather is encouraging us all into our gardens but the downside is it also encourages thieves&#8230;</p>

<p>Please can you be extra vigilant and also wherever possible property mark your pots as you would do with valuable property inside your house as you never know if we stop vans with plants and pots in them we can restore them very quickly with a postcode or address on them and arrest the suspect&#39;s) immediately</p>
