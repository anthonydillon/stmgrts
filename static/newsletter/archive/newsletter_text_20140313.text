﻿CLAP HANDS - HERE COMES CHARLIE!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Charlie Kunz - August 18th 1896 - March 17th 1958

    Looking at the slim, quietly spoken, elegantly tail-suited man
    with the flower in his buttonhole and the 'patent leather' hair it
    is perhaps difficult to imagine that Charlie Kunz was one of the
    biggest stars of his time. According to some he was the highest
    paid pianist in the world, earning around 1,000 pounds a week and
    although he died 56 years ago his records continue to sell.

EVENT REMINDER: "WHAT WAS THAT" - 10 MAY 2014
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Communication in the Natural World with Sir David Attenborough

    Sir David Attenborough will be 'speaking' to Patagonian woodpeckers
    and revealing the treacherous communication of fireflies. All
    around us animals sing, croak, buzz, flash colours, leave scents
    and even dance - sending messages to each other in a dazzling
    variety of ways. What they are saying and is it always the truth?

EVENT REMINDER: MEET THE BREWER - 20 MARCH 2014
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    After so many years of decline, London is experiencing a resurgence
    of brewing, with as many as 50 commercial breweries currently
    operating in London. An incredible increase since 2006 when
    YoungÊ¼s Brewery left London and there were only eight
    breweries remaining.

    We have long supported many of these breweries and enjoyed watching
    them grow and develop their beers. We thought it was time we
    invited just a handful of the newest breweries to come and join us
    and give you the opportunity to meet their brewers, try some
    of their beers and share in one of London's current success
    stories.
