<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2013/10/the_bridge_at_eel_pie_island.html">The Bridge at Eel Pie Island</a></h3>

<p><img src="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/assets/images/2013/EELPIE_The_Bridge_thumb.jpg.pagespeed.ce.Hx3SvYkscs.jpg" width="150" height="90" alt="The Bridge" align="right" style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 1px;"/></p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Grand Jazz Band Ball&#8221; said the Melody Maker&#39;s advertising column. &#8220;Fully Licensed - Cy Laurie&#39;s Jazz Band - Eel Pie Island.&#8221; I hadn&#39;t heard Cy Laurie at the time, but I liked the sound of Eel Pie island. It seemed to go with &#39;Gut Bucket&#39; or &#39;Honky Tonk&#39;. It had the right feel to it. It not only sounded right. It looked right too.</p></blockquote>

<p><cite><span class="caps">GEORGE MELLY </span>- &#8220;Owning Up&#8221; (1965)</cite></p>

<p>People have been making merry on Eel Pie Island since Victorian times and before&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;It had come to pass that afternoon that Miss Morleena Kenwigs had received an invitation to repair next day, per steamer from Westminster Bridge unto Eel Pie Island at Twickenham: there to make merry upon a cold collation, bottled beer, shrub and shrimps, and to dance in the open air to the music of a locomotive band&#8230;&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><cite><span class="caps">CHARLES DICKENS </span>- &#8220;Nicholas Nickleby&#8221; (1839)</cite></p>

<p><img src="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/assets/images/2013/150x151xEELPIE_eel_pie_hotel_1920_thumb.jpg.pagespeed.ic.y5Zd5CAkzN.jpg" width="150" height="151" alt="eel pie hotel 1920" align="right" style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 1px;"/></p>

<p>When local antique dealer Michael Snapper bought the old and gently decaying Eel Pie Island Hotel in the early 1950&#39;s the locomotive band had been replaced by <em>&#8220;a rather washed-out trio playing foxtrots and what-not to half a dozen people.&#8221;</em> Business at the hotel was very slow and locals were beginning to talk of Snapper&#39;s acquisition as a white elephant. The hotel badly needed renovation, the entertainment wasn&#39;t attracting anybody and worse of all - the only way you could get there was by a small ferryboat. Although he may not have realised it at the time what Mr Snapper needed to save his hotel was a) something that would attract large numbers of people, b) ideally people who wouldn&#39;t be too bothered by the tatty decor of his hotel and c) people who would really &#39;dig&#39; the fun of a ferry boat ride. The answer was right under his nose.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/directory/group/201310091623">Richmond Local History Society</a> is kicking off its new season of lectures and other events on subjects of local historical interest with a talk on Shrovetide football.</p>

<p>Christopher May, the Society&#39;s new Chair, will speak about <a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/event/event/200705144176">The death of an ancient manly sport: Shrovetide football in Richmond and vicinity</a> on Monday, 21 October 2013. His talk is at the Duke Street (Baptist) Church, Duke Street, Richmond <span class="caps">TW9</span> 1DH, starting at 8pm, with coffee available from 7.30. The talk is free to members. Visitors are welcome: admission &pound;2.</p>

<p>Christopher May said:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Two hundred years ago games of football were traditionally played on Shrove Tuesday though the main streets of Richmond, Twickenham, Mortlake, Kingston and other places nearby. This was not football as we know it today with its marked out pitch, its limited number of players and its set of rules &#8212; both soccer and then rugby only got their rules half a century later. Shrovetide football was unruly, rough and tumble, boisterous and drunken. The gentry thought it uncivilised; shopkeepers deplored the damage and the loss of business; so the local authorities tried it suppress it, but it would take them several decades and changes in the law and policing for them to kill the game and stop the labouring classes taking over the town for one day of carnival every year.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="caps">SPEAR </span>is a local charity providing support for people who are homeless. We help people move off the streets and address the issues that may have led to their homelessness so they can start living a much better life.</p>

<p>Our flagship event is The Big <span class="caps">SPEAR</span> Snooze where the community takes part in a sponsored sleepout to raise funds and awareness for our work. This year the sleepout is happening on Friday 8 November at St Mary&#39;s Community Hall / Church in Twickenham.</p>

<p>We are looking for people who would be willing to sleep outside for just one night to help those living without a home.</p>

<p>There is supper and entertainment provided beforehand, and breakfast in the morning. Although it&#39;s a challenging event, we promise it&#39;s also very memorable and an experience you will never forget.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2013/10/looking_for_a_babysitter.html">Looking for a Babysitter?</a></h3>

<p>I&#39;m a 15 year old seeking babysitting and childminding jobs. I study at Orleans Park School and I am responsible, mature and reliable. I love working with kids and I can also work at short notice. I am happy to pick children up from Orleans Primary School or St Stephan&#39;s CE Primary School on Tuesdays through Fridays and bring them home. I can also do evening and weekend babysitting in the St Margarets area.</p>

<p>Please don&#39;t hesitate to contact me with further questions or queries on 07564440158</p>

<p>Thank you. Charlotte.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2013/10/join_interview_circles_in_twickenham_autumn_2013.html">Join Interview Circles in Twickenham - Autumn 2013</a></h3>

<p>The world premiere of <a href="http://www.interviewcircles.org/">Interview Circles</a>, will be happening in Lulu&#39;z cafe in Twickenham on Wednesdays in October and November 2013 at 10 am.</p>

<blockquote><p> &#8220;Would you love to be listened to. Here&#39;s your opportunity - so long as you can listen constructively to someone else.</p>

<p>Interviewing is conversation when we focus on one person at a time.  This allows them to develop ideas, share experiences, and develop skills as a presenter and raconteur. Meanwhile the interviewer is learning about people, how to put them at ease, help them develop and bring their experience to the common human experience.</p>

<p>Might this help you prepare for a real-life situation, develop your plans, bounce your ideas off other people, overcome nasty experiences, and enjoy yourself, develop your network of contacts and make new friends as you do so?&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Drop in if you are interested.</p>

<em>Dismay as many fish die in River Crane pollution</em>

<p>Shocked nature-lovers woke up this morning to discover the River Crane poisoned, leaving many fish dead once again.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency was called following several reports that a section of the river at Twickenham had turned black and fish were in distress.</p>

<p>The source of the pollution has been traced to an outfall pipe upstream of the <span class="caps">A30.</span></p>
