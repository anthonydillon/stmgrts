RICHMOND COUNCIL TAX RISE PLANNED FOR 2018
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Faced with massive cuts in Government funding, Richmond Council
    will be raising Council Tax to protect the key services that
    residents want and need.

    Historically, under successive Governments, Richmond upon Thames
    has been poorly funded. The four year Finance Settlement arranged
    in 2016 has resulted in Richmond losing its Government General
    Grant by 2018/19. This continues to leave Richmond as the lowest
    funded Council in London with the Council Tax paid by residents
    covering an ever higher share of service costs.

EEL PIE ISLAND GETS ITS OWN MUSEUM
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    A museum dedicated to the rich musical- and river-related history
    of Eel Pie Island, Twickenham has opened its doors at 1-3 Richmond
    Road in Twickenham.

    Following a successful crowdfunding campaign, match-funded by the
    Mayor of London, and with the sponsorship of local businesses and
    organisations, and the support of Richmond Council, the Museum now
    enjoys a permanent location in the heart of Twickenham.

RICHMOND COUNCIL ASKS FOR NEW APPROACH WITH LEVEL CROSSINGS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Following feedback from residents, businesses and ward councillors,
    particularly at recent Village Planning Questiontime events, Cllr
    Paul Hodgins and Cllr Peter Buckwell met with Network Rail
    to discuss level crossings in Richmond upon Thames.

SPONSOR AN ELM IN RICHOMOND PARK - ONLY 5 LEFT!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    The Friends of Richmond Park, and The Royal Parks, have launched an
    exciting project to plant over 40 disease-resistant elm trees
    in Richmond Park.

    Elm Walk will be a new avenue of trees along the path from
    Petersham Gate. The start of the Elm Walk will be marked with an
    elm tree presented by the Friends to Sir David Attenborough on his
    90th birthday.
