THE NIGHT ST MARGARETS CAUGHT FIRE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    One night in November, 68 years ago...

    The Nazi bombers came at night from the east, navigating their way
    along the Thames to their aiming points in South West London. We 
    will probably never know what the Luftwaffe crews were actually 
    aiming at but on Friday 29th November 1940, in a raid that lasted 
    nearly 6 1/2 hours, some 130 high explosive bombs and between 3,000 
    and 5,000 incendiary devices rained down on St Margarets, 
    Twickenham, Richmond, Isleworth and Teddington, destroying 150 
    houses and damaging more than 6,000 others. It was the area's 
    biggest raid of the 2nd World War.  A German government communique
    stated later that it was a 'Reprisal Raid' directed towards
    military targets.
    
    There were many casualties. Mr and Mrs Sydney Clark and their dog 
    were killed by the sheer concussion of a large bomb 5 feet high and
    18 inches wide that crashed into their dining room. The bomb failed 
    to explode. Mrs Dawson and her 2 children died under falling masonry.
    Tom Brown, an old soldier and his wife, were both blown up. They
    had known each other since childhood. One bomb hit an underground 
    shelter causing the deaths of 8 wives and children of men all 
    disabled in the 1st World War. Another bomb hit a pub and killed 
    16 customers... the list goes on and on.
