    To celebrate the New Year, the St Margarets Traders Association

    a state of the art Canon Camera to the winner of this competition.
    You can enter as an individual, group, class or partnership. All 
    you have to do is answer one simple question, see the Traders 
    Association website http://www.mystmargarets.com for full details.

DIETS TO DIE FOR
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    "I never worry about diets. The only carrots that interest me
     are the number you get in a diamond."

     -- Mae West


    A sorry failing of us humans is our desire to always look our 
    best - and we go to extraordinary and sometimes fatal lengths 
    to achieve this. In the past we thought nothing of using lead 
    based make-up for that perfect white complexion, removing teeth
    to give a fashionable  'hollow cheeked' look and even following
    potentially fatal dietary regimes.
    
    Such was the case with one of St Margarets most illustrious 
    residents, the writer and humorist Thomas Chandler Haliburton.
    In 1863, realising that he was seriously overweight, Haliburton
    took up the fashionable Banting diet, the high protein forerunner
    of the Atkins Diet.  Initially he managed to lose 10 inches around 
    his waist. Unfortunately the Banting Diet had the same regrettable 
    effect on Thomas Chandler Haliburton as the Atkins Diet had 
    on its creator. Haliburton died on August 27th 1865 and was buried 
    in All Saints Churchyard in Old Isleworth. To the abiding gratitude
    of the pallbearers, he was a few stones lighter than his
    former self!
