RICHMOND TO CHARGE FOR SCHOOL-RUN
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Parents in Richmond could be paying up to L75 to drive to school.
    
    A controversial scheme that charges parents who drive their 
    children to school could be adopted by local authorities across 
    the UK. Richmond Council in Surrey plans to charge parents up 
    to L75 a year for using their car on the school run. The council
    says it wants to cut CO2 emissions, but the AA and a group 
    representing parents calls it unfair.  The Local Government 
    Association says other councils battling car congestion will 
    watch the scheme "with interest".
    
    From September, Lib Dem-controlled Richmond wants to charge
    parents up to L75 for a 15-minute parking permit allowing them 
    to park in bays near their child's school.

EVENT REMINDER: PETERSHAM VILLAGE OPEN GARDENS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    This May bank holiday the villagers of Petersham will be throwing
    open their gardens to the public to help raise money for the 
    Petersham Trust. Ten gardens will be included in the ticket price
    of L10 per adult or L20 per family - under 16s are free.
    
    With gardens ranging from the grand and elaborate to classic 
    cottage gardens, there is a wealth of variety, size, style and 
    design to enjoy, together with an abundance of plants and flowers
    on display. Delicious home made cakes and teas will be served at 
    the Village Hall in Bute Avenue, and face painting will be
    available to keep the little ones amused.
    
    The gardens, all privately owned, are spread around Petersham and
    are all within ten minutes walking distance of the Richmond Park
    Petersham Gate entrance opposite The Dysart Arms. Buses 65 and 371 
    stop. Directions will be displayed throughout the village.

FITNESS TIPS AND NEW CLASS SESSIONS FROM GEOLIFESTYLE.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    How to improve fitness levels.
    
    1.  Always warm up for about 5 minutes before you do 
        any exercise. If you are going out running, start off 
        by walking so you get yourself ready for your run.
        Stretching is not necessary before a run, but will 
        help reduce muscle soreness at the end of your exercise
        session. Again cool down for about 5 minutes.
        
    2.  Avoid running the same route all the time. Try a new 
        route to help keep you motivated.
        
    3.  Head out to Richmond Park and try running a few hills. 
        These are great to improve your strength and fitness 
        levels. Start off slowly and remember not to increase
        your efforts by more than 10% per week to help avoid 
        injuries.
        
    4.  Cross training is a great way to improve strength. Get
        out on your bike and cycle, or visit the local swimming 
        pool and do some lengths.
        
    5.  Vary your training programme so you do not get bored. 
        Try a speed session, strength training or a long run.
        
    6.  Make sure if you are heading out for more than 60 minutes,
        take a sports drink with you. This will help keep you 
        hydrated whilst providing important energy for your
        longer session.
