NORMAN JACKSON  V.C -  A LOCAL HERO
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    "I was young and cocky and thought I could do anything. 
     But I did no more than anyone else would do."

    Norman Jackson was born in Ealing on 8th April 1919.  When he left
    school he qualified as an engineer. Although he was married and
    in a reserved occupation, on the outbreak of the 2nd World War 
    in 1939 he volunteered for the RAF and trained as a Flight Engineer.
    On 20 July 1943 Warrant Officer Jackson joined his first squadron, 
    No 106 based at Syerston, in Nottinghamshire, flying
    Lancaster bombers.
    
    He and his new crew settled down well together and by mid-November
    had completed 14 sorties against targets in Germany. On a trip 
    to Munich on 24 April 1944 Jackson completed his required tour 
    of 30 sorties when he flew with another crew whose own flight 
    engineer was unavailable. Two days later, on 26th April 1944, 
    when his own crew were listed to complete their own tour 
    of 30 sorties, Jackson cheerfully agreed to fly with them although 
    there was no need for him to do so.

THE MARATHON DE SABLES: 1 WEEK TO GO!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    I'd firstly like to say a big thank you to all those who have 
    kindly sponsored me to do this mad race, please if you would like
    to help me raise money for F.R.O.D.O. then please visit my just 
    giving site at justgiving.com/georgie-islip Thank you for all your 
    support as it will keep me going through the tough stages 
    of the race.
    
    For 15 years I have wanted to do this incredible race and now it
    is imminent, less than a week away. I can't quite believe it. All
    my training and work has been done and I'm just doing the odd run
    to keep myself confident and in shape. I now need to pack and build
    myself up mentally.
