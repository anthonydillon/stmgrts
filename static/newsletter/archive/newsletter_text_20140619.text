HEIR TODAY, GONE TOMORROW
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Once upon a time there was a man living in these parts called Henry
    Budd and he was absolutely loaded. Not only did he own the
    riverside estate "Twickenham Park" in what was to become St
    Margarets but he also had properties on Marine Drive in Brighton
    and Russell Square in London as well as a rather prestigious family
    mausoleum at St Matthews Church in Brixton.

    Henry Budd was born in 1787 and in 1805 married Charlotte Swain.
    They had a number of children who unfortunately seemed to die
    young. Their first son Richard popped off in 1830. In 1848 wife
    Charlotte followed suit, swiftly followed by youngest daughter
    Emmeline in 1851 and older daughter Charlotte in 1854. The family
    mausoleum - clearly a sound investment - was kept busy.
