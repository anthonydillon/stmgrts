ï»¿BARNEY IN THE BARONS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    FRANCE early 13th century

    AMAURY - Simon, I've got two lots of good news and two lots of bad
             news for you. What would you like first?
    SIMON  - Oh, is this a game?
    AMAURY - Kind of... just choose one.
    SIMON  - How exciting. Right. I'll start with some bad news.
    AMAURY - The bad news is Dad's dead.
    SIMON  - Dad's dead? Oh dear... and the good news?
    AMAURY - The good news? He had a lot of money and land - and he's
             left it all to me. You get nothing.
    SIMON  - Oh...
    AMAURY - ...because you're the youngest son. It's the eldest son -
             moi - who gets the ducets.
    SIMON  - I'll remember that! Right. Any more good news?
    AMAURY - There is some land that Dad forgot about and you can have
             if you want?
    SIMON  - Could be useful....and the bad news?
    AMAURY - The bad news is the land is in England and you'll have
             to go over there and ask the King for it back!

CLASS: A TASTE OF OPERA AT THE NORMANSFIELD THEATRE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    This 10 week course on Wednesday evenings 7pm to 9pm from 19
    September, will be a lighthearted, guided tour through the
    development of opera, illustrated with a variety of recent and
    historic audio and video recording. You don't need to have an
    extensive knowledge of operas to enjoy this course, just an
    interest to learn more about them.

    We're also hoping to run this course every term, so if you are
    interested in the January course, please let Lesley know.
