MOORMEAD PARK CONSULTATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Moormead Park is an important part of St Margarets, but hasn't 
    been well maintained for years. Now the Richmond Council has set 
    aside a budget to help improve the park. Additionally a new group 
    has formed, the Moormead Park Group, made up of local residents 
    and representatives of the cricketers, footballers, St Margarets' 
    Fair Committee and local businesses. They have circulated paper 
    questionnaire at the St Margarets Autumn Fair and door to door 
    with local residents.
