LATEST NEWS
===========================================================



CPZ RESULTS PUBLISHED
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The report on the CPZ consultation has been published.
    
    Overall, 52% of households responded to the survey with 65% saying
    they do not want a CPZ and only 36.8% saying they would want a CPZ
    on their road if everyone else wanted one.  Most people didnï¿½t 
    care about the stopping up of the rear of 141-143 St Margarets 
    Road (49.4%) or about a car club (41.3%).

EVENT REMINDER : FREE PRESENTATION BY THE LEASEHOLD ADVISORY SERVICE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The purpose of the meeting is to hear from a representative 
    of the Leasehold Advisory Group (LAG) about:
    
      -  How to extend the length of your lease (and what the 
         law says the lessor can ask for)
      -  Purchasing the freehold of your properties (Collective 
         Enfranchisement)

 ST MARGARETS FAIR 2007
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The 29th St Margarets Fair comes to Moormead on Saturday the 14th
    of July, between 11.30 and 7.30pm.
    
    Our support this year is for the Alzheimer's Society, Heatham House 
    and the Richmond Thames Boat project, in addition to our continuing
    help to Radio West Middlesex, Marble Hill play centres and our
    local schools.  There's live music on the stage from 11.30 onwards,
    and the usual established favourite activities, including  last 
    year's new popular attraction - the dog show.  If you haven't had
    one already, you should shortly receive the full programme through
    your letter box.
    
    The Fair Committee have always strived to ensure that it remains 
    primarily a Community event, and therefore we are always grateful 
    for your support, and especially everyone living very close 
    to Moormead. We all hope you have an enjoyable time in the sunshine 
    we've come to expect for the day of the Fair.
    
    -- from The St Margarets Fair Committee
