ï»¿THE COTTINGLEY FAIRIES
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    In the summer of 1917, in the small village of Cottingley
    in Yorkshire, 15 year old Elsie Wright and her 10 year old cousin
    Frances Griffiths were enjoying a holiday together. Frances had
    just arrived with her mother from South Africa and was staying
    with Elsie in Yorkshire while Frances's father was away fighting
    the war in France. The two girls spent the summer playing in the
    woods that ran behind Elsie's house... and it was in these quiet
    woods that Elsie and Frances meet the fairies.

SCHOOLS IN LOOKING FOR HELP WITH ACADEMY STATUS DILEMMA
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Secondary schools across Richmond are looking for help deciding
    whether to break away from tradition and become self-controlled
    academies instead of council-led schools.

    Three schools in the borough have already made the switch; becoming
    Twickenham, Hampton and Richmond academies, and the area's
    remaining five secondary schools are now contemplating their
    own futures.

    "In Richmond, the council is encouraging schools to convert, and is
    transforming itself to take advantage of similar freedoms. It is
    therefore right that we explore whether to convert, and whether it
    would help ensure increasing success for our students in
    the future."

    All five remaining council-led schools are undergoing consultation
    with parents, staff and governors about whether to convert
    to academies.

NEW CADET UNIT FOR TWICKENHAM CADETS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Right Honourable Dr Vince Cable MP for Twickenham was guest
    of honour at the official opening of the long awaited new cadet
    centre in London Road Twickenham.

    Cadets, staff, friends and supporters toured the new building which
    will serve the needs both of 196 Twickenham Army Cadet Force (Royal
    Engineers) Detachment and of 267 (Twickenham) Squadron Air
    Training Corps.

    Unveiling the commemorative plaque Dr Cable said;

    "As a local person I am very pleased to have been asked to open
    this joint Army and Air Cadet centre. The cadets provide a great
    service to the local community here in Twickenham. This centre will
    at last provide both cadet units with a place where they can learn
    together the many skills that the cadet world offers. I wish you
    well in your cadet times."

"BAMBOO STICKS" EXERCISE  - 16 OCTOBER 2011
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Sunday, 16th October 2011 at 9am in Marble Hill Park near the
    car park

    Local resident Daphne Cotton is offering an introductory session
    to this unusual exercise routine in aid of Amnesty International.
    Otherwise known as the "Art of the Longevity Stick", these
    exercises will strengthen your body, build up your immune system
    and make you feel good, especially if you do them first thing in
    the morning out in your local park. The half marathon completed,
    Daphne would now like to see 100 local residents out in Marble Hill
    Park on Sunday morning to complete her fundraising activity. If you
    have already donated to the cause it is free and if you don't wish
    to donate, come anyway and explore Bamboo Sticks!
