Welcome to the St Margarets Community Website Newsletter. 
Each Thursday we will send you the latest news and events from the website (https://stmargarets.london).



LATEST NEWS
===========================================================



ï»¿THE KINGSTON ZODIAC
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Maybe it was a reaction to the horrors of the 1st World War but
    in the 1920's there was a revival of interest in mysticism,
    paganism, ancient beliefs and the romantic tales of King Arthur and
    Uther Pendragon. We may have won the Great War but it was a brutal,
    messy business. In the myths and fairy tales of the dark past maybe
    we hoped to find a more civilised, more chivalrous heritage.

SCHOOL ANXIETY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    It's a fact that there is an anticipated shortfall of 306 school
    places Borough wide in the 2012/13 academic year.

    At the gates of your average nursery or pre-school in and around St
    Margarets' there has been a lot of discussion and anxiety
    surrounding schooling. Where will we get a place for our little
    ones when they are 4? Will we get a place? Will we have to traipse
    across the Borough to go to a school not of choosing? Many parents
    have been surprised that they simply have not been given a place
    for their 4 year old due to the chronic shortage of places.

    In addition to this, the Council has recently shelved 50% of the
    development plans to build additional forms which has put the issue
    even more into the limelight.

    So, what are people doing about this? Where did you end up
    schooling your 4 or 5 year old this September and how far from your
    home do you have to travel so that your child can attend this
    school? We'd love to hear people's stories, so please leave a
    comment here (and a street if you can) and vote in our poll

EVENT REMINDER: REAL ALE WINE TASTING - 20 OCTOBER 2011
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Given the success of our monthly beer tastings, we felt it was time
    to introduce some of our great wines currently available. So we've
    linked up with our two favourite wine suppliers to give you the
    chance to try 8 different wines from our selection.

    This is the perfect opportunity to learn more about wines - the
    different grape varieties, different regions, how to taste wine and
    what food accompanies different wines.

    We're pleased to be joined by Phil Barnet from Les Caves and
    Elizabeth Killick from Stratford Wines - both experts in
    their field.

WARM YOUR COCKLES THIS WINTER WITH VOCALITY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Richmond based 'choir-with-a-difference' Vocality offers to warm
    the cockles of your heart this winter with the pleasure of
    communal singing..

    Vocality rehearses in central Richmond on Tuesday evenings
    8.00-10.00pm, and is now welcoming new members as it begins a fresh
    programme of uplifting harmony songs from around the world.

    No auditions and no sheet music means that anyone can enjoy singing
    with this choir. Their fun and friendly approach attracts people
    of all ages and already counts a number of St Margarets residents
    among its members.

    Their experienced choir leader will soon have you relishing the
    sounds of an energetic Slokavian gypsy dance, a spine-tingling
    African American spiritual, a delicate Swedish folk song and an
    evocative Bugundian Christmas Carol, among others in this
    term's repertoire.

    The choir will be giving a pre-Christmas performance to showcase
    their achievements.

    Vocality is offering a free taster session to try it out. Please
    see their new website www.vocalitysinging.co.uk for more details.

COME AND PLAY WITH THE TWICKENHAM SCRATCH ORCHESTRA
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Adults - do you play an orchestral instrument?

    We meet a few times a year. This is for grown-ups and for the fun
    of spending one evening playing through some music. No performances
    and no regular commitment.

    An indicative standard is Grade 5 and above, but we are pretty
    relaxed. Everybody is welcome - don't worry if you haven't played
    for ages or have little experience of orchestral playing. Our
    (honorary) conductor is Daniel Meyer, local professional violinist
    and conductor. He tries to encourage us musically, but keeps it
    relaxed and friendly.

    We gather from around 8'ish and play for about an hour and a half,
    with time for a drink and chat after if you wish. There is a modest
    charge (to cover room and music hire) and you need to bring your
    instrument and a music stand.

    Please let us know if you might be interested and what instrument
    you play by email to Tim Elliott tim.elliott@virginmedia.co.uk
