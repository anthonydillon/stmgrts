ï»¿A LIFE DOWN BELOW
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    "There is something in a sewer, .... Down below
     That has a strange allure, ... Down below,
     The magic of the drain, is a thing you can't explain,
     But it's calling me again, ... Down below."

     -- Sydney Carter

    Back in those dim and distant days when public services and
    utilities were owned and run by the very people who used and paid
    for them, i.e the public, my Uncle Tom worked for Hornsey Borough
    Council in the Sewage Department. Officially he was a 'Sanitary
    Worker' but to the rest of us he was 'a flusher'. When asked what
    that entailed he said "Sorting the solids from the liquids" which
    was enough to stop any further questions. Every morning, with a
    flask of tea and some sandwiches stuck into an old Oxo tin, Uncle
    Tom would disappear down a hole somewhere in North London,
    to reappear hours later from another hole miles away. He sometimes
    smelt a little whiffy when he came home but he said 'The effluvia
    clears my chest'. Sometimes the effluvia cleared the house.

VISIT ORLEANS HOUSE GALLERY'S EXHIBIT, RUDI PATTERSON
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Orleans House Gallery presents the biggest ever retrospective of
    one of the UK's leading black artists, Jamaican born Rudi
    Patterson (1933-2013).

    With 91 paintings and featuring many unexhibited works from the
    artist's private collection, this unique showing explores Rudi
    Patterson's amazing legacy. From his mid-twenties Rudi lived
    in England, almost exclusively in West London. He composed mostly
    Caribbean scenes - vivid mountain landscapes, plantation villages,
    luxuriant tropical vegetation and crops, and still life beaches
    with rivers flowing onto them.

HELP MAKE A NEW ITV SERIES: NEIGHBOURS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    In London, only 1 in 10 of us count our neighbours as friends and
    so we want to film with a number of households on one street
    over six weeks in the summer to find out more about the people that
    live there. We'd then like to offer those people the opportunity
    to gain an insight into each other's lives and see whether this
    makes a difference to their relationships with each other.

    As a result, the series will look at life at home today on a mixed
    street; we will get to know the people who are filming with us and
    see from different perspectives all the things that unite us:
    family relationships, work stresses and joys, conversations over
    the dinner table, what makes us happy and what makes us sad.
