     efforts reach out far and wide to improve communities. Undeniably,
     volunteers rock!"

    -- Canadian Volunteer Promotion

    nationwide celebration of the extraordinary contribution millions
    of volunteers make to our lives. To mark the event here is a brief

ST MARGARETS PARKING REVIEW - SECOND STAGE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    For people living in the St Margarets area, you will hopefully be
    aware that Richmond Council is consulting on proposals to change
    the parking zone areas.

    Following an initial consultation, the Council is now undertaking a
    'second stage' consultation with specific proposals to extend
    Community Parking Zones S and S2 and to implement a New Zone S3.
    The Council is also re-consulting roads in the Heathcote
    Road/Cassilis Road area on proposals to extend the existing Zone S
    due to demand from residents of Heathcote Road and the displacement
    or 'knock on' effects a CPZ north of the A316 may have upon the
    area to the south.
