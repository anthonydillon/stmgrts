<p>Welcome to the St Margarets Community Website Newsletter (<a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk">www.stmgrts.org.uk</a>).  Each Thursday we will send you the latest news and events from the website.</p>

<h3>Tesco Seeks Permission for a Second <span class="caps">ATM</span></h3>

<p>According to a new planning application, the Tesco on St Margarets Road is seeking permission to add a second <span class="caps">ATM </span>to the right of the entrance. The <span class="caps">ATM </span>would be accessible from the outside of the store, like the current one. As part of the application they are proposing to raise the level of the pavement out approximately 4-5 feet.</p>

<h3>Letters to America : Driving on the wrong/other side of the road</h3>

<p>We are going to run a series of emails from local resident and American ex-Pat, Stephanie Grefsheim, sent to her family and friends back in the <span class="caps">USA</span>&Eacute; we hope you enjoy them.</p>

<blockquote><p>When our daughter first heard we were considering moving from the US to England, she just couldn&#8217;t stop laughing. She thought it was a joke. Nevertheless, we are here and the things that are different are not necessarily what we anticipated&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<h3>Notes from the Area Consultation Meeting</h3>

<p>A loud and heated Area Consultation for St Margarets and Twickenham Riverside Wards was held on the 31st of October at York House. Approximately 60 residents met with local councillors to get an update and discuss local matters. While many issues were discussed, clearly the key issue for the residents and local traders was the unwanted transformation of the high street &#8212; specifically the issues around Tesco and Superdrug. Other items discussed in some detail was the matter of commuters parking in St Peter&#8217;s Road creating havoc for local residents, the parking issues in general, licensing questions and other planning and planning process concerns.</p>

<h3>Charity Box Thief Sentenced</h3>

<p>A thief who stole the charity box from Cutters in Crown Road has been prosecuted for theft and has been sentenced by Richmond Magistrates Court. Toby King stole the box in July this year; the theft was recorded on the stores c.c.t.v. system and was used as evidence against King.</p>

<p>King was sentenced to an attendance centre order for 24 hours and ordered to pay &pound;30 compensation to the charity.</p>



<h3>Details Emerge on Tesco&#8217;s Loading Bay</h3>

<p>Last month the Richmond Council granted Tesco&#8217;s request for a larger loading bay on St Margarets Road. Over the past few days details have emerged regarding the specifics of the implementation of the new loading bay. The actual implementation appears to be far more lenient towards Tesco than previously suggested in the Council&#8217;s Cabinet Report.</p>

<p>It seems the bay will not only be longer, but substantially wider than it currently is. Also, the rules for the bay will also be more far more forgiving for Tesco and harder for residents than they are currently.</p>
