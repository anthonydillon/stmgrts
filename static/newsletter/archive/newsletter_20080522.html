<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2008/05/st_margarets_to_send_medical_team_to_help_romanian.html">St Margarets to Send Medical Team to Help Romanian Children</a></h3>

<p>A group of St Margarets&#8217; families has recently become involved with a UK charity working in Romania. FRODO (Foundation for the Relief of Disabled Orphans), accesses urgent medical treatment for disabled children who have been orphaned or abandoned and are last in the line for healthcare. Romania remains the country with the highest incidence of abandoned children anywhere in the world - there are hundreds of children without decent medical care.</p>

<p>Set up by Robin Nydes, an investment banker, the charity is appealingly small and dynamic. With a core staff of only four it has helped over 150 children directly since it was started two years ago.</p>

<p>A Treatment &amp; Training programme where senior consultants from Great Ormond Street give up two weeks of their time to work with Romanian medical specialists in their hospitals will see 100 children and operate on around 25.  These efforts, given freely, will transform the lives of these children.</p>

<p>Our ambition is to set up a St Margaret&#8217;s community initiative to sponsor one of FRODO&#8217;s Treatment &amp; Training programmes. It costs &#163;25,000 to directly help 25 children to a new life and to support a further 75.</p>

<h4><a href="https://stmargarets.london/event/auction/200705141854">FRODO Kids - Presentation; Winchester Hall: Thursday 5 June, 7.30-8.30pm</a></h4>

<p>On Thursday 5 June we will be running a short presentation on the charity with the aim of inspiring others to join in the endeavour.  There are a number of things people have already committed to doing, as starters;</p>


<ul>
<li>FRODO team in the London Duathlon - Richmond Park, September, all runners &amp; cyclists welcome</li>
<li>Cake Stall at St Margaret&#8217;s Stall</li>
<li>Promise Auctions</li>
<li>St Margaret&#8217;s Wardrobe Swap</li>
<li>Film and photography visit to Romania</li>

<li>&#8230; and a school&#8217;s initiative which gets the kids not just giving their pound but knowing who it&#8217;s going to and why</li>
</ul>



<p>If you would like to hear more about Romania, and the St Margaret&#8217;s community initiative we look forward to seeing you.</p>

<h4>How to beat your exercising excuses.</h4>


<ol>
<li>Make sure you warm up well. Begin your warm by walking for 2 minutes and then start jogging. Run easily for about 5 minutes. Taking walking breaks when you need them.</li>
<li>Keep your pace slow. Do not run too quickly as this will make the session hard.</li>
<li>Run somewhere new so you do not get bored of your running route.</li>
<li>Try running some of the free 5K time trial runs in the local parks. These are great fun and provide a good monitor as to how your training is working out.</li>
<li>Have a go at a new exercise class. Do a workout that you have not done before. This will keep you motivated and help supplement your training.</li>
<li>Start to run using a heart rate monitor. This will provide a good indicator to how hard you are training and your progression.</li>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2008/05/flash_planning_refused_for_66_crown_road.html">Planning Refused for 66 Crown Road</a></h3>

<p>At the planning committee meeting on the 15th of May the application to turn the former doctors surgery at 66 Crown Road into 2 two bed flats, 1 one bed flat and a studio flat was refused. This was despite the planning officer having recommended that the proposal be granted.  Forty residents had registered individual objections to the proposed plan which initially included a suggestion that the development would take the doctors parking bay and use it for their own personal use. This was then amended with a suggestion that the number of parking permits would be legally restricted to two permits from that address. The committee was concerned at the amount of flats being proposed in the development which would not even have left room for sufficient space for bicycle parking for all the householders.</p>

<p>Local ward councillor Phillip Morgan spoke on behalf of the residents concerns and said afterwards that he was very pleased with the result which shows that &#8220;democracy does work and councillors do take account of local residents views. It was very unusual to have 40 individual objections and showed a high level of public concern about the proposal.&#8221; It is now up to the developer whether or not they wish to appeal or to try again with new plans. Hopefully they will want to be more considerate of their neighbours with any future plans.</p>
