LATEST NEWS
===========================================================



ï»¿THE 'AUSTERITY' GAMES -  JULY 29 TO AUGUST 14 1948
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    When the Olympics came to Richmond

    64 years ago, in 1948, Britain was in a situation very similar
    to today - flat broke, up to its neck in debt and with a very
    expensive Olympic Games to pay for.

    This wasn't the first time that the Olympic Games had come
    to Britain but it was the first time that they had come here
    as originally planned. In 1908 the Summer Olympics - the Games
    of the VI Olympiad - were scheduled to take place in Rome but on
    7th April of that year Mount Vesuvius erupted obliging the Italian
    government to move its cash and its attention to rebuilding Naples.
    London quickly stepped in and brought the games to Britain. Despite
    the lack of preparation the UK did rather well in the medal count
    winning three times as many as the USA who came second. (I should
    add, of course, that winning medals is not what it is all about. It
    is the taking part that is important. O.K?)
