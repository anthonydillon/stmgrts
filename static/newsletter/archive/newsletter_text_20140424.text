ï»¿LOW-KEY LEGENDS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    group with a new style jumped out of nowhere and went straight to
    No 1 in the U.K charts and stayed there for 9 weeks. It was the
    first of over 26 UK chart hits for this band, 9 of them reaching
    No. 1. To date they have sold over 380 million albums and singles
    around the world which makes them one of the best selling music
    acts of all time. They have won Eurovision and motivated any number
    of successful tribute bands. Their music has been the inspiration
    and creative drive for at least three popular films, one of which,
    in 2008, became the highest grossing picture in the U.K. On the
    15th March 2010 the group were inducted into the 'Rock and Roll

    Our summer training programme has just started and we are keen

    cricket.

    We are based at Whitton Park (190 Wills Crescent, Hounslow TW3 2JD)
    and training takes place every Sunday from 10am - 12pm. This will
    continue until the end of the school term in July 2014.

    We now have 10 qualified and DBS (previously CRB) cleared coaches
    provided coaching to boys and girls of all school age groups.

    We run a u11s, u13s, u15s and u17 team in the Middlesex Colts
    Association competitions and arrange friendly games for children
    aged under 9.

    resident of Orleans House, has returned for the second year
    running.

    He sits 30 feet up on the archway to the Stables Courtyard
    and quacks.

    He is gaining quite a following.
