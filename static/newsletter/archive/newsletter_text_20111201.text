ADVENT
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Advent (Lat, adventus, arrival). The four weeks before CHRISTMAS,
    beginning on St. ANDREW'S Day (30th November), or the Sunday
    nearest to it, commemorating the first and second coming of Christ;
    the first to redeem, and the second to judge the world.

     - BREWERS Phrase & Fable

    It is too late now. There is no escaping. We're into Advent and
    Christmas is coming up fast. If it wasn't for the kids you wouldn't
    bother, eh?

    It used to be worse. In the 5th century Advent began on the 11th
    November, St Martin's Day, and it took the form of a six week fast
    up to Christmas. After about a hundred years of fasting like this,
    (n.b that's 'fasting' not 'feasting') it was eventually decided
    to shorten Advent to its present length and forget the fasting.
    Cheers all round!

    Advent marks the beginning of the Christian year and Advent Sunday
    - which this year fell last Sunday 27th November - is known in the
    church as "New Year's Day."

TWICKENHAM AIR CADETS THROW OPEN THE DOORS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Twickenham's 267 Squadron ATC threw open its doors last night
    to welcome family, friends and former cadets at a special open
    evening at the new Cadet Centre in London Road.

    Over fifty visitors saw the cadets of all ages enjoying a range
    of activities from First Aid to aircraft modelling, and a lesson
    on the principles of flight.

    The Cadet Centre was officially opened in October by Dr Vince Cable
    and this is the first opportunity for parents and potential cadets
    to visit the new premises.

    Middlesex Wing Commander David Hale said "You have a very fine
    facility here - it will not have the charm of the old one but it is
    you young cadets of today who will give the centre its tradition
    for the cadets of the future. I am grateful to the staff and the
    families who provide you with so much support and encouragement."

    On the final parade of the evening, and watched by proud parents,
    Wing Commander Hale announced the promotions of both Tim Evans
    to Cadet Sergeant and Tara Crank to Flight Sergeant.

    Eighteen year old Flight Sergeant Tara Crank, formerly of Whitton
    School, plans a career in medicine and enjoys fencing as her other
    hobby. She modestly admits to being in the top 43 in senior ranking
    in the UK Fencing world.

    The squadron will now continue with its normal parade activities
    on a Tuesday and Thursday evening at the London Road Cadet Centre.
    Young people interested can make enquiries at the centre on either
    of these evenings or find out more at www.aircadets.org

MUSIC AT THE FAIR - 4 DECEMBER 2011
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    We're often asked for more information about the bands that play
    at the fair. Please find below a short bio of each of the bands.

    St Margarets Elastic Band

    The St Margarets Elastic Band are back again to play their
    Christmas selection of popular hits- the band gets a bit bigger
    each year (possibly too many mince pies) and now boasts a tuba or
    two to provide that extra bit of early morning music excitement

    Anacousis Jazz Quintet

    The name's Greek for Hear Us.We play quality Jazz for everyone. We
    like to entertain, and play from the classic Jazz era Our mellow
    sounds come from the Sax, and Bb/Bass Clarinets, supported by a
    fine rhythm section. Visit: www.anacousisjazzquintet.com

    Shelle Luscombe

    Shelle Luscombe lives in Twickenham and sings a real mixed bag
    of popular covers from the 50s to the present day. She touches
    on just about every genre of music from jazz, blues and soul
    through to motown, disco and good old rock n roll. Check out
    www.shelleluscombe.co.uk to hear tracks and view Shelle's
    demo video.
    3am

    Soulful, passionate vocals fronting blues-guitar-based rock songs
    written by the band or inspired by the best female singers
    including Janis Joplin, Etta James, Gladys Knight and Elkie Brooks.
    Blues you can get your teeth into!

    Richmond Youth Brass Band

    Richmond Youth Brass Band has performed at many prestigious events
    across the Borough including the Mayor of Richmond's Charity Ball
    and concerts for Hampton Fuel Allotment Charity and Richmond Parish
    Lands. The Band, for 8-16 year olds, is run by Richmond Music Trust
    and meets on Saturday mornings at Waldegrave School. For more
    details see: www.richmondmusictrust.org.uk

    Orleans Brass Bunch

    Orleans Brass Bunch reformed earlier this year playing creative or
    unusual arrangements of well known pieces, such as Mango Walk and
    Linstead Market. The group is sustained by the real fun and
    enthusiasm of its players drawn from years 7-11, as well as the
    parents and brass coaches who support it.

    Anthony Alix band

    Alix is from New York and toured America, including a night
    supporting Duran Duran at Madison Square Garden, before stints
    in Toronto and Dubai. His trio now plays London with his funky soul
    hits and what a big sound 3 people can make!

    A special thank you to all of the bands and to Alistair Wright
    of Radio Jackie who organises the music at the fair and act as MC.
