<p>Welcome to the St Margarets Community Website Newsletter (<a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk">www.stmgrts.org.uk</a>). Occasional Thursdays we will send you the latest news and events from the website.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2009/03/save_our_high_street.html">Save our High Street</a></h3>

<p><img src="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/assets/images/2009/nosh-thumb.jpg" width="112" height="150" alt="Nosh"  align="right" style="padding: 2px; border: 1px solid #ccc;" /></p>

<p>Not to point out Nosh in particular, but these are clearly hard times for nearly everyone and we need to help support our local traders.  We don&#8217;t want St Margarets to become a shopping ghost town.  Just look at Church Street in Twickenham, nearly a third of all shops are gone!</p>

<p>If you can, please try and use the shops in our community when you can and keep St Margarets alive and healthy.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2009/03/grow_your_own_at_the_st_margarets_fair.html">Grow Your Own at the St Margarets Fair?</a></h3>

<p><img alt="SMFLogo180.jpg" src="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/SMFLogo180-thumb.jpg" width="150" height="150"  align="right"  /></p>

<p>As in previous years the serious planning for this year&#8217;s Fair began in January.  Saturday the 11<sup>th</sup> of July is the date for the Fair, and as always Moormead recreation ground is the venue.  To mark the 30<sup>th</sup> Fair last year there were some changes, notably the improvements to the toilet facilities and the reduction in the prices for the fairground rides.  This year we&#8217;re also moving the stage further away from the tea tent to help separate the &#8216;rock&#8217; from the rolls.   The Committee have always viewed the Fair primarily as a community event and whilst any profit we make supports local charities and schools, our over riding objective is to continue to provide an enjoyable community day every July for the whole population of St Margarets.  This year we&#8217;re considering an ambitious new attraction.  Whether you grow flowers, plants, vegetables or fruit, we thought you might like to exhibit your produce - and if you wanted to, enter it for judging.  If enough of you are interested then we&#8217;ll see if we can organise it.</p>

<p>Could you please let us know either by responding on this website or going to <a href="http://www.stmargaretsfair.org/">www.stmargaretsfair.org</a> and clicking on the contact us balloon, that will then enable you to send us your thoughts about this or anything else to do with the Fair.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2009/03/pocahontas_the_powhatan_princess_of_old_brentford.html">Pocahontas - The Powhatan Princess of Old Brentford</a></h3>

<p><img src="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/assets/images/2009/pocahontas-thumb.jpg" width="116" height="150" alt="Pocahontas"  align="right" style="padding: 2px; border: 1px solid #ccc;" /></p>


<p>She may be a much loved film star now but during her lifetime Pocahontas was not short of insult, upset and injury. She died pitifully young, her real name has been forgotten, her most famous exploit is probably a fiction, she was taken hostage, she was ignored by a king &#8212; and she lived in Brentford!</p>

<p>Pocahontas was born around 1595 in present day Virginia, the daughter of Wahunsunacock, the Chief of the Powhatan tribe.  Her given name was Mataoaka but because of her wilful nature she was called Pocahontas, which means &Ograve;wanton one&Oacute; in the Powhatan language. Legend says that one of her favourite activities as a child was to turn cartwheels in the street &#8212; stark naked!</p>

<p>The first English colonists arrived in Virginia in May 1607 when Pocahontas was about 13 years old. John Smith, a  leader of the group recounted that he was captured by Powhatan hunters. According to Smith, he was laid across a stone and was about to be beaten to death with clubs when Pocahontas threw herself across his body:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Pocahontas, the Kings dearest daughter, when no entreaty could prevaile, got his head in her armes, and laid her owne upon his to save him from death&#8221;.</p></blockquote>

This recipe is a variation of huevos rancheros which is a popular breakfast in Mexico  meaning &#8220;eggs ranch-style&#8221; or &#8220;eggs country-style&#8221;. The dish traditionally was served for on rural farms for a mid-day meal and is traditionally made with corn tortillas, vegetables and eggs. too make this meal slightly more European I have replaced the tortillas with polenta and added large quantities of vegetables to make a wonder healthy brunch.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2009/03/new_batfriendly_lights_proposed_for_the_warren_foo.html">New Bat-Friendly Lights Proposed for the Warren Footpath</a></h3>

<p><img src="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/assets/images/2009/bats_thames-thumb.jpg" width="150" height="112" alt="photo from BATS IN THE BOROUGH 2008 - http://www.richenvironmentnet.org.uk/Bats.aspx"  align="right" style="padding: 2px; border: 1px solid #ccc;" /></p>

<p>The Warren Footpath, which runs by the river from Richmond Bridge to Orleans Road, is a very important habitat for bats. There are 17 species of bat in the <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">UK,</span></span></span> 8 of which have been recorded in Richmond upon Thames. Bats have adapted to avoid predation by being nocturnal; they avoid lit areas and most will not fly into areas of light. Some species will not emerge from their roosts until light levels are low enough. The Ham Reach of the Thames by the Warren Footpath is known as a critical habitat for bats [they roost in the Park and feed along the river].</p>

<p><a href="http://www.biffaward.org/about">Biffaward</a> and the <a href="http://www.hlf.org.uk/english">Heritage Lottery Fund</a> are proposing to fund either the removal or upgrade of the lighting along the towpath. This is primarily to improve the area for bats, but also provides the opportunity to improve the lighting generally. The new lighting will be using <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">LED</span></span></span>s (light emitting diodes) which will reduce light pollution, improve visibility, have a longer lifespan and reduce energy consumption. A usage study has shown that the path is virtually unused by humans between 2300 and 0500 hours.</p>

<p>London&#8217;s Arcadia are therefore consulting on three possible lighting options:</p>


<ul>
<li>Option One - leave the lights as they are</li>
<li>Option Two - remove all the street lights and do not replace</li>
<li>Option Three - install new lighting</li>
</ul>



<p>You view an example of the proposed <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">LED </span></span></span>lighting and column between light columns 009 and 010 at the Richmond Bridge end of the Warren Footpath near Cambridge Gardens. The lights can be turned off or dimmed down during less busy times of the night and Intelligent Lighting Technology will be used to turn the lights on through human movement. The lights will be sensitive enough not to be triggered by weather, movement of vegetation or wildlife.</p>

<p>Consultation documents are available from: The Civic Centre reception in Twickenham, and Richmond Reference Library; or as <a href="http://bit.ly/oMpW6">downloads here</a> All comments on the proposed works must be received by 5 pm, 9<sup>th</sup> April 2009.</p>

<p>MP Vince Cable has demanded talks with Thames Water amid claims people living in St Margarets, Whitton and parts of Twickenham were not consulted over the expansion of Mogden sewage works.</p>

<p>The utilities giant&#8217;s application to expand the Isleworth plant by almost half was given the green light by Hounslow Council&#8217;s sustainable development committee on March 4.</p>

<p>But those living down wind of the infamous &#8216;pong&#8217; say they did not have a chance to air their views before the meeting.</p>
