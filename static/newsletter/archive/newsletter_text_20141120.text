----------------------------------------------------------------------

    "We originals are still the greatest!"

      DOBIE GRAY "The In Crowd"


    "There will be moments in your life when you suddenly realise that
     you have taken another step towards the departure lounge."

      KELVIN HENDRIE - a friend

    In 1964 I was a Mod. I wore a two-vent madras cotton jacket over an
    arrow point Ben Sherman shirt, hipster trousers and shoes by Ravel.
    My hair was backcombed and I rode a Lambretta Li150 scooter
    with chrome side panels. My music was soul and my attitudes were
    hip. I truly thought that I was one of the "In Crowd".

CONSULTATION: LIBRARIES WI-FI FEEDBACK SURVEY
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    A free Wi-Fi service was introduced in Richmond borough libraries
    early in 2014.

    feedback from library users, gauge satisfaction with the Wi-Fi
    service and alert them to any issues they need to address for
    the future.

    If you use Richmond upon Thames libraries please complete the short
    survey before 7 December 2014.

    and children at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital.

EVENT REMINDER: MINDFULNESS TASTER SESSION - 8 DECEMBER 2014
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Space to Be will be hosting a mindfulness taster session
    from 7:30-9:00pm on Monday, 8 December 2014 at the Emmanuel Centre,
    the new hall at the back of St James Catholic Church in Twickenham.
    The cost of the taster is 5 and booking is essential. pounds

    Mindfulness is a practice which involves deliberately bringing your
    awareness to the present moment with acceptance and non-judgement.
    Research suggests that meditation and awareness training can boost
    the immune system, significantly reduce stress, improve sleep,
    bolster creativity, reduce the ruminative thinking that leads
    to anxiety and depression and improve relationships with loved ones
    and friends.
