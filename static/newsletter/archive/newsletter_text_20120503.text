ï»¿RICHMOND PARK - STARFISH BOMBING DECOY SF8A
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    "I think it is well also for the man in the street to realise that
     there is no power on earth that can protect him from being bombed.
     Whatever people may tell him, the bomber will always get through."

      STANLEY BALDWIN 9th November 1932

    In the 1930's there was a general and well founded fear of aerial
    attack by enemy aircraft. Bombers had long replaced the battleship
    as the ultimate weapon of war as Churchill himself noted... "Bombers
    alone provide the means of victory."

    It was against this alarming vision of German bombs tumbling
    nonstop from the sky that in 1939, at the very beginning of WW 2,
    the Air Ministry set up a special unit to build decoy cities, towns
    and airfields as a way of drawing the bombs of the Luftwaffe. In
    charge of the project was civil engineer and pilot Colonel John
    Turner, (later Sir John Turner). Recognising the need for people
    with experience of creating fake buildings and streets Colonel
    Turner established his headquarters at Sound City Film Studios
    in Shepperton where realistic film sets were the order of the day.
    The motto of 'Col. Turner's Department' as the unit was known was
    "Day and Night, Defend by Confusion."

NEW LOCAL SCHOOL FOR TWICKENHAM
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    A bid to open an 11-18 secondary free school in the Twickenham area
    has progressed to the next stage of the assessment process.

    The RET Twickenham Trust, which includes local parents and
    representatives of the Russell Education Trust (RET), will be
    interviewed by the Department for Education on Tuesday May 15th.
    They will discuss their vision for the New Local School
    for Twickenham, which, if approved, would welcome its first Year 7
    intake in September 2013.

    The New Local School for Twickenham steering group is proposing an
    innovative and inspirational community school, committed to the
    highest possible standards, delivering a broad and balanced
    curriculum and valuing the achievements and aspirations of
    every pupil.

BREAKING NEWS FROM THE ST MARGARETS TRADERS ASSOCIATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The rumours are true! You may have heard the the famous St
    Margarets Diamond has been found in time for The Queens Diamond
    Jubilee celebrations.

    The priceless diamond disappeared several hundred years ago. We are
    pleased to announce that the internationally famous diamond was
    recently discovered in a house clearance. The diamond will be going
    on display in St Margarets for all to admire. Our friends
    at Churchills Estate Agents in St Margarets Road St Margarets have
    kindly offered to host the exhibition. The uber expensive diamond
    will be on show for all to admire at Churchills office at 155 St
    Margarets Road St Margarets during their opening times. The hyper
    valuable diamond has pride of place in their window. Please see a
    special edition of the St Margarets Guardian for the full story.

PUB AND SHOP NEWS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    I hear from a reliable source - the doyen of the Richmond town pub
    trade - that both the Marble Hill (Rising Sun as was) and the Old
    Anchor have been bought from Young's by Sainsburys supermarket,
    with the intention, we must presume, of turning a one or both
    of them into mini supermarkets, perhaps of keeping the other out
    of the hands of a rival. No planning permission is required
    for this, I believe.

    A mini supermarket is also part of the scheme for the Ryde House
    site (391 Richmond Road 12/1001/FUL ) with the rest as a budget
    hotel. Bad news for East Twickenham's convenience stores, which are
    already too numerous for the custom to be had, but it may lead to a
    relaxation of the bar on opening restaurants in this 'protected
    shopping frontage', which is what many of the local proprietors
    have long yearned to do and are in fact already doing more or
    less covertly.

    Let us hope that Richmond Road will be allowed to become a rival
    to Kew Road as a centre for Richmond's restaurant trade: what could
    be pleasanter than to meet for a drink on the Riverside and then
    stroll across the bridge to dine in one of the newly fashionable
    East Twickenham eateries? We already have Acena acena.co.uk and
    Brula www.brula.co.uk : what we need is more of the same and
    soon, please.
