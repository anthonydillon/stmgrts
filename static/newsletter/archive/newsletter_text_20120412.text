ï»¿APRIL 14TH 1912 - 11.50PM - LAT. 41.46 N. LON 50.14 W - "STRUCK ICEBERG. SINKING FAST"
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    "There were no more boats, water was swirling around the upper
     deck, people were beginning to panic... and the band continued
     to play."

    -- HELEN CHURCHILL CANDEE - Titanic Survivor

    In Isleworth Cemetery, at a place where two paths meet, is a tall
    marble column erected as a memorial to the Pears family. On one
    panel is written...

                           In loving Memory of
                              Thomas Pears
          Fourth son of Andrew and Marianne Pearson Pears
                     Who was lost on the S.S Titanic
                              April 15th 1912
                               Aged 29 years

            "Until the day dawns and the shadows flee away."

LEGAL CHALLENGE TO NEW CATHOLIC SECONDARY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    In February, Richmond Inclusive Schools Campaign (RISC) pointed out
    to the Council that, under the new Education Act, a council that
    thinks it needs a new school must first seek proposals for an
    Academy/Free School, where there is a limit of 50% faith-based
    admissions. But the Council is continuing to support proposals for
    a Voluntary Aided Catholic secondary school on the Clifden Road
    site so that up to 100% of admissions can be faith-based. The
    Council's view is that the Act still enables them to do that. The
    issue will now be decided in a Judicial Review. The case is being
    brought jointly by RISC and the British Humanist Association (BHA).

    Statements on the legal challenge from RISC, the BHA, the Diocese
    and the Council.

TWICKENHAM FARMERS' MARKET PLANT FAIR - 14 APRIL 2012
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    It's that time of the year again! Twickenham Farmers' Market holds
    its annual Spring Plant Fair this Saturday - 14 April 2012!

    We have some great nurseries attending this year - let's hope we
    can squeeze them all in!

    We have Hampshire herbs from Stockbridge Herbs, Surrey herbs
    from the Culinary Herb Company, and fantastic-looking perennials
    from Pioneer Plants. For beautiful bulbs go to Rose Cottage Plants
    from Essex, or pay a visit to Ab of Beauchamp Nurseries, another
    South London growing business. Edible Ornamentals will be bringing
    their broad range of edible plants (with a string emphasis
    on chillies), and Test Valley Nursery will have an interesting mix
    of rare specialist plants alongside traditional "cottage garden"
    varieties. Market regulars Perry Court Farm will be bringing an
    extra range of fruit and veg seedling plants from their farm
    in Kent.

    We have no doubt Twickenham will be looking a much brighter, more
    vibrant place in the days and weeks to come.

    Enjoy the market and plant fair on Saturday,

    Twickenham Farmers' Market - every Saturday 9am to 1pm in Holly
    Road car park

MISSING TORTOISE - APRIL 2012 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    I was hoping that someone could help me finding my missing
    tortoise! 

    He goes by the name of Basil, not that that will be of much help,
    but he is greatly missed. It may be the case that he is taking a
    very long hibernation, but we have concerns that he may have
    escaped from his garden in South Western Road and been picked up
    by someone. Even if someone has had him for several weeks they will
    be thanked for looking after him, but we would very much like
    to have him back. Tortoises need to have special care.

    Small reward for anyone who finds him. He is a Hermans Tortoise,
    about 12 years old and would probably be about the same size as an
    adult male's hand.

    Please contact the website here if you have any information, or
    Basil himself.

LADY GAGA COMING TO TWICKENHAM - 8 SEPTEMBER 2012
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Lady Gaga today announced she will perform the "most spectacular
    show London has ever seen" and even plans to build a medieval
    castle on stage.

    The 26-year-old superstar said she has now outgrown the O2 arena
    as she announced her return to the capital for the first time in 18
    months with a huge outdoor concert at Twickenham Stadium.

    The singer promised a show of Biblical proportions that will see a
    huge, semi-circular walkway extending out onto the stadium floor. A
    Gothic-style castle featuring viewing towers and intricate carvings
    will be constructed.

    She said: "The Haus of Gaga and I have worked for months conceiving
    a spectacular stage. The Born This Way Ball is an Electro-Metal pop
    opera; the tale of the Beginning, the genesis of the Kingdom
    of Fame. How we were birthed and how we will die celebrating."

    The 55,000-capacity show on September 8 will be her first in London
    since 2010, when she sold 68,000 tickets during six nights at the
    O2. Her tour schedule allows for two extra nights to be added.

AIRLINE CALLS TO END HEATHROW NIGHT FLIGHT BAN
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Super-jumbos could be allowed to land at Heathrow for more than 20
    hours a day under plans being considered by ministers.

    Emirates Airline hopes to bypass restrictions on night flights
    by landing its A380 airbuses -- the world's largest passenger
    airliners -- at steeper angles to protect homes from jet-engine
    noise. The airline wants permission to fly in and out until 1am
    every day, restarting flights after 4am.

MICHAEL GOVE CALLS FOR FAITH PUPIL LIMIT IN TWICKENHAM SCHOOL
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Education Secretary Michael Gove has suggested a proposed new
    Catholic school should limit Catholic pupils to 50% of its intake.

    Business Secretary Vince Cable wrote to Mr Gove about the proposed
    school, which is in his Twickenham constituency.

    Mr Gove said the proposal for a cap was "very sensible".

    But a Catholic Education Service official said turning Catholics
    away and admitting others just because they were not Catholic would
    be "odd".
