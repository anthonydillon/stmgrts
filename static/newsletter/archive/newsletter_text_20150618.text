ï»¿FAREWELL MARGUERITE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Marguerite Patten, Food Economist.
    Born November 4th 1915. Died June 4th 2015. She was 99 years old.

    I come from a generation who were raised on Marguerite Patten's
    wartime recipes. Her meals were shaped - as we were - by food
    rationing, shortages and some unusual additions to our diet
    like dried egg, spam, whale steaks and that ghastly canned fish -
    snoek. We are the generation that still remembers, not always
    fondly, tripe and trotters, scrag end and sago and worse of all -
    tapioca known as "frog spawn " by the millions of kids obliged
    to eat it
