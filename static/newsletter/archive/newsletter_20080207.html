<p><em>7 February 2008</em></p>

<p>Welcome to the St Margarets Community Website Newsletter (<a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk">www.stmgrts.org.uk</a>). Each Thursday we will send you the latest news and events from the website.</p>

<div id="special">

<h2>Letter from the editor</h2>

<p>For the past few months you many have noticed a fairly reduced number of articles, events and newsletters coming from the site.  If you emailed, you may have not received nice, timely replies.  I thought I should both apologise and explain.</p>

<p>The reason is simple.  When I started the site, it was I was between jobs and had a fair bit of time and also the enthusiasm and help of several very active supporters.  Over time all of us have been pulled into other things.  In the past year, my job has become more and more demanding on my time.  Sadly a few things have had to slip in importance (you should see the allotment).</p>

<p>I currently have no intention of stopping the site, but would ask three things:</p>


<ol>
<li>please excuse the occasional missed newsletter or slow email replies, remember, this is a labour of love, no revenue is generated by the site</li>
<li>if you have any ideas on content for the site please contact me.</li>
<li>if anyone would like to help with the site, particularly with adding events, please get in touch.</li>
</ol>



<p>Peter<br />

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2008/02/pictures_for_frances.html">Pictures for Frances?</a></h3>

<p>About a year ago, we received a letter from the daughter of a former St Margarets&#8217; resident who has longed to return to the UK since 1946.  At the time she was looking for help on getting a flight arranged for her mother to visit, but now writes asking for photos and news.  If any reader knows Frances and can relate some stories, or a photographers with a good set of photos of the area, please email us at <a href="mailto:%63%6F%6E%74%65%6E%74%40%73%74%6D%67%72%74%73%2E%6F%72%67%2E%75%6B">content@stmgrts.org.uk</a> and we will arrange to email off the information.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2008/02/teddington_cpz_an_unrepresentative_minority_wants.html">Teddington <span class="caps">CPZ</span>: An Unrepresentative Minority wants a <span class="caps">CPZ</span></a></h3>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;I thought you might be interested in my analysis of the Council&#8217;s survey in Teddington.  The issues are very similar &#8212; the worst parking problem occurs in the evening &#8212; and yet the Council wishes to force through a <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">CPZ </span></span></span>on a small positive vote (completely ignoring those who didn&#8217;t vote for whatever reason) of a relatively small section of the area (they asked half the households in Teddington for their views).</p>

<p>Parking in St Margarets is a pain and will remain a pain regardless of whether a <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">CPZ </span></span></span>is implemented.  A <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">CPZ </span></span></span>will cost everyone money, will bring traffic wardens into the area on a regular basis (perhaps their contract could extend to something socially useful, like litter picking) and will reduce the amount of parking since parking at junctions will be controlled.  Only those who haven&#8217;t thought about the big picture could possibly favour any <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">CPZ </span></span></span>scheme.&#8221;</p>

<p><cite>&#8212; former Cllr Simon Lamb</cite></p></blockquote>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2008/02/orange_tree_theatre_arts_council_grant_reinstated.html">Orange Tree Theatre Arts Council Grant Reinstated</a></h3>

<p>The Orange Tree Theatre is delighted to announce that its Arts Council grant has been reinstated, having been under the threat of a 17 % cut. This decision is a reflection of the Arts Council&#8217;s belief in the quality and importance of the Orange Tree&#8217;s work and recognition of its significant London-wide reputation. The Orange Tree is London&#8217;s only theatre permanent theatre in the round and its commitment to unearthing forgotten classics gives it a national significance.  Without full funding the Orange Tree would be unable to continue with its unique programme of work as well as its many education and outreach projects, and so it is with relief that we learn that the Arts Councils&#8217; full support will continue.</p>
