ST MARGARETS TO SEND MEDICAL TEAM TO HELP ROMANIAN CHILDREN
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    A group of St Margarets� families has recently become involved
    with a UK charity working in Romania. FRODO (Foundation for the
    Relief of Disabled Orphans), accesses urgent medical treatment 
    for disabled children who have been orphaned or abandoned and
    are last in the line for healthcare. Romania remains the country 
    with the highest incidence of abandoned children anywhere 
    in the world - there are hundreds of children without decent 
    medical care.
    
    Set up by Robin Nydes, an investment banker, the charity is
    appealingly small and dynamic. With a core staff of only four
    it has helped over 150 children directly since it was started
    two years ago.
    
    A Treatment & Training programme where senior consultants
    from Great Ormond Street give up two weeks of their time to work 
    with Romanian medical specialists in their hospitals will see 
    100 children and operate on around 25.  These efforts, given 
    freely, will transform the lives of these children.
    
    Our ambition is to set up a St Margaret�s community initiative
    to sponsor one of FRODO�s Treatment & Training programmes. It 
    costs �25,000 to directly help 25 children to a new life and 
    to support a further 75.

FITNESS TIPS AND CLASS TIMES FROM GEOLIFESTYLE - NO. 4
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    How to beat your exercising excuses.
    
    1. Make sure you warm up well. Begin your warm by walking 
       for 2 minutes and then start jogging. Run easily for about 
       5 minutes. Taking walking breaks when you need them.
    
    2. Keep your pace slow. Do not run too quickly as this will
       make the session hard.
    
    3. Run somewhere new so you do not get bored of your running route.
    
    4. Try running some of the free 5K time trial runs in the local
       parks. These are great fun and provide a good monitor as 
       to how your training is working out.
    
    5. Have a go at a new exercise class. Do a workout that you 
       have not done before. This will keep you motivated and help 
       supplement your training.
    
    6. Start to run using a heart rate monitor. This will provide
       a good indicator to how hard you are training
       and your progression.

PLANNING REFUSED FOR 66 CROWN ROAD
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    At the planning committee meeting on the 15th of May the 
    application to turn the former doctors surgery at 66 Crown Road 
    into 2 two bed flats, 1 one bed flat and a studio flat was refused.
    This was despite the planning officer having recommended that 
    the proposal be granted.  Forty residents had registered individual
    objections to the proposed plan which initially included 
    a suggestion that the development would take the doctors parking
    bay and use it for their own personal use. This was then amended
    with a suggestion that the number of parking permits would be 
    legally restricted to two permits from that address. The committee
    was concerned at the amount of flats being proposed 
    in the development which would not even have left room 
    for sufficient space for bicycle parking for all the householders.
    
    Local ward councillor Phillip Morgan spoke on behalf of the
    residents concerns and said afterwards that he was very pleased
    with the result which shows that �democracy does work and 
    councillors do take account of local residents views. It was very
    unusual to have 40 individual objections and showed a high level
    of public concern about the proposal.� It is now up to the 
    developer whether or not they wish to appeal or to try again
    with new plans. Hopefully they will want to be more considerate
    of their neighbours with any future plans.
