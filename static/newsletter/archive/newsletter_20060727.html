<p><em>27 July 2006</em></p>

<p>Welcome to the St Margarets Community Website Newsletter (<a href="https://stmargarets.london">stmargarets.london</a>).  Each Thursday we will send you the latest news and events from the website.</p>

<h2>Latest News</h2>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2006/07/meeting_notes_p.html">Meeting Notes : Police Liaison Meeting from 19 July</a></h3>

<p>Sgt Arif Malik, PC Alan Richens, PCSO Lucy Burt and PCSO Eugenia Venour met with some 25 local residents to discuss implementation of the Safer Neighbourhoods initiative. Wendy Kyle-Pope, the borough liaison between police and wards, whose remit is to improve communications, chaired the meeting. Future meetings will be chaired by Dr Jenny Atton, who also chairs the Cole Park Road Residents Association.</p>

<p>The Safer Neighbourhood Team consists of six police and police community support officers, whose aim is to address the community&#8217;s key concerns. The meeting was set up to define these concerns, seek understanding of the background to them from residents, and discuss the most practical ways of tackling them.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2006/07/brunnel_site_ne.html">Brunnel Site : New Octagon Planning Proposal</a></h3>

<p>Octagon, the developers of the Brunnel Site have submitted a planning proposal to remove the 18th century water feature in front of Gordon House and replacing it with two small ponds, a road and a large paved area.  The paved area appears to be for parking, instead of the previously planned and obviously more expensive underground parking.</p>

<p>Many local resident groups are opposing this application.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2006/07/holiday_multisp.html">Holiday Multi-Sports Camp at Moormead</a></h3>

<p>Richmond Council is running a <a href="http://www.richmond.gov.uk/liveitup">series of sports camps</a> around the borough, a few are being run at Moormead.  Children aged between 8 and 14 years can take part. Sports included are tennis, swimming, softball, football, cricket, basketball, trampolining, gymnastics and golf.  The emphasis of the camps is on fun but all sports will include some element of coaching, with the exception of swimming which is purely a fun session.  All sports are suitable for both boys and girls.  All camps run from 10.00am - 3.00pm. </p>

<p>The courses at Moormead are:</p>

<p>Football only </p>


<ul>
<li>Football only &#8212; Mon 24 Jul - Fri 28 Jul</li>
<li>Football only &#8212; Mon 7 Aug - Fri 11 Aug</li>
<li>Tennis, football and softball &#8212; Mon 21 Aug - Fri 25 Aug</li>
</ul>



<p>Apparently 2 more children are needed to ensure the football camp runs, so call 020 8831 6107 or e-mail <a href="mailto:%6C%65%69%73%75%72%65%40%72%69%63%68%6D%6F%6E%64%2E%67%6F%76%2E%75%6B">leisure@richmond.gov.uk</a> today.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2006/07/tesco_comments.html">Tesco Comments on Changes to Deliveries</a></h3>

<p>Councillor Ben Khosa has been in contact with Tesco regarding their deliveries to the St Margarets Road Tesco Express to understand and see if there could be further adjustments.  The following was the Tesco response:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;We have reduced the size of the delivery vehicles we use.</p>

<p>We originally used 16.5 metre vehicles - which are full size. </p>

<p>We now deliver fresh food every morning on a 10 metre rigid.  Occasionally if volumes are great we would use an artic with a 14 metre trailer.  I would stress this is not a regular occurence, but is still smaller than the original vehicle used.</p>

<p>The grocery delivery which happens on Monday - Saturday afternoons is done from a small box van, again unless there is a huge spike in volumes when we would then move to a 10ft rigid vehicle for this.</p>

<p>We did look at consolidating the deliveries further but due to volumes of goods involved it was not possible.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
