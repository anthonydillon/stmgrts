ï»¿30TH JANUARY - DINNER AT THE CALVES HEAD CLUB
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    "A meal is made by the company you keep - so be careful who you
     dine with!"

    When despots fall and regimes crumble it often results in unease
    amongst the populace. There will be some - Group A, who are happy
    to welcome the new system with the optimistic hope that it will
    lead to better times. There will be others - Group B, who will
    mourn the passing of the old arrangement but do it rather quietly
    fearing an adverse reaction from Group A. There will be Group C
    whose lives, brief and brutish, will remain unchanged - and there
    will be group D who will celebrate the change in circumstances
    loudly with a slap up meal.

RICHMOND MAY FAIR BALL 2012
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Friday 11 May, The Green, Richmond

    Over 200 eager Ball fans have already reserved their tickets for
    the Richmond May Fair Ball, which takes place on Friday 11 May in a
    beautiful marquee on Richmond Green.

    In this, its 19th thriving year, the Ball proceeds will be shared
    between two highly deserving local charities. SPEAR is working
    with homeless and vulnerable people in and around Richmond,
    successfully transforming lives while operating a hostel, an
    outreach team, a tenancy support service, and a young persons'
    project, with a team also working with people who have drug and
    alcohol problems. The second beneficiary, Richmond's very own
    renowned Orange Tree Theatre, provides an exceptional variety
    of workshops and quality productions throughout the year
    for children both from the Borough and across the country. On
    average, every year nearly 15,000 young and elderly people benefit
    from the theatre's exciting Community and Education programme.

    Tickets are strictly limited and cost 125 pounds per person including a
    generous Champagne Reception, gourmet four course dinner with wine
    and dancing to a live band.

GOVERNOR VACANCY FOR ORLEANS INFANTS SCHOOL
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Orleans Infants School has a vacancy for a Local Authority
    Governor. Governors are vital to the running of the school and it
    is exciting being involved in new developments and helping the
    school improve and meet its targets. Having been judged outstanding
    by Ofsted the school is striving to maintain these high standards
    and continue to improve while ensuring the successful transition
    to a 2 form entry primary school. Governors need to have the time
    to commit to full governors meetings, committee meetings and other
    tasks, at least some of which take place during school hours.
    Skills in strategic planning, analysing data and human resources
    are always useful, but most of all we need someone who is
    passionate about school improvement. Please note that Local
    Authority governors should not be parents or staff of the school.

    If you are interested, please contact the school office on 020 8892
    1654 or governors@orleans.richmond.sch.uk

RICHMOND COUNCIL APPROVES EXPANSION OF ORLEANS AND ST STEPHENS SCHOOLS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The January 26 Council Cabinet meeting decided to go ahead with the
    'Expansion Of Orleans Infant And Nursery School And St Stephen's
    Church Of England Junior School'.

    '... The proposals are that, in September 2012, Orleans Infant would
    be converted from a three-form entry infant school to a two-form
    entry primary and St Stephen's Junior would be converted from a
    three-form entry junior to a two- form entry primary. Both schools
    would therefore provide statutory education of children in all
    year-groups from Reception to Year 6 inclusive. The proposals
    would create:

    - a fourth Reception class across the two schools and a seventh
      within the local area, enabling an extra 30 children to be admitted
      into Reception each year;
    - a third school - St Stephen's - with a reception intake in the
      area; and
    - a third geographical entry-point for Reception in the area . . '


    The responses include one from the governors of Governing Body
    of Orleans Infants setting out their position in detail.
