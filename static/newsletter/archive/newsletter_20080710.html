<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2008/07/operation_krazy_kitchen.html">Operation Krazy Kitchen</a></h3>

<p>Have you ever wondered what it takes to organise a really big event like the Glastonbury Festival or Trooping the Colour? For a small taste of what is required you should get involved with the St. Margarets Fair.  Although Jay-Z or Her Majesty are probably not going to put in an appearance,  the complexity of the event and the myriad things that have to be attended to are similar  - from the most fundamental health, safety, security and insurance issues to the niggling concern that there won&#8217;t be enough sticky tape to hold up signs. Whatever it is, big or small, someone, somewhere has to think about it - and then make it happen.</p>

<p>Take the &#8216;Krazy Kitchen&#8217; sideshow run by the 1st St Margarets Scout Group. On the face of it this is simplicity itself:- enthusiastic fans (exhibit 1) throw wooden balls (exhibit 2) at old crockery (exhibit 3) piled on a table (exhibit 4) However, and maybe surprisingly, Krazy Kitchen calls for the same attention to detail as the Apollo Moon Landings. First - and months before the event - a search is made in every charity shop in the district for unwanted crockery. Once located Transport Section then swings into action to collect aforementioned china and move it to the Scout Store - a top-secret installation somewhere in the Home Counties a.k.a Whitton.  Then Health and Safety join the fun by raising the possibility that wooden balls (Exhibit 2) thrown by overly refreshed and excitable young people (Exhibit 1) might be dangerous. They suggest that we surround the Krazy Kitchen Kompound with safety nets and screens. Before retiring to their luxury penthouse in Whitehall they also point out that broken crockery (Exhibit 3) can be sharp and recommend that everyone involves wears safety gloves&#8230; apart from the young fans of things flung who make up Exhibit 1. (see prior)</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2008/07/leeches_filthy_little_devils.html">Leeches? Filthy Little Devils!</a></h3>

<p><img src="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/assets/images/2008/rivercrane_boys-thumb.jpg" width="99" height="150" alt="boys helping"  align="right" style="padding: 2px; border: 1px solid #ccc;" /></p>

<p>We all think that the River Crane is pretty marvellous - but there are some in our community who believe its waters to be positively miraculous with the power to dissolve supermarket trolleys and old fridges, turn discarded plastic bottles into elegant holiday homes for garden gnomes and transport garden waste to Patagonia where it becomes a luxury food item for endangered penguins.  That is why they so confidently use our river as a rubbish bin. This is also why the Tidal Crane Association was formed some 25 years ago &#8212; to clear up the rubbish and to keep the lower Crane beautiful, safe and navigable.</p>

<p>River Clearing Day was last weekend. With the help of Thames 21, an environmental group dedicated to the maintenance of London&#8217;s small rivers and creeks, some 50 people from the <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">T.C.A </span></span></span>in north St Margarets pulled on waders and work gloves and, inspired by the rumour that Humphrey Bogart had filmed in the Crane for his movie <em>African Queen</em> (he hadn&#8217;t) and his widow Lauren Bacall had explored the river herself in a small boat (she had!), plunged in, risking whiffy mud, leeches (yes, there are leeches in the Crane) and the possibility of Death by Drowning!  Yikes!</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2008/07/st_margaret_who.html">St Margaret Who?</a></h3>

<p><img src="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/assets/images/2008/stmargaret_statue-thumb.jpg" width="99" height="150" alt="status of st margaret"  align="right" style="padding: 2px; border: 1px solid #ccc;" /></p>

<p>I went to see St Margaret yesterday &#8212; but the poor soul wasn&#8217;t looking her best. A hundred years of nights out on the tiles has left our local Saint looking pitted and windblown&#8230; but that&#8217;s what happens when you&#8217;re a stone statue!</p>

<p>Margaret once stood on the top of an archway at All Souls Church in Northcote Road, looking out over the parish and the community that bears her name. She was taken down fairly recently when it looked like she might plunge to the ground and dispatch the next passing parishioner. Now she lies fallen but not forgotten in a corner of All Souls Church garden - a young woman wearing a hooded dress and holding a large sword shaped like a cross.</p>
