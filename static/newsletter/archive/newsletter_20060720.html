<p><em>20 July 2006</em></p>

<p>Welcome to the St Margarets Community Website Newsletter (<a href="https://stmargarets.london">stmargarets.london</a>).  Each Thursday we will send you the latest news and events from the website.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2006/07/tesco_comments.html">Tesco Comments on Changes to Deliveries</a></h3>

<p>Councillor Ben Khosa has been in contact with Tesco regarding their deliveries to the St Margarets Road Tesco Express to understand and see if there could be further adjustments.  The following was the Tesco response:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;We have reduced the size of the delivery vehicles we use.</p>

<p>We originally used 16.5 metre vehicles - which are full size. </p>

<p>We now deliver fresh food every morning on a 10 metre rigid.  Occasionally if volumes are great we would use an artic with a 14 metre trailer.  I would stress this is not a regular occurence, but is still smaller than the original vehicle used.</p>

<p>The grocery delivery which happens on Monday - Saturday afternoons is done from a small box van, again unless there is a huge spike in volumes when we would then move to a 10ft rigid vehicle for this.</p>

<p>We did look at consolidating the deliveries further but due to volumes of goods involved it was not possible.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2006/07/moormead_park_v.html">Moormead Park Vandalised</a></h3>

<p>Sadly, only a day after the <em>St Margarets Fair</em>, which officially opened the new Moormead Park Playground and raised thousands for the ongoing restoration of the park&#8217;s pavilion, it was nearly destroyed.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;A gang of rowdy youths were causing a disruption at approximately 11pm on Sunday 16 July in the newly refurbished playground. They were hurling the metal barriers about and clearly intent on causing damage.  They proceeded to the skips where they removed refuse to hurl at the pavilion walls.  Finally they trashed the new planters with flowers that had only been placed there that morning, less than 12 hours before.  The police were called but the youths scattered before they arrived.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
