LATEST NEWS
===========================================================



TONY BLAIR IS SHOCKED - AND SO ARE WE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    This is the third dispatch from Gill Swain, a local writer who has
    traveled to Palestine to work for peace with the World Council
    of Churches.

    It's been widely reported this week that Tony Blair was thoroughly
    shocked when he learned the full truth about the enormous numbers
    of barriers, obstacles and settlements that the Israeli government
    has constructed within the West Bank during its 40 years 
    of occupation.
    
    We had already heard about his reaction to the UN briefing he was
    given when he took up his new job as Middle East peace envoy. He 
    came to Hebron for another briefing last week - we caught a 
    glimpse of him arriving at the municipal office - and we were
    told afterwards that he was shocked all over again by the dire 
    situation here.
    
    You might think it strange that a former prime minister should 
    be so taken aback by the realities of a problem he has been 
    concerned with in some way  for over a decade. But I can 
    understand it because our group had the same UN briefing 
    in Jerusalem, and we were really shocked too.

EVENT REMINDER: ART AUCTION
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    It's November, so it must be the Art Auction
    
    Once again the Environment Trust for Richmond upon Thames has the 
    borough's art lovers in its sights, hoping to boost its charitable 
    coffers at the very popular annual Art Auction. Once again many
    big-name artists have generously responded to the call 
    for contributions -- and it's the big names that attract the 
    big spenders. Royal Academicians Mary Fedden, Chris Orr and 
    Bernard Dunstan have all given pictures. But often connoisseurs
    find a local artist to invest in too, and the auction will have
    plenty of pictures from borough-based professionals and amateurs 
    with a strong local following.
    
    The Trust's fund-raising this year is focusing on its ambitious
    River Centre project for Twickenham, a new community building 
    with Sir David Attenborough as Patron. This will be a learning 
    centre for sustainability and a focus for environmental 
    volunteering, and will provide opportunities for river-based 
    crafts such as boat-building and repair.
    
    The Auction is on Thursday November 8th, at York House, 
    Twickenham. Viewing starts at 7pm, the auction begins at 
    8pm, and tickets are L5 (to include a glass of wine and 
    canapes) from the Environment Trust on 020 8891 5455, or
    email office@environmenttrust.co.uk
    
    You can have a preview of the pictures available by going 
    to the Trust's website,
