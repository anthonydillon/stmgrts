THE VICAR OF ISLEWORTH
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Hands up everybody who is really excited about the current
    elections! Oh, the fun of it all. Local and European! Home and
    Away! The endless blethering, the armies of campaigners banging
    on the door, the piles of promises yet to be broken heaping up
    on the door mat and the myriad of prospective politicians demanding
    our attention and our vote. Labour, Conservative, Lib Dem, Green,
    UKIP, Independent, UUP, British Democrats, Sinn Fein, Scottish
    Nationalist, We Demand a Referendum, Plaid Cymru and on and on...
    all the sign of a healthy if rather overheated democracy.

    It was not like this in 1639. There were only two political
    alliances then - the Royalists on one side and the Puritans on the
    other and they didn't get on - and stuck in the middle was the
    Reverend William Grant, Vicar of Isleworth.

    celebrations marking the beginning of this important era, the
    museum is organising the following talk:

    "Phippy" Jonathan Wathen Phipps/Waller - Eye surgeon to George III,
    Groom of the Bedchamber to William IV

    A talk by Ruth Hayward, 7.30pm Monday 2 June 2014 at The Parish
    Church of St Mary Magdalene, Paradise Road, Richmond.

    "The Museum of Richmond is especially delighted to be able
    to participate in the nationwide events to celebrate the Georgian
    period" says the Curator Natascha Wintersinger, "The talk by Ruth
    Hayward, author of "Phippy" promises to be fascinating!"
