ï»¿IAN MCLAGAN... FROM ISLEWORTH
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Our neck of the West London woods has a proud reputation
    for originating, nurturing and cherishing popular music and those
    that play it, from international stars like Mick Jagger and Pete
    Townshend to amateur bluespickers noodling away in their back
    bedroom. Sadly on the 3rd December one of that august company died.

    Ian McLagan was 69 years old. For fans of the popular music of the
    1960's and 70's he is best known as the keyboard player with the
    "Small Faces" and the "Faces". Later in his career he worked as a
    session player with such stars as Chuck Berry, Bob Dylan, Bruce
    Springsteen and Rod Stewart.

YOGA FITNESS STARTS THE NEW YEAR WITH TWO NEW CLASSES
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    5 good reasons to start 'Complete Beginners' yoga in 2015

    If you are interested in trying out yoga, but are intimidated by
    the thought of exotic bends and legs wrapped behind heads, then
    read on...

    The most wonderful thing about yoga is that 'Yoga is for everyone',
    virtually anyone can practice it, with a modified practice to suit
    you. Forget visions of Cirque du Soleil type students bending
    around in your local community hall, yoga is for people of all
    shapes, sizes, ages and abilities.
