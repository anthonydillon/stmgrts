CPZ: BEAT FIGURES
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Richmond Borough Council conducted a 'Beat' survey as a guide to
    determine what if any parking problems exist in an area. This is
    done by comparing car registration plates at different times of
    the day. The 4.30am figure would indicate the total number of
    residents parked, whilst the day time figures would represent a
    mix of residents and visitors.
    
    Survey conducted Tuesday Nov 2007
    
    Street	4.30a.m.	10a.m.	4.30p.m.
			
    Sidney Rd			67	56	60
    Winchester			104	86	83
    Bridge Rd			30	28	27
    South Western		72	53	55
    Godstone Rd			71	68	66
    Kenley Rd			74	66	66
    Hill View Rd		41	48	31
    Moor Mead Rd		70	61	64
    Chertsey Rd			29	31	30
    Brook Rd			30	25	26
    St Margarets Grove	91	81	81
    (Broadway Av)		47	28	32
		 	
    Total:				726	631	621
    
    From the  Beat survey you can see that there are approximately
    100 fewer cars parked during the day than at night.
    
    Other facts
    
    * A CPZ means that legally, yellow lines have to be put 
      in place resulting in loss of spaces.
    
    * The 60 Grove flats which have onsight parking for about 
      20 cars, were excluded from parking on Winchester Rd but were
      included in the 2nd consultation. 
    
    * If you can't change to a "green" car, you could pay up 
      to 225 pound pa, plus 337.50 pounds pa for a second car
      = 562.50 pounds pa.
    
    * You have to pay for vouchers for your visitors and tradesmen.
      Parking fines for even minor contraventions 80 pounds and due
      to change from 1st July.
    
    * Creating bays across dropped kerbs is a possibility. The Council 
      cannot remove unauthorised vehicles.

THE RISE AND FALL OF THE DIDDLERS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The first trolley bus in London pulled out of Fulwell depot,
    Teddington on May 16th 1931 opening the No. 4 route between
    Teddington and Twickenham. As it left the depot the District
    Inspector Charles Gilbert jumped aboard and paid 1 penny for the
    first ticket. The conductor was Charles Hadland and you can see
    him in the YouTube film selling tickets to passengers on the top
    deck. Mr Hadland was noted for his smart appearance... 
    
      "I used to be a shining example in those days... I spent
       two hours every day cleaning my uniform and had cuffs
       gleaming like patent leather and buttons twinkling 
       like stars."
