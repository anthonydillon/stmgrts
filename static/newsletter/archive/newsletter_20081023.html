<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2008/10/richmond_celebrates_london_the_fairtrade_capital_o.html">Richmond Celebrates London &#8212; The Fairtrade Capital of the World</a></h3>

<p><img src="https://stmargarets.london/assets/images/2008/fairtrade_richmond-thumb.jpg" width="150" height="112" alt="Richmond upon Thames Fairtrade Steering Group Chair Maria Longley, Leader of the Richmond upon Thames Council  Cllr Serge Lourie, Ann Peterken and Jenny Atton, both members of the Fairtrade Steering Group"  align="right" style="padding: 2px; border: 1px solid #ccc;" /></p>

<p>From Thursday 23 October 2008, Londoners will have more choice than ever before when it comes to selecting Fairtrade in the nation&#8217;s capital, as London becomes the world&#8217;s largest Fairtrade City. Hundreds of businesses have signed up to the campaign, meaning that Londoners will never again have to go very far to buy the Fairtrade products they want.</p>

<p>Londoners in Richmond upon Thames will celebrate being the largest Fairtrade capital in the world by enjoying free Fairtrade chocolate available from the local steering group&#8217;s stall in Richmond town centre on the 23 October from 12-1pm. Events will also be taking place in other boroughs around London. In achieving Fairtrade City status, the nation&#8217;s capital is sending a strong message that the people of London want trade to be fairer.</p>

<p>Richmond upon Thames Council Leader, Serge Lourie said:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Now London has achieved Fairtrade City status we can really stake our claim as the Fairtrade Capital of the World.</p>

<p>Richmond upon Thames is proud to play its part in tipping the balance of trade in favour of producers but we recognise that there is much more to be done. We hope that people in Richmond upon Thames and all over London will continue to do their bit by buying fair trade goods and by getting their schools and workplaces to stock more Fairtrade marked products.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2008/10/sundays_were_different_then_14th_april_1963.html">Sundays Were Different Then -14th April 1963</a></h3>

<p><img src="https://stmargarets.london/assets/images/2008/crawdaddy_stones-thumb.jpg" width="150" height="112" alt="photo by Phil Bird from www.eelpie.org/music01.htm"  align="right" style="padding: 2px; border: 1px solid #ccc;" /></p>


<p><em>Sundays were different then&#8230;</em></p>

<p>Few cars. Shops closed. Empty streets. No movement. Silence broken only by church bells. To make matters worse - on Sunday 14th April 1963 it was raining too!</p>

<p>At ABC Studios in Teddington the Beatles are recording an insert for &#8220;Thank your Lucky Stars&#8221;. They are miming to their third release &#8220;From Me to You&#8221;. Their last record &#8220;Please Please Me&#8221; had gone to No. 2 in the charts. Although it will be seven months before we hear the term &#8220;Beatlemania&#8221; the word is out. The Beatles are &#8216;hot&#8217;!</p>

<p>As the Beatles rehearse in Teddington a young rhythm and blues band, formed only 10 months earlier, are setting up for an afternoon session at Ken Colyer&#8217;s Jazz Club in Soho. It is the start of a busy day for them. Later that evening they will travel out to Richmond to play at a club called the Crawdaddy recently opened at the Railway Hotel. It is run by a young Russian emigre and film maker, Giorgio Gomelsky. Mick, Charlie, Keith, Bill, Brian and Ian are looking forward to that. When they first played at the Crawdaddy two months ago there were only 50 kids in the audience. Last Sunday there were 320! Suddenly rhythm and blues is no longer the music of traddies, jazzers and weirdy beardies. Over the last few months it has caught the fancy of young, trendy, discriminating teenagers.</p>

<p>Giorgio Gromelsky is a chancer. Knowing that the Beatles are at the studios in Teddington he drives down in the hope they will allow him to make a documentary about them. Their manager, Brian Epstein, already dreaming about the Beatles and Hollywood, gently turns him down. Undismayed Giorgio invites the band to stop in at the Crawdaddy on their way back to London. There is a &#8220;full-bodied R&amp;B band&#8221; that he wants them to see. He tells the boys that the Crawdaddy, like the Cavern in Liverpool, has become a linchpin in the rapidly changing music, fashion and style scene. Only the day before, Saturday 13th April 1963, journalist Barry May had written in the &#8216;Richmond and Twickenham Times&#8217;&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p>A musical magnet is drawing the jazz Beatniks &#8230;to a new mecca in Richmond. The attraction is the Crawdaddy Rhythm and Blues Club at the Station Hotel&#8230; Save for the swaying forms of the group on the spotlit stage, the room is in darkness. A patch of light from the entrance doors catches the swaying dancers and those who have slumped to the floor. The combo they writhe and twist to is called &#8220;the Rolling Stones&#8221; - maybe you&#8217;ve never heard of them&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>Not yet, Barry.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2008/10/event_reminder_book_now_literature_festival_2008.html">Event Reminder: Book Now Literature Festival 2008</a></h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.richmond.gov.uk/home/leisure_and_culture/arts/book_now_literature_festival.htm">Book Now Literature Festival</a> is celebrating its seventeenth anniversary this year from 1 to 25 November with events nearly every day..</p>

<blockquote><p>Joining us are biographers, novelists and leading figures from film, theatre and politics. Together with celebrated writers of science and philosophy, an adventurer and a poet, there is something to appeal to all.</p>

<p>There is a focus on extraordinary lives: whether it&#8217;s the writers&#8217; own lives or their subjects&#8217;, the true-life stories that are revealed are remarkable and inspirational; and two anniversaries will be celebrated: the 30th birthday of Virago Books and the 400th anniversary of Milton&#8217;s birth.</p></blockquote>

<p>Most of the events are listed on <a href="https://stmargarets.london/directory/art/200610191449">this site</a>, but check the <a href="http://www.richmond.gov.uk/literature">official site</a> for any late changes and tickets.</p>
