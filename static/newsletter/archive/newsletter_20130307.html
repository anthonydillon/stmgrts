<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2013/03/the_day_the_church_fell_down.html">The Day the Church Fell Down</a></h3>

<p><img src="https://stmargarets.london/assets/images/2013/CHURCHDOWN_St_Mary_the_Virgin_thumb.jpg" width="150" height="96" alt="St Mary the Virgin" align="right" style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 1px;"/></p>

<p>The old church had been sitting on a rise of high land by the river for over 400 years and it was in poor structural repair.  The medieval ragstone was pulling apart and some of the interior pillars were on the point of collapse. (The original supporting walls had been removed in 1640 and replaced by pillars to improve the lighting and make more room. That was not a good idea.)</p>

<p>Most of the parishioners knew that the church was going to fall down before long and so did the new vicar, Dr. Samuel Pratt. He refused to preach inside the building.  According to Lady Wentworth,  <em>&#8220;Dr Pratt had insisted that a tabernacle be erected in the churchyard, prior to the collapse. Soe he preached there and exhorted al to giv thanks for their great deliverance for the church not falling when they were in it, it being then standing. The people all laughed at him, and in a week&#39;s time it fell to the ground, soe all the parish contributes to the building of it.&#8221;<sup class="footnote"><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2013/03/the_day_the_church_fell_down.html#fn1">1</a></sup></em></p>

<p>And so, as feared - on the night of 9<sup>th</sup> April 1713 the parish church of St Mary the Virgin in Twickenham, fell down.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2013/03/friends_of_moormead_officially_formed.html">Friends of Moormead Officially Formed</a></h3>

<p>The Friends of Moormead was formally inaugurated at a well attended meeting at the Turks Head on Tuesday 5<sup>th</sup> March 2013. The appointment to the Committee of those who had offered to serve was confirmed by the members. Stephen Alexander and Mandie Adams McGuire were elected Chairman and vice Chairman. The other officers required will be appointed later. The Constitution, as required by LBRuT was adopted.</p>

<p>The meeting discussed a number of points, the Pavilion and the new tennis courts management, amongst others. In order to establish what the Friends of Moormead and other residents see as priorities for our park it was decided to deliver a questionnaire to all households in the area. The answers will help the Friends in their dialogue with LBRuT.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2013/03/john_armstrong_obituary.html">John Armstrong - OBITUARY</a></h3>

<p>John Armstrong died recently, and his memorial service was held at St Mary&#39;s Church, Church Street, Twickenham, on Monday 4 March. John chaired the inward investment group of the Twickenham Town Centre Management Board and was active in getting new specialised businesses into the town, including Laverstoke Park butchers and the new Ruben&#39;s bakery. He was also a boatbuilder and designer - his company, Thanetcraft, designed and built the Hammerton&#39;s ferryboat, Peace of Mind. For many years he was on the committee of the York House Society, and his energy and commitment are much missed.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2013/03/press_release_richmond_inclusive_schools_campaign.html">Press Release - Richmond Inclusive Schools Campaign - 5 March 2013</a></h3>

<p><em>Good News On Secondary School Admissions - But For How Long?</em></p>

<p>Commenting on the new about secondary school offers recently made by Richmond Council, Richmond Inclusive Schools Campaign (RISC) said:</p>

<p>It&#39;s good news that more children were offered places at one of their preferred schools in this year&#39;s secondary school offer round than in previous years. But hidden behind this &#39;good news story&#39; are concerns about future years that remain unchanged.</p>

<p>It was clear there would be enough places in 2013, when there will be a dip in the numbers leaving borough primary schools. But RISC remains concerned about the year-on-year increases in 2014, 2015 and 2016. By 2016, nearly 400 more children will be leaving borough primaries than in 2013.</p>
