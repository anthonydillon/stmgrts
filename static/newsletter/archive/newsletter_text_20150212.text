ï»¿ON THE TWICKENHAM FERRY WITH BETJEMAN, POOTER AND MARZIALS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    In a radio programme broadcast on Christmas Eve 1950, the poet John
    Betjeman invited listeners to join him at a Victorian
    musical evening...

    "A large coal fire is leaping in the grate; fans and watercolours
    are hung upon the walls... In another room is a piano and beside it
    a silk screen, Louis Seize style. The folding doors of the sitting
    room have been thrown open into the dining room to make the place
    bigger. We are warm, well fed and ready to be entertained. It is a
    suburban evening in the 1890s and some friends have come in
    with their music."

EVENT REMINDER: NOEL COWARD'S BRIEF ENCOUNTER - 18 TO 20 FEBRUARY 2015
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Few can be unfamiliar with the classic 1945 David Lean film weepie
    Brief Encounter, scripted by Noel Coward from his original one-act
    play Still Life. Set in provincial England in the winter of
    1938/39, it is a love story like no other. Two people, Laura and
    Alec, both married with children, meet by chance in a railway
    station buff. What follows is a heart-rendering dissection of a
    love affair constrained by the dictates of pre-war middle
    class morality.

    Stopgap Production of Brief Encounter which is on at Isleworth
    Public Hall from 18 to 20 February 2015. The play, with music and
    not just Rachmaninov's 2nd piano concerto underplaying some of the
    dialogue, starts at 7.45 pm.

RUGBY WORLD CUP 2015 COMMUNITY INFORMATION MEETINGS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    To ensure that residents and businesses are informed and understand
    the closure and indeed the impact of the tournament on the wider
    borough, the Richmond Council has organised a series of local
    briefings in key areas. Representatives from ER2015 organisers, the
    RFU, the Council and local police will be in attendance.

LOCAL CHILDREN'S CLASS CELEBRATE PANCAKE DAY
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Teaching pre-schoolers racquet skills by tossing Pancakes!

    Catch-a-balls will be celebrating the week of Pancake Day
    by practicing tossing 'pancakes' in their classes. Instead of
    batter and frying pans, a racquet and rubber disk will be used.

    With children as young as 18 months, the practice starts
    with balancing their pancake on the racquet and working to keep it
    there! The older children (well 3 year olds!) find out how quickly
    they need to lower their racquet and bring it back up to launch the
    pancake into the air before we challenge them to try to catch it
    on the way back down.

    The parents seem to enjoy this challenge too, doing lots
    of demonstrating for the children... what better way to impress the
    family than the perfect pancake toss with the real thing when they
    get back home? Makes for tastier pancakes as well, without extra
    special toppings from the floor!

NEW AFTER SCHOOL ACTIVITY AT ORLEANS HOUSE GALLERY - FEBRUARY TO MARCH 2015
----------------------------------------------------------------------


    Introducing a series of performance based workshops for 4-7
    year olds.

    Orleans House Gallery is pleased to announce an exciting brand new
    after school activity, Star Club. Combining, movement, story
    telling, music and art -- spend 5 weeks working with performance
    and art practitioner Liz Howell.

    Taking inspiration from the exhibition and surrounding natural
    environment of Orleans House Gallery, we will learn about creative
    performance making, communication and group work, building to a
    small showcase before Easter.

COUNCILLORS CALL FOR URGENT RETHINK OF RICHMOND COLLEGE PLANS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    St Margarets and North Twickenham Councillors, Alexander Ehmann,
    Ben Khosa and Geoff Acton have backed a majority of local residents
    who have expressed deep misgivings about the proposed access plans
    for Richmond Council's proposed redevelopment of Richmond College.

    At present the Council plans propose that access to the residential
    element of the development would be provided via the residential
    roads to the East of the site; most notably via Egerton Road.
    Having listened to the concerns of local residents, the Liberal
    Democrat Councillors for the area have written to Councillor
    Stephen Speak (Conservative Cabinet Members for Highways) and to Mr
    Leon Daniels (Managing Director, Surface Transport at Transport
    for London) asking for an urgent rethink of the present proposals.
