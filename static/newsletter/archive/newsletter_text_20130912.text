ï»¿THE OTHER RICHMOND PARK

    Should you find yourself in Kalutara in west Sri Lanka, twiddling
    your thumbs and wondering what to do next, having already seen the
    Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage, the famous Asokaramaya Buddhist
    Temple and the world's only hollow 'stupa', then ask a local
    tuk-tuk driver for ideas. He might just take you to Richmond Park
    where you will find Richmond Castle.

STAY CLASSY HARRIS + HOOLE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    NOTE: Harris + Hoole has withdrawn their application.


    Coffee shop Harris and Hoole angers Twickenham residents by
    applying for booze licence

    The "independent" coffee shop chain part owned by Tesco has angered
    local residents and police in Twickenham by applying for a licence
    to serve beer and wine.

    The St Margarets Road branch of Harris and Hoole, in which Tesco
    has a 49 per cent stake, is seeking permission from Richmond Upon
    Thames council for the right to sell alcohol seven days a week
    from 11am to 10pm.

    But Mark Halton of the borough's police licensing team, has
    objected to the application on the grounds that it will "attract
    street drinkers to the area and this will cause an increase
    in anti-social behaviour."

    Mr Halton said that if street drinkers could buy alcohol from late
    morning "it will cause them to congregate on street benches" close
    to St Stephens Church of England Junior School.

    "This will increase the likelihood of children witnessing
    drunkeness and urinating in the street," he said.

    Mr Halton also revealed he had not been able to speak to management
    at Harris + Hoole to discuss his concerns because there is no phone
    number on the application.
