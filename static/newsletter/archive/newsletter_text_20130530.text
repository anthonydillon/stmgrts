ï»¿THE MAN WHO KEPT COPROLITES IN KEW
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Charles Gibaut Bissell-Thomas was born in Jersey in the Channel
    Islands on Tuesday 13th March 1956. He was never happy with that
    name so as a teenager he changed it - first to Charlight Utang,
    then Soma Love, again by deed poll to Jungleyes Cism Love and
    finally Jarl Love. Then he opened a shop in Kew called 'World Tree
    Mend Us'.

    Jungle, as most people knew him, had always questioned established
    belief. At primary school he asked the head teacher why they didn't
    worship the Devil as well as Christ. At his next school, Harrow, he
    persuaded the Chinese Embassy to send the school 725 copies
    of Chairman Mao's famous 'Little Red Book'. They were promptly
    sent back.

UNSURPRISING RESULTS IN HEATHROW REFERENDUM
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Over 100,000 west London residents have spoken out against any
    Heathrow expansion in a local referendum.

    In a huge exercise in local democracy, Richmond upon Thames and
    Hillingdon Councils have been holding borough-wide ballots to offer
    residents an opportunity to express their views on the proposed
    expansion of Heathrow.

    The results show that an overwhelming majority of residents in both
    boroughs (72%) are against a third runway and 73% do not want to
    see any more flights in or out of the airport. That is over 100,000
    people saying 'No' to both questions.

    Over the four week voting period (from 22 April to 16 May) 342,514
    residents were invited to cast their vote on two questions:

    1. Should a third runway be built at Heathrow?
    2. Are you in favour of more flights into and out of Heathrow?

    140,516 returned their vote. An overall turnout of 41%.

NEW SEASON, NEW BREED AT PETERSHAM MEADOWS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    The new grazing season has started on Petersham Meadows for 2013
    but with one obvious difference - the new herd is an entirely new
    breed of cattle.

    The previous herd has been replaced with Belted Galloways, a
    traditional British breed with characteristic white stripes
    round their bellies. The animals come with a history of grazing
    in areas with lots of visitors.

    "We are delighted to welcome the new herd to Petersham" said Naomi
     Campbell, National Trust Property Manager. "I am sure they will
     soon become a familiar part of the landscape".

    The new herd has been made possible with the National Trust working
    in partnership with Surrey Wildlife Trust. They will hold the
    overall responsibility for looking after the cows when they are
    on the meadows
