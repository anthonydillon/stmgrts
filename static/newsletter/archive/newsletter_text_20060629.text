MOORMEAD PAVILION CLEANED UP 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Pavilion Clearing Out Day was a big success.  According 
    to Claire Wilson, 
    
       "We had over the course of the day about 50-60 
        helpers and made a fabulous start to the clearing 
        out and cleaning up process.  The interior is 
        emerging as having great potential for community 
        use, the next stage is raising the funds to pay 
        for the internal refurbishment requirements to 
        make it fit for using.  Externally the first 
        coat of paint has gone up, a great job done 
        there by everyone involved, particularly the 
        children who threw themselves into!"

NO CHANGES TO NIGHT FLYING AT HEATHROW
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Department for Transport has announced there will be no 
    increase in night flights at Heathrow for the next six years.  It 
    has backed down from its proposal to increase flights numbers at 
    the airport between 11:30pm and 6am.  The number will remain 
    at 16.  Most of these flights arrive between 4:30 and 6am.  There 
    are no scheduled take-offs between these hours, though from time 
    to time BAA will permit aircraft running late to take off 
    after 11:30pm...
