HERE ARE PICTURES FOR FRANCES
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    

If you recall, in the article Pictures for Frances, we asked readers to submit photos for a former resident of St Margarets who longs for news and images of St Margarets.  We have had two great submissions:



Christopher Squire left a comment about the Geograph website
Bob Goran loaded many area photos onto Flickr
We have also posted a few here




Check them out and if you have more, either email us at content@stmgrts.org.uk or add them to a free flickr account and tag the photos stmgrts.
