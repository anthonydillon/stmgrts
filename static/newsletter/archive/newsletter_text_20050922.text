LATEST NEWS
===========================================================



     

        
APPLICATION FOR WINE BAR RE-SUBMITTED
-----------------------------------------------------------
    A group of local businessmen (Grapespot Ltd of Kingston) 
    have resubmitted their application to open a wine bar in 
    the basement formerly occupied by Phelps. This application 
    requires a change of use (A4) to the property. Grapespot's 
    plan to call the wine bar ParVinu at Phelps and offer 
    retail wine sales, wine tastings and seating and a bar 
    for drinking and dining on site.
    
    This story has attracted a lot of community interest and 
    the poll shows that people strongly dislike the idea (more 
    than 80% don't want it).  Most are concerned with the size 
    of the venue, what happens if it doesn't attract an upscale 
    crowd -- but a young rowdy one or if the wine bar ever fails, 
    what is someone worse moves as the planning permission has 
    been alredy changed.
    
    This St Margaret Community Website is going to interview the 
    men behind Grapespot next week, let us know your questions 
    at content@stmgrts.org.uk.
