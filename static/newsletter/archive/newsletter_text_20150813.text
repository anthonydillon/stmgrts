LATEST NEWS
===========================================================



ï»¿ME NO SEE RWC LEGACY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    I've heard most of the arguments about the Rugby World Cup being
    good for the local economy - and I suppose, like most people, I am
    ready and prepared to put up with the inconvenience - the traffic
    diversions, the closed streets, the hoards of fans, the
    'porta-potty' toilets, the crowded trains, the litter and the noise
    into the early hours of the morning. This the price of living next
    door to Twickenham Stadium at the time of the Rugby World Cup. I
    accept this. What I cannot accept is the apparent lack of any
    recognition, recompense or legacy for the thousands of people who
    will have to put up with it.

SIR DAVID ATTENBOROUGH BECOMES A PATRON OF THE HOLLY LODGE CENTRE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    The Trustees of the Holly Lodge Centre in Richmond Park are
    extremely pleased to announce that Sir David Attenborough has
    agreed to become a patron of the Centre.

    Sir David joined groups of students from two local schools
    in opening the Centre's revitalized nature trail in June of this
    year and expressed his enthusiasm for the work of the Centre.
    "Richmond Park is my favourite place and here in the middle of it
    is this wonderful Holly Lodge education centre and its nature
    trail. Schoolchildren can get a real hands-on experience of nature,
    with some remarkable facilities for those with special educational
    needs. We all talk about the 'nature deficit' of many children;
    here is a practical way to combat that."
