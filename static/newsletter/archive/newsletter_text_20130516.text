LATEST NEWS
===========================================================



ï»¿OPERATION CHASTISE
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    "Apres moi, le deluge"

     - The Motto of 617 Squadron

    Almost exactly 70 years ago, on the evening of 16th May 1943, an
    event took place that has become imprinted on the British
    character. There will be many of us who know the story rather well
    - the stressed but determined engineer, the 'press-on-regardless'
    pilot and his team of courageous flyers, the dog that was killed
    and the mighty concrete walls that came crashing down. Most of all
    we remember a piece of music that is still whistled ironically
    on holiday jets coming in to land at Malaga and Palma, played
    at football matches and used in TV commercials. The official name
    for this event was 'Operation Chastise' but to most people it is
    the 'Dambusters Raid'.

THE FACE OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN ST MARGARETS?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    - a letter from a local resident

    For a number of weeks I have been attempting to involve our St
    Margarets neighbourhood police team in doing something
    about sexually explicit advertisements on the notice boards of our
    two local news agents - this, in the knowledge that this type
    of advertisement is sometimes placed not by the individual offering
    such services, but by those who control them. The response
    from Constable Peebles is that in his opinion these are perfectly
    harmless and in the eyes of the police "there is no offence
    being committed".

ANYONE FOR SEVEN-A-SIDE FOOTBALL?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Players needed for competitive (but friendly) weekly
    7-a-side football

    I organise a group of local players that get together every
    Wednesday evening at 9pm for a game of 7-a-side, and we need a few
    extra players to keep the numbers up.

    If you are interested in playing - it's a reasonable standard and
    competitive but always friendly and good natured - then drop me a
    note at richard.jackson100 (at) gmail.com.

    We currently play at Goals at Gillette Corner and the cost is
    8/session. pounds

    There are also occasional beers afterwards from time to time!
