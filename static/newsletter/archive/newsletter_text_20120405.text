ï»¿GENESIS AND THE EASTER EGG
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    "The fact that I cannot remember too much of it doesn't mean that I
     wasn't there. The fact that I can remember some of it doesn't mean
     that I was..."

    Nearly 40 years ago I was sitting in a pub in Hampstead boring my
    flatmate to death with my troubles - tedious job, love life in a
    mess blah blah blah - when the man sitting across the table
    leaned forward.

    "Can you drive?" he asked.
    "Yes."
    "Do you know anything about rock groups?"
    "Well, er... a bit"
    "Do you fancy a job as a roadie?"

POEMS IN THE PARK... IN THE PARK!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    For those looking for a bit of local exercise and outdoor cultural
    inspiration over the Easter Holidays, look no further than
    Richmond Park.

    The winners', runners-up and commended poems from the the Poems
    in the Park competition, organised by the Friends of Richmond Park,
    are currently on display in Pembroke Lodge Gardens in the Park. One
    of the joint-winners in the adult category is St Margarets resident
    Chris Rice with his clever, witty poem Kingfisher, Beverly Brook
    and there are other brilliant poems from local and nearby residents
    in the other age categories, 13-18 years and 12 years and under.

GREEN LIGHT GIVEN FOR TWICKENHAM STATION DEVELOPMENT
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Construction work on the new Twickenham Station development is set
    to start in September 2012 now that the plans have been formally
    approved by Richmond Council.

    Following the announcement that neither the Secretary of State
    for Communities and Local Government or the GLA will formally
    intervene in the Planning Committee decision (December 2011), the
    Council has now formally signed off the legal Section 106 agreement
    and issued planning permission which allows the development
    to commence.

    It is hoped that the work will commence in September 2012 and will
    be completed in time for the Rugby World Cup in 2015. Over the next
    few months, Solum Regeneration will be working up detailed designs
    and appointing a contractor.
