WHEN A HOLLYWOOD LEGEND VISITED ST MARGARETS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    On Monday 8th July 1985 a production of Tennessee Williams's play
    "Sweet Bird of Youth", directed by Harold Pinter, opened at the
    Haymarket Theatre in London's West End. The star of the show was
    the sultry Hollywood star Lauren Bacall, the widow of Humphrey
    Bogart. It was an appropriate piece of casting. "Sweet Bird
    of Youth" written in 1959 tells of a fading movie star, Alexandria
    Del Lago, and her relationship with gigolo and drifter Chance
    Wayne. One commentator said that the part was written for Bacall,
    although Tennessee Williams had originally conceived it for
    Tallulah Bankhead.

COUNCIL SAYS THIRD HEATHROW RUNWAY UNBUILDABLE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Councils opposed to expansion at Heathrow have told the Transport
    Select Committee that the most recent evidence published by the
    Government continues to demonstrate that a third runway could not
    be built at the airport without causing unacceptable air and
    noise pollution.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    A Planning Application to redevelop Twickenham Riverside has been
    submitted and will be open to statutory consultation.

    Over the past two years the Council has been consulting
    with residents and businesses in Twickenham on proposals for a new
    development on King Street / Water Lane and Twickenham Riverside.
    The development site includes three properties on the corner of
    King Street and Water Lane, the car park to the rear and the
    derelict former swimming pool buildings.
