<p>On 20 April 2007, Richmond Council has <a href="http://www.ukplanning.com/richmond/showCaseFile.do?councilName=London+Borough+of+Richmond+upon+Thames&amp;appNumber=07%2F0599%2FFUL">refused planning permission</a> for <em>Your Parmacy&#8217;s</em> <a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2007/03/your_pharmacy_a.html">application</a> for an external <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">ATM.</span></span></span></p>

<p>Reason for the refusal was that the plans would &#8220;visually clutter&#8221; the shop frontage, the street scene and the entire St Margarets&#39; conservation area.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2007/04/crown_road_surgery_moving_to_richmond_lock.html">Crown Road Surgery Moving to Richmond Lock</a></h3>

<p>For those who are not aware, the Crown Road Surgery is going to be moving to a new building on the old Brunnel site in August, 2007.  The surgery will be located on St Margarets Road, opposite the Talbot Road junction.  A larger building with better access are sited as the reasons for the move.</p>

<p>Patients will not have to change registrations as a result of the move.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2007/04/brooks_blues_bar_leaving_the_turks_head.html">Brooks Blues Bar Leaving the Turks Head</a></h3>

<p>After seven months, Brooks Blues Bar has decided to move from the Turks Head due to poor &#8220;low audience numbers&#8221;.  Tomorrow night&#8217;s show with <em>Open Harp Surgery</em> is the last on the calendar.  Its a shame its is going, we went to two shows and both were excellent.</p>

<p>Here is a note from Tony Bell and Ann Rosenberg, owners of Brooks Blues Bar,</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Sadly, tomorrow (with Open Harp Surgery booked) is the last of our weekly Thursday events at The Turks Head &#8212; however we can assure everybody of a really good farewell party even if there are only a few of us there!</p></blockquote>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2007/04/interview_jo_dunbar_of_botanica_medica_herbal_apot.html">Interview: Jo Dunbar of Botanica Medica Herbal Apothecary</a></h3>

<p><img src="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/assets/images/2007/jo_dunbar-thumb.jpg" width="112" height="150" alt="Jo Dunbar of Botanica Medica" align="right" style="padding: 2px; border: 1px solid #ccc;"/></a></p>

<p><em>In December last year, Medical Herbalist, Jo Dunbar opened her second herbal apothecary. We visited the beautiful old-world apothecary in Crown Road to see what it is all about.</em></p>

<p><strong>What made you choose St Margarets to set up your second apothecary?</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>I have been going out with Martin Herdman (proprietor of <em>The Herdman Family Carpet Shop</em>) for several years, so I have spent a lot of time in St Margarets. I opened my first herbal apothecary, in a tiny little road in Claygate, 4 years ago, and at the time, both Martin and his son Jacob said that it will never work there, and I should have opened in Crown Road. Well, fortunately the apothecary proved so popular that we have patients both locally and internationally. But there came a time when I started thinking of opening a second apothecary, and a large corner shop became available in Crown Road. Initially Martin spotted it as a second Botanica Medica, but after some thought decided to move the Carpet Shop over the road and completely renovate his shop to house <a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/directory/health_aNd_beauty/200704050227">Botanica Medica</a>.</p></blockquote>
