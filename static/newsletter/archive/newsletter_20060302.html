<p><em>2 March 2006</em></p>

<p>Welcome to the St Margarets Community Website Newsletter (<a href="https://stmargarets.london">stmargarets.london</a>).  Each Thursday we will send you the latest news and events from the website.</p>

<h2>Latest News</h2>


<!-- start include file /home/stmargarets/html/static/newsletter/news_story.incl -->

<div id="special">

<p>Four special things to mention:</p>


<ol>
<li>Tonight is the planning meeting that should decide the <strong>ParVinu Winebar&#8217;s</strong> permission.  It is at York House at 6:30pm.</li>
<li>Tomorrow is <a href="https://stmargarets.london/cgi-bin/events.cgi?key=200602021132&amp;action=getevent">Turkstock 2006 - St Stephen&#8217;s Benefit</a> at 7:30pm in the Turk&#8217;s Head.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2006/02/2x2_opera_needs.html">2&#215;2 Opera</a> has found a place to work, but still needs: a joiner, timber (rather a lot of it) and  a few extra voices in the adult chorus - 2x soprano,2x  alto, 3x tenor, 1x bass.  So please help if you can.</li>
<li>Also, a little further out, but a good cause is <a href="https://stmargarets.london/cgi-bin/events.cgi?key=200602091031&amp;action=getevent">The Shooting Star Children&#8217;s Hospice : A Very Special Music Night</a> again at the Turk&#8217;s Head, but please call Toby (07786 193662) to book tickets.  <a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2006/02/a_starstudded_n.html">Read about it here</a></li>
</ol>



<p>That&#8217;s it.  Oh, Al Murray is at the <a href="https://stmargarets.london/cgi-bin/events.cgi?key=200602151421&amp;action=getevent">Bearcat Comedy Club</a> this week! </p>

</div>


<h3>Moormead Park Meeting</h3>

<p>Following on from the original meeting, another meeting of interested residents and groups is being called for Thursday, 9 March at 7.30pm in the Turks&#8217; Head, Winchester Hall.</p>

<p>The purpose of the meeting is to agree the key areas for refurbishment, begin the process of looking at fund-raising ideas for supporting these, in partnership with the Council and are hoping to form a representative local group &#8212; <em>Friends of Moormead Park</em>.</p>

<p>Anyone interested in being involved in the discussion, and in particular the fundraising, please let Claire Wilson know; email <a href="mailto:%63%6F%72%70%75%6E%69%74%40%61%6F%6C%2E%63%6F%6D">corpunit@aol.com</a> or call 020 8744 0700. </p>

<h3>Marble Hill Cafe Closing</h3>

<p>The caf&#233; based in the coach house is closing down having given very little notice to its workers.  </p>

<p>Local resident Sara Bellamy informed us that, &#8220;the poor girls only got a week&#8217;s pay and some of them have rent to pay, it&#8217;s outrageous!&#8221;</p>

<p>According to the <em>English Heritage</em> the current owners had been losing money for years and have not renewed their lease.  English Heritage put out a tender for the lease, but have not found a new company to take over the operation.</p>

<h3>Funeral for James Gilby</h3>

<p>The 1<sup>st</sup> of March 2006 was the funeral of Twickenham teen, James Gilby, who died of a heart attack on 13<sup>th</sup> February while playing football in Moormead Park.  The funeral was held at St Mary&#8217;s Church in Twickenham.</p>

<p>James, aged 17, went to St Mary&#8217;s Primary School, Orleans Park School and Richmond College and played bass in a local band, The Riots.</p>



<h3>Review : Kew Gardens&#8217; Orchid Festival</h3>

<p><img src="https://stmargarets.london/assets/images/2006/dirks_kew_orchid-thumb.jpg" width="150" height="112" alt="Dirk Winter's Kew Orchid" title="Dirk Winter's Kew Orchid" align="right" /></p>

<p>In our new tradition of reviewing shows that are nearly ending, we thought we should mention the excellent Orchid Festival which ends this Sunday, 5<sup>th</sup> March 2006.  Most of the display of 250,000 flowers is housed in the <em>Princess of Wales Conservatory</em>, so no marching all over the grounds.</p>

<p>This year the theme is &#8220;Orchids in Art and Design&#8221; with many displays in the form of paint spilling from tubes, as paint on brushes or on a pallet.  There are also some educational boards explaining how orchids have inspired everything from Art Nouveau to wallpaper to Korean art.  However the stars of the show are the flowers themselves.  Why not head over this weekend and be awed?</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t forget to bring the kids!</p>
