LATEST NEWS
===========================================================



JOIN THE ADVENTURE!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The 1st St Margarets Scout Group came into being nearly 90 years
    ago. As their motto says, they've been "in tents since 1919"!
    
    From a small group of boys meeting in a dusty Church Hall the 
    group has grown spectacularly. Now there is a lively Beavers colony
    for the under 8's, a 20 strong Cub Pack, a Scout Troop and an 
    Explorer Unit for the older Scouts. Such is the expansion that 
    the Group has just been awarded a special certificate to mark
    the impressive increase in membership.
    
    Scouting has also developed since 1919. Tying knots and putting 
    up tents may still be part of the programme but today's activities 
    include canoeing, abseiling, go karting, survival training, 
    computer skills and even spending nights in some strange places
    like the gun deck of "H.M.S Belfast" or the vaults at London 
    Dungeon! Modern Scouting is also open at all levels to girls. 
    I wonder what Baden Powell who founded the movement would 
    think of that!?
    
    Success does bring its own problems however and now the 
    1st St Margarets is looking for helpers and leaders to take 
    the group forward. In particular the Beavers, aged between
    6 and 8 years, are looking for a leader to organise their 
    meetings and guide them through their many activities. Life
    in the Beaver Colony can be great fun and challenging too, 
    but there is help on all sides. As well as full support 
    from within the Group, the Scout Organisation itself has 
    a website bursting with suggestions for activities and games.
    
    The main principle of Scouting is to help young people 
    develop their own potential, physically, intellectually, 
    spiritually and socially. It doesn't take much to set a 
    young person on the right road and this is your chance 
    to do just that. Remember what the wise old owl Socrates 
    said...
    
    "No man goeth about a more godly purpose then he who is
    mindful of the right upbringing not only of his own, but
    of other men's children".
    
    If you would like to learn more about becoming a leader 
    or helper please ring Anna Scothern on 020 8332 9068 or
    by E Mail to annascothern@yahoo.com

THE RED HOT FOLLOW UP STORY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    About a year ago a local bunch of gently decaying rock 'n' roll 
    musicians realised that the only way they were going to save their
    much loved band, the Shudders, from dereliction and destitution, 
    was to take on a couple of hip shaking chantoosies, who could 
    'shoo bee doo' like the Shirelles and 'dah doo ron ron' like 
    the Ronettes.
    
    So...
    
    They placed a smoothly worded small ad in the prestigious pages 
    of the St Margarets Community Website Newsletter stating quite
    bluntly that age and experience were totally immaterial... 
    Rock Chicks Needed!
    
    Soon...
    
    A couple of totally inexperienced hip shaking chantoosies appeared
    and before long had doo lang doo lang'ed their way into the band's 
    hearts and more importantly the band's repertoire. Inevitably they
    became known as 'The Shudderelles'.
    
    Now the same bunch of rock 'n' roll musicians - no longer gently
    decaying - and their hip shaking chantoosies are ready to make 
    some noise. You can catch them in action, as live as you like, 
    at the St Margarets Fair on Saturday 12th July and the 
    Strawberry Hill Music Fair, the following day, Sunday 13th July. 
    Just look out for "Nark Drool and the Shudders, featuring the
    Sensational Shudderelles".
    
    Which only goes to show. It does pay to advertise. Locally. 
    In the St Margarets Community Website Newsletter.
    
    For more information on the band please contact:-

MORE ON MARBLE HILL CONCERTS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    We asked Tim Beale, the Visitor Operations Manager of Marble Hill
    House, why only two concerts this year?  Here was the reply:
    
    "With IMG pulling out of managing the concerts we were initially
    faced with the prospect of no concerts. Luckily MA concerts stepped
    in but as you can imagine this was at quite a late stage so almost 
    impossible to book good artists at such short notice.
    
    We are still hoping that the amendment to the premises licence is
    granted to allow us to have a third concert on the Friday night."
    
    -- Tim Beale, Visitor Operations Manager, 
    Chiswick House & Marble Hill House
