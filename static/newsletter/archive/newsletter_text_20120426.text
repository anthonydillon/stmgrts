ï»¿THE FIRST CUCKOO?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    "Hounslow, whose heath sublimer terror fills,
     Shall with her gibbets lend her powder mills."

     - WILLIAM MASON "Heroic Epistle" 1773

    There were two things that must have depressed people living
    around these parts in the 18th and 19th centuries. The first was
    the likelihood of being robbed by highwaymen and footpads
    on Hounslow Heath. The second was the real possibility of being
    blown up by any one of the many gunpowder mills operating along the
    River Crane.

    Although it is difficult to prove, it does seem that this area has
    had a long association with explosives...

TWICKENHAM FILM STUDIOS GETS A LIFELINE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Agreed sale will see the studios' work continue and all jobs saved,
    say administrators

    Campaigners attempting to avert the closure of Twickenham Film
    Studios are holding their breath after it was announced on Tuesday
    that a sale had been agreed to save the site, but the buyer's
    identity would remain secret until the deal had gone through.

    Gerald Krasner, administrator for the studios, said: "It is the
    purchaser's intention to continue to trade as studios and
    to preserve all the jobs." He said the buyer had handed over a
    non-returnable deposit of #100,000, but would not reveal the full
    purchase price.

SUMMER WEATHER
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    "Whether the weather is cold.
     Or whether the weather is hot.
     You should weather the weather,
     Whatever the weather,
     Whether you like it or not!"

    What will the weather be like this summer? Shall I go cruising
    around the Grenadines on my private yacht or go caravanning
    on Hayling Island as usual?

    To find the answer I turned once again to Brewer's Dictionary
    of Phrase and Fable... and once again it came up trumps. Which tree
    gets its leaves first?

      If the Oak's before the Ash
      Then you'll only get a splash;
      If the Ash precedes the Oak,
      Then you may expect a soak.

    Does anyone know what the Oak and the Ash have been up to recently?

LETTER FROM TWICKENHAM RESIDENTS ACTION GROUP - 25 APRIL 2012
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    editor's note:  we received this email and are posting as is, as we
                    cannot prove the allegations in the letter, but
                    believe it deserves publishing.


    Dear Editor,

    Lord True (Leader of Richmond Council) and the Planning Office have
    covered-up a highly critical report, produced by their own advisory
    group, concerning the residential development over Twickenham
    Railway Station.

    The detailed and extensive report (+80 pages) was prepared by the
    Twickenham Advisory Panel (TAP). Lord True formed TAP to act as an
    'honest broker' - providing a forum for open dialogue between the
    community and the developer (Solum). The report was prepared
    to follow up the questions raised during the public consultation
    event held at Richmond College in July 2011.

    I would like the help of your readers to obtain answers to some
    very basic questions from:

     o Lord True - Leader of Richmond Council
        Cllr.LordTrue@richmond.gov.uk
     o Paul Chadwick - Council Director of Environment
        P.Chadwick@richmond.gov.uk

    Questions:

    1. When was the LBRuT first in possession of the TAP report?
    2. Why did Lord True and the Planning Office decide not to include the
        TAP report with the documents provided for the Planning Meeting
        held on 19th December 2011?
    3. Why was the TAP spokesman barred from the Planning Meeting even
        though he had registered to speak?
    4. When will TAP's recommendations be made public?

    I am sure your readers will have their own questions.

DREAMCATCHER FILM CAMPS TO SURVIVE TWICKENHAM STUDIOS CLOSURE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    You may have heard about the impending closure of Twickenham Film
    Studios and wondered what's happening to our Film Camps this
    summer. Well, although we're very sad to see the demise of such
    historic studios, we're delighted to announce that we have now
    found a smart new home for our Camps at Falcons Boys School in the
    heart of Richmond.

    We're very grateful to our new sponsors the Alpha Plus Group who
    are accomodating us at the school for the summer. It has excellent
    facilities for children and already we can see how its many indoor
    and enclosed outdoor spaces will be used imaginatively by our
    aspiring young filmmakers! With Richmond Station just 5 minutes
    walk away, the school offers excellent transport links via the
    District Line, London Overground and South West trains, along with
    a range of local bus routes.

    Our Easter Film Camp at the school was a great success. Our Summer
    Film Camps begin on the 9th July and will run every week Monday
    to Friday until 31st August. Start and finishing times will remain
    the same at 9am and 2pm respectively.

I LOVE TO HEAR A CHOIR!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    "I love to hear a choir. I love to see the faces of real people
     devoting themselves to a piece of music. I like the teamwork. It
     makes me feel optimistic about the human race!"

     - PAUL McCARTNEY

    Singing in choirs is good for you too - whether you are performing
    Handel's 'Messiah', clapping along to Gospel or pumping out some
    seductive 'shang-a-langs' in a doo-wop quartet. Choral singing
    opens the airways, develops the voice and instils confidence. Above
    all choir singing is fun and you don't need any experience or read
    music to do it. Essentially it is about joining friends to make a
    joyous noise - be it Bach, the Beatles or Beyonce!

    Now a new and local Community Choir is starting in St Margarets
    to raise that friendly, joyous noise...and the roof as well. They
    meet on Wednesday afternoons during term-time at All Souls Church,
    Northcote Rd, from 1-3pm. to sing songs from many eras and cultures
    including Jazz, Pop and World music. There will also be breathing
    and vocal exercises to help stretch and develop the voice.

    The cost is 10 pounds per session, but discounts are available. Please
    phone Surya on 07770 993289, or email info@vitalvoices.co.uk

    "Come lift your voices and sing as one.
     Let's raise the roof - and have some fun!"

HELP HANDS - DONATE BABY AND CHILDREN'S CLOTHING
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    At HANDS (Help a neighbour in distress) we are planning to hold a
    Baby & Child clothing sale. We are therefore looking for donations
    of Pre-loved, good quality child & baby clothing.

    Donations can be dropped to HANDS, Bath House, Twickenham, TW1 3DX
    between 9.30 and 12.30 or to Petit Bateau, 56 High Street,
    Richmond-upon-Thames, TW9 1TW (To discuss the possibility of a
    local collection please phone Maxine - 07719938889).

    All money raised will go towards running costs of the Help a
    Neighbour in Distress Scheme. 'HANDS' aims to improve the quality
    of life for people living in the areas of Twickenham & St Margarets
    by giving friendly, practical help to those in need (Charity
    No. 1033694).

LOCAL JOB VACANCY: SESSIONAL PLAYWORKER, TOY LIBRARY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Toy library has an extensive catalogue which includes baby
    toys, construction toys, dressing up, role play, books, sensory
    toys and more.

    Borrowing rather than buying toys is a green way of introducing
    children to new experiences, helping to shrink families' carbon
    footprint. It is also an easier way for children to experience new
    toys without the expense. Our toy library currently holds sessions
    at 6 Children's Centre's and is continuing to grow.

    Marble Hill Playcentres is looking for a Sessional Playworker, who
    is passionate about Play, to work at our Toy library.

TAYLOR WIMPEY WITHDRAW BID FOR TWICKENHAM FILM STUDIOS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    A property developer has withdrawn its bid for Twickenham Film
    Studios because it said it wants to give film consortiums a chance
    to buy and maintain the site.

    Members of the Save Twickenham Film Studios campaign said they were
    delighted with Taylor Wimpey's announcement but were aware that the
    fight to save the studios, which played host to classics including
    Alfie and The Italian Job, was not over.

    Campaign leader Maria Walker said:

    "The CEO has agreed to back-off to give it a chance to be kept as
    a studio.

    "We have won the battle; the fight is still not over.

    "We want to get the message to a developer that does think they can
     get in - we will fight. In fact if anything, the campaign is
     growing, so it has not gone away."

PRIMARY SCHOOL OFFERS DAY - 91% GET A SCHOOL OF THEIR CHOICE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    As demand for primary school places reaches an all time high, more
    in-borough applicants than in previous years have been offered a
    place at one of their preferred schools - 91% compared with 89%
    in 2011.

    On 18 April 2012, Richmond Council will be making the initial
    allocation of reception class offers for this September: 75% have
    been offered a place at their first preference primary school, a
    rise from last year's figure of 73.5%; 88% have been offered a
    place at one of their top three preferred schools, compared with
    86% last year. Those who have not been offered any of their
    preferences will have been offered an alternative - or will be
    offered one in the coming weeks.

    To meet demand for places, last year the Council announced
    additional investment to expand the borough's primary schools,
    as part of a 10 year strategy. This year, an additional three
    permanent forms of entry, for 90 additional children, will be
    provided at Hampton Wick Infant, Orleans Primary, St Stephen's C
    of E Primary, and St Mary's C of E Primary. The provision of the 60
    additional places within St Margarets and central/East Twickenham
    has been particularly helpful in greatly reducing the number
    of children in those areas who would otherwise have been unplaced
    at the initial allocations stage.
