ï»¿A HOUSE DIVIDED
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Once Upon A Present Day...

    George and Flora had been married for a long time and seemed very
    happy together. Of course there had been the occasional row - and
    the dents in the kitchen cabinets suggested that perhaps pots and
    pans had been thrown around in the past - but generally speaking
    all appeared well until...

    One day Flora came to the conclusion that she would be better
    off and much happier living on her own and so she decided to get
    shot of George. She also decided to divide their house down the
    middle, she taking one half and he the other. When she told George
    and just as he began to splutter those inevitable questions
    like "What brought this on?" and "How will you manage on your own?"
    she informed him bluntly that she wasn't interested in his views.
    George thought this rather unfair considering how long they had
    shared and cared for their home.

    A man with Down's syndrome who has lived in Britain for 17 years
    faces being deported - because his parents died.

    Wadih Chourey, 44, moved from Lebanon with his family in 1997
    after suffering abuse by gangs in Beirut.

    He now lives with one of his two brothers Camil, 42, in
    East Twickenham.

    MP Vince Cable said the move by the Home Office to have him kicked
