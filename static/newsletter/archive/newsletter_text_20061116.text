===========================================================



EVENT REMINDER: CHRISTMAS SHOOTING STAR NIGHT
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    December will be ushered in with a special Shooting Start Winter 
    Party at the Turks Head on Friday 1st December in aid 
    of The Shooting Star Children's Hospice. This will definitely 
    put everyone in the mood for a festive Christmas period before 
    getting bogged down with all that Christmas shopping.
    
    With four terrific local Twickenham bands playing a wide range 
    of music, from Motown to Glamrock, it promises to be a 
    fun-filled evening. The headline act is  "The Shooting Ska 
    Allstars" playing their highly infectious blend of Reggae
    and Ska music.  "The Funk Bomb Detonators" kick off the evening
    with 60's Soul and Motown numbers and St Margarets' very own 
    "Doghouse"  will be playing a great selection of hits from 
    across the years. Glitter and platform heels will be the order
    of the day as  Glamrock band "Bulge" go on stage, celebrating 
    10 years since they debuted live for the first time, at the 
    Turk's Head.
    
    The bands are giving up their time for free to ensure that
    all the money raised on the night goes direct to the charity
    and Karen Peffer from Shooting Star is certainly looking 
    forward to it; "After the success of the first music night 
    that took place in March, we are delighted that this second
    event is taking place in St Margarets and we hope lots of 
    people will come and support us and enjoy the party!" 
    
    Tickets are L5 on the door and the music starts at 8.00 pm

EVENT REMINDER: THE GOOD WINE SHOP TASTING
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Good Wine Shop in Isleworth is hosting a special pre-Christmas
    wine tasting event.
    
    A selection of more than 50 quality wines will be on offer for 
    guests to sample during the evening event which takes place at 
    Winchester Hall on Wednesday 22nd November, 6.00pm to 9.00pm. 
    
    Owner Mark Wrigglesworth will be on hand to help guests decipher 
    their Rioja from their Riesling and offer expert tips and advice
    on choosing the best wines for all occasions. Guests will also 
    be able to enjoy a range of carefully selected breads, meats and 
    cheeses to compliment the red, white and sparkling wines. 
    
    Mark said,
    
        "We believe wine is all about enjoyment. There can be 
        a certain snobbery surrounding wines but at The 
        Good Wine Shop we aim to break down those barriers,
        offering the finest vintages from the world's best 
        small producers, which wouldn't normally be found 
        on the high street."

    Special pre-Christmas offers will be available at the event. 
    Tickets can be purchased from The Good Wine Shop in advance
    at a cost of L7.50 per person or L10.00 on the door.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR: THE GAS MAN COMETH (NOT!)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    I'm just wondering if anyone knows how much longer British Gas 
    / Transco / whomever is responsible these days are going to leave
    the hole (or holes, as they have now become) blocking the pavement
    in St Margarets Road (opposite Taylor'd Lighting)?
    
    I think it was about three weeks ago that the first one appeared, 
    surrounded by "Pavement Closed" signs - unfortunately you can't
    just arbitrarily close the pavement there, there is no other 
    route to walk in to St Margarets from many houses in the area.
    
    Just under a week after the hole appeared, on the Saturday, some 
    men arrived and did a bit more work.  Presumably they were not on 
    a good enough overtime rate, for they only did about half a day's
    work then disappeared.
 
    The following Saturday some more work was done and a further, much 
    bigger hole appeared.  The pavement was still "closed", those 
    of us with children had by then push some of the signs floating 
    around the area in to the road such that cars would be forced 
    to give us some space.
    
    Now after three weeks someone somewhere has seen some sense and 
    placed barriers to force the cars to move across and mark out 
    a proper pedestrian route around the holes � but there is no 
    sign of any work taking place in or around the holes at all.
    
    How much longer will they be there?  Are we just expected to put
    up with this ignorant behaviour by our utility companies?
    
       � Ed Randall

REVIEW: THE FIRST STONE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The First Stone is the first novel by a local man, Guido Casale.
    Guido has lived on the border of Old Isleworth and St Margarets 
    since 1983 and both of his daughters have passed through the St 
    Margarets schools, Orleans Infants and St Stephens.  Even though 
    the names have been changed, the book takes place entirely in and 
    around St Margarets.  All of the locations are 
    clearly recognisable.  
    
    The story itself is of two lives that become briefly intertwined
    a young girl and a criminal posing as a neighbour.  Their lives 
    have many strange parallels and they become dependant on each
    other for friendship.  The main plots are around a gold bullion
    robbery and the young girl's struggle with growing up despite some
    mental and psychological struggles.

    I highly recommend getting a copy.

    You can purchase the book at the new agents next 
    to the St Margarets Train Station.
