THE OLDEST INHABITANT - NOW
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    115 years ago, on June 26th 1897, a local paper, "The Richmond
    Herald" celebrated Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee by publishing
    an interview with the district's oldest inhabitant. His name was
    James Harbor, a boot maker, and he was 93 years old. To celebrate
    our own Queen's Diamond Jubilee here is an interview with one
    of today's oldest inhabitants. He is 102 years old and has been
    living in this area for the last 95 years.

    Sonny was born in Chiswick on 20th May 1910. When he was 7 he moved
    with his family to Byfield Road in Isleworth where he attended the
    Blue School. It was a world without central heating or indoor
    sanitation or electricity or free health care or a car on every

STRAWBERRY HILL HOUSE FESTIVAL UPDATES - 3 TO 4 JUNE 2012
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Don't forget the Jubilee Jazz Festival on 3 and 4 June 2012!

    The long range weather forecast is looking horrible... but don't
    worry, the performances all take place in a large chandelier lit
    marquee which has plenty of seating.

    On Sunday 3rd June Saxophonist Don Weller cannot appear due to ill
    health but he has been replaced by legendary saxophonist Peter
    King, who will also have copies of his newly
    published autobiography.

    Our Hospitality Village includes local Ales, chilled strawberry
    cider, speciality teas and cup cakes, a hog roast and BBQ,
    vegetarian and vegan Indian food. Also, a 7ft chocolate fountain!
    All locally sourced from our own local high quality and very
    individual businesses.

    There is also plenty of space to picnic in the beautiful grounds
    but we ask you not to bring alcohol as there is a festival bar.
