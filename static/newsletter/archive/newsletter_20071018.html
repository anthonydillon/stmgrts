<p><em>18 October 2007</em></p>

<p>Welcome to the St Margarets Community Website Newsletter (<a href="https://stmargarets.london">stmargarets.london</a>). Each Thursday we will send you the latest news and events from the website.</p>

<h2>Latest News</h2>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2007/10/event_reminder_the_burial_at_thebes.html">Event Reminder: The Burial at Thebes</a></h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/events/burial_at_thebes_thumb.jpg" width="150" height="112" alt="Burial at Thebes - Sue Baxter as Antigone and Michael Daly as Creon"  style="padding: 2px; border: 1px solid #ccc;" align="right"  /></p>

<p><strong>The State vs The Individual</strong> &#8212; <em>the eternal conflict</em></p>

<p>Next production from the Richmond Shakespeare Society is <a href="https://stmargarets.london/event/auction/200705141718">The Burial at Thebes</a>, Seamus Heaney&#8217;s 21st century translation of Sophocles&#8217; Antigone. His beautifully poetic translation transforms this 5th century BC classic into a modern delight which flows effortlessly into the mind.</p>

<p>The name Antigone means &#8220;one with the opposite view,&#8221; and her conflict with her uncle King Creon over her unburied brother is the pivot round which this timeless tragedy remorselessly develops.</p>

<p>The tensions between obligations to family and state, obedience to the gods and earthly powers, pose dilemmas for all involved. Heaney stays faithful to Sophocles&#8217; text, adding his own stylish touches and using familiar language to combine poetry and modern idiom in reviving an ancient masterpiece.</p>

<p>Director Stella Gheury de Bray says: &#8220;Heaney is one of our greatest-ever playwrights and a modern winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature. The play is full of evocative imagery in down-to-earth language, and although high tragedy, every character is true to life and believable.&#8221;</p>

<p>Performances are at 7.45pm on Saturday Oct 20th, Monday 22nd, Tuesday 23rd, and Thurs- Sat 24th -27th, matinees 4pm Sun 21st and 3pm Saturday 27th. Tickets &#163;7 or &#163;8, all performances non-smoking.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2007/10/event_reminder_big_band_blitz_2007.html">Event Reminder: Big Band Blitz 2007</a></h3>

<p>Friends of the Museum of Richmond will be the benefiting charity from the popular annual 1940&#8217;s <a href="https://stmargarets.london/event/show/200705141717">Big Band Blitz</a> at York House, Twickenham on Saturday 10 November 2007.</p>

<p>The Deputy Mayor of Richmond and her guests will step back in time to the 1940s.  Big Band Blitz 2007, produced by Aspects Productions, will again re-create a special 1940&#8217;s Glenn Miller wartime evening of big band music, dance and entertainment, featuring the legendary music of Glenn Miller and other Big Bands of the period.</p>

<p>The authentic setting with 1940&#8217;s Period Dress and Memorabilia, Live Music and Celebrity Guests, Dancing, Food and Drink from the NAAFI, Licensed Bar, the Air-Raid Warning, and Spam, will make this a unique 1940&#8217;s party, and enable guests to experience the atmosphere of those bygone days.</p>

<p>This special event will feature the critically acclaimed Jon Bennett Big Band, whose many credits include appearances at the Savoy Hotel, Australian High Commission, the Lyceum and Dominion Theatres in London&#8217;s West End, and the Royal Gala Performance at Richmond Theatre.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2007/10/a_friday_in_jerusalem_during_ramadan.html">A Friday in Jerusalem during Ramadan</a></h3>

<div class="box"><em>This is the second dispatch from Gill Swain, a local writer who has <a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2007/09/local_writer_works_for_peace_in_palestine.html">traveled to Palestine</a> to work for peace with the World Council of Churches </em>.</div>


<p>Hundreds of thousands of Muslims pile out of a multitude of buses, crowd through three ancient gates in the walls of the Old City of Jerusalem and squeeze along a few selected lanes leading to the Al Aqsa mosque.</p>

<p>It is a Friday morning during the holy month of Ramadan and for hours the astonishing flow of humanity surges through three or four  narrow streets, directed by groups of Israeli soldiers standing watchful on every corner. There is a loud clamour of voices, insistent music blares from the market stalls, people are pushing and jostling and batting away the merchandise which dangles in their faces as they hurry to their prayers.</p>

<p>They have come from every corner of Israeli-occupied West Bank, around 300,000 of them. Many have been on the road since 4am to give them enough time to negotiate the maze of barriers and checkpoints which strangles the internal transport system for Palestinians.</p>

<p>The Al Aqsa mosque is built on Al-Haram Ash-Sharif, also known as the Temple Mount, near the spot from which it is believed the prophet Mohamed rose to heaven, and it is a religious requirement for every Muslim to pray there at least once during Ramadan. I join the eager throng for a while and soon I begin to notice something.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2007/10/frogs_in_hartington_road.html">Frogs in Hartington Road</a></h3>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;I wonder if anyone could help here. We live at the school end of Hartington Road and our cats are wont to bring (usually live) frogs into the house. In the past I&#137;&Ucirc;&ordf;ve carried them to the school, thinking that they&#137;&Ucirc;&ordf;ve probably come from the pond there, but now that pond has gone and the frogs are still coming! Could anyone suggest where the best place is for us to repatriate these amphibians?</p>

<p>Many thanks.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
