OLD NEW YEAR

TWICKENHAM ENTERS THE HISTORY BOOKS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Twickenham has been designated one of the country's 100 most
    important historical places. Not, as you would expect from Hampton
    Court Palace or Marble Hill House or even the Turner House,
    but because of the Twickenham rugby stadium.

OVERSEAS STUDENTS BRING MILLIONS TO TWICKENHAM
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    A recent study by London Economics has shown that Britain benefits
    to the tune of 25bn pounds a year from overseas students; London
    by &pound;4.6bn and Twickenham - which hosts St Mary's University -
    by an estimated 43 million pounds, equivalent to 382 pounds
    per resident.
