DR WHO AND VINCENT VAN GOGH
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Most people in St. Margarets already know that Vincent van Gogh
    was once a near neighbour of ours. It is heartening to see that 
    "the greatest painter who ever lived" has conquered time and
    space and is now fighting aliens with Dr. Who and his travelling
    companion Amy Pond (mmmmmm - Amy Pond!).
    
      Starry, starry night.
      Paint your palette blue and grey,
      Look out on a summer's day,
      With eyes that know the darkness in my soul.
      Shadows on the hills,
      Sketch the trees and the daffodils,
      Catch the breeze and the winter chills,
      In colors on the snowy linen land.
      
      - "Vincent" by Don McLean

    Vincent Willem van Gogh was born on 30 March 1853 in Groot-Zundert,
    a village in the province of North Brabant in the southern 
    Netherlands. He was the son of Anna Cornelia Carbentus and Theodorus 
    van Gogh, a minister of the Dutch Reformed Church. As a child he
    suffered from bouts of anxiety and depression. As a result he
    had a miserable childhood as he revealed in a letter to his
    brother Theo in 1883...
