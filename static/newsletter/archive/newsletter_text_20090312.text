THE THREE CHORD TRICK EXPLAINED
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    "If you play more than two chords, you're showing off."
    -- Woody Guthrie

    Back in the good old days when TV was black and white, records
    were mono and you could buy a Mars Bar, a Kit Kat and the latest
    Dickie Valentine single and still get change from a  'ten bob note'
    young men with a sense of destiny were teaching themselves to play
    the guitar. Everyone was doing it. Those who knew about these 
    things said the guitar was an iconic symbol of the rise 
    of the teenager.
    
    By 1956 the days of tuxedoed band leaders, crisply coiffured 
    crooners and lady singers wearing 'sticky out' bras and enough 
    petticoat silk to equip a platoon of parachutists were fast
    disappearing. Instead our radios and televisions were being taken
    over by tartan shirted, guitar strumming ravers all bashing out 
    the latest craze - Skiffle - and as everyone knew it didn't take
    much to join them. The role model was Lonnie Donegan and the 
    guru was Bert Weedon who in his 'teach yourself tutor' promised
    that you could learn to play the guitar in a day. No needs 
    for lessons, complicated scales, reading the 'dots' or musical
    theory. You could buy yourself a guitar on Monday (15 pounds cash 
    or 6/11d a week for 52 weeks), teach yourself to play on Tuesday,
    form a band on Wednesday, play your first 'gig' on Thursday, 
    cut a record on Friday, see it go into the Top Ten on Saturday
    - and on Sunday? Well, then you top the bill on ITV's most 
    popular show "Sunday Night at the London Palladium" of course.
    
    The secret behind all this instant fame was the "Three Chord 
    Trick". All you needed to learn was just 3 chords - and you did 
    that by copying the chord diagrams in Bert Weedon's teach 
    yourself tutor.1  With these you could strum alone with most
    folk, country, rock 'n' roll and blues songs, 97% of the skiffle 
    repertoire and virtually everything recorded by Chuck Berry, 
    Buddy Holly, Gene Vincent, Eddie Cochran or any other teen idol
    whose name ended with a 'Y' - as in 'Billy', 'Tommy', 'Ricky'
    or Ray. Throw in a 4th chord - a minor - and you could add 
    doo-wop and most teen ballads to the list. After just 24 hours
    of finger busting persistence the entire teen music scene was 
    yours to play.

OPEN INVITATION TO COMMUKNITY

    is on Monday 16th March from 8pm.

EVENT REMINDER: 2x2 OPERA'S ROBINSON CRUSOE

    Conductor of the National Youth Choirs of Great Britain to 
    conduct, assisted by Dominic Peckham, also from the NYC.  We 
    are joined by professional singers Michael Davis who some may

    Jane Dale, and Harry Bagnall.
    
    Local resident and TV producer Keith Cheetham directs 
    this new adaptation.

MINUTES: POLICE LIAISON GROUP PUBLIC MEETING - 19 FEBRUARY 2009
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Dr Atton opened the meeting by reminding everyone that its purpose 
    is to support and guide the police and act as a bridge between 
    the community and the police.
    
    She then mentioned the police guidelines about to come into force
    (in March) on directing people to leave localities. This is a new
    way to combat alcohol-related crimes or disorder.
    
    As Dr Atton is leaving the locality, she tendered her resignation.
    Cllr Ben Khosa will stay on as Vice-Chair. The role of Secretary 
    is also vacant.

POLE2POLE NORDIC WALKING
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Pole2Pole Nordic Walking started in November 2008.  It has become
    more and more popular with people in West London because of our
    beautiful riverside walkways and parks.
    
    The all inclusive whole body workout, Nordic Walking, is the 
    fastest growing sport in the UK.  It is an efficient, low-stress,
    holistic exercise that involves the use of specially designed 
    poles which are supplied at all sessions.  Over 8 million people
    are now experiencing the positive effects of this hugely social 
    activity throughout Europe. It requires the correct technique 
    in order to incorporate 90% of your skeletal muscles, to increase
    the calories burned and help you tone up and get fit. Nordic 
    Walking is the ideal way for people of all ages and fitness levels
    to get outdoors and keep active.
    
    Kay Speakman is a qualified Nordic Walking UK Instructor. She is
    properly qualified and insured to deliver a safe and exciting
    outdoor experience.
