<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2009/07/dont_miss_the_31st_annual_st_margarets_fair.html">Don&#39;t Miss the 31st Annual St Margarets Fair</a></h3>

<p><img src="http://www.stmargaretsfair.org/images/SMFLogo180.gif" height="150" width="150" align="right"/></p>

<p><em>This year the Fair will be on Saturday 11<sup>th</sup> July starting at 12.00</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.stmargaretsfair.org/images/smf_map09.pdf">Here is a map of the fairground (pdf).</a></p>

<p>There will be a <a href="http://www.stmargaretsfair.org/pages/schedule.html">full programme</a> of  entertainment throughout the day, starting with a popular children&#8217;s  &#8216;5-a-side&#8217; <a href="http://www.stmargaretsfair.org/pages/football.html">football</a> tournament in the  morning on Moormead.


<p>During the afternoon there is a <a href="http://www.stmargaretsfair.org/pages/dogshow.html">dog show</a>  on little Moormead across Hillview Road.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.stmargaretsfair.org/pages/music.html">musical</a> entertainment will run all  afternoon on the stage, and we&#8217;re moving the stage further  away from the tea tent to help separate the &#8216;rock&#8217; from the rolls.</p>

<p>There will be announcements, interviews and music throughout the  day from <a href="http://www.radiowestmiddlesex.org.uk/">Radio West  Middlesex</a>.</p>

<p>The fair organisers run the Tea Tent,  Beer Tent, Pimms  Stall, Greek Food, the <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">BBQ,  </span></span></span>the Bric-a-brac stall, a Plant  stall, the Silent Auction, and the  Coconut Shy.</p>

<p>All profits from these stalls go direct to our charities - please  support these stalls. Look on our plan of the <a href="http://www.stmargaretsfair.org/pages/../images/smf_map09.pdf" target="_blank">fair  ground</a> to find where they are.

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2009/07/the_ghost_buster_from_st_margarets.html">The Ghost Buster from St Margarets</a></h3>

<p><img src="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/mask_cook_poster-thumb.jpg" width="106" height="150" alt="MASKELYNE AND COOKE' THEATRE POSTER"  align="right" style="padding:2px;border: 1px solid #ccc;" /></a></p>

<p>In 1864 a 25 year old Cheltenham watchmaker called John Nevil Maskelyne was visited by an American gentleman with a piece of &#8216;apparatus&#8217; that needed attention. Its only apparent purpose was to make rapping noises on the underside of tables. The stranger paid well for the work and when he left he said to Maskelyne&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;I&#8217;m sure a smart young fellow like you could use the loose change. And in return, just forget you ever saw me.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>Maskelyne, a talented conjurer who had built many of his own mechanical illusions, was immediately suspicious.  Ever since 1848 when the Fox Sisters in America claimed communication with the dead through table rapping and automatic writing the entire world had become obsessed by Spiritualism. Endorsed by establishment figures like the scientist Sir William Crookes and the writer Sir Alfred Conan Doyle &#8216;psychic mediums&#8217; were appearing in droves to satisfy the public interest. Theatrical displays of levitation, ghosts, disembodied voices and telekinesis had become commonplace &#8212; and profitable too. Illusionists and conjurers like Maskelyne suspected fraud.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/kumon-thumb.jpg" width="150" height="112" alt="students with their awards"  align="right" style="padding:2px;border: 1px solid #ccc;" /></a></p>

<p>On 25<sup>th</sup> of June 2009 at the St Margarets Catholic Church local students from the <a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/directory/school/200709280322">Kumon St Margarets Centre</a> gained recognition for their success and continued development studying on the Kumon maths and/or English programmes.  The committed students were presented with awards at a ceremony to celebrate their achievement of mastering maths and English beyond their current school level.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2009/07/the_marathon_de_sables_equipment.html">The Marathon de Sables: Equipment</a></h3>

<p>After much sourcing and reading about the MdS, I have finally found a rucksack that I can use for the race. Having worked out that there are a few models that people tend to use, I spoke to Mike at <em>Likely</em> who was brilliant. He suggested that I use a rucksack from <a href="http://www.aarnpacks.com/">aarn</a> which fits all. The pack although complicated, is great and provides me with sufficient storage space to run with all the necessary equipment. It has two front pockets which are superb and each compartment will happily take a litre of water. Mike has used this type of rucksack running in the Gobi desert, so it seems suitable. Unfortunately the rucksack I was using previously has rubbed on my back, which is really common. I&#8217;ll need to rest it over the next week or so to help it heal.</p>

<p><em>Help <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">FRODO </span></span></span>and enter the <a href="http://www.thelondonduathlon.com/">London Duathlon this 13<sup>th</sup> September in Richmond Park.</a></em></p>

<p>Thank you to all those who have supported the St Margarets for <a href="http://www.frodokids.org"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">FRODO</span></span></span></a> campaign, from buying the cakes and the clothes to taking part in the London Duathlon.  We are well on the way to raising the &#163;25,000 to send a team of doctors from Gt Ormond St to Romania to treat 50 plus disabled and orphaned children.  Last year a team from St Margarets took part in the London Duathlon, raising over &#163;5,000.</p>

<p>This year we want to get the largest charity team together to see if we can double it.  We would love anyone who can run 5k, or cycle to come and join us.  It is also a great day out for the family.</p>

<p>To join or find out more please call Claire Wilson on 020 8744 0700.</p>

<p>On Sunday, 5<sup>th</sup> July 2009, around 300 members of St Stephen&#8217;s Church East Twickenham spent the day volunteering as part of an initiative called <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">HOPE</span></span></span> 09.  The initiative, which first began in July 2008, aims to bring &#8220;hope&#8221; to the local community by undertaking practical projects for individuals in need, organisations and local charities as well as carrying out random acts of kindness.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2009/07/take_the_st_margarets_alliance_survey.html">Take the St Margarets Alliance Survey</a></h3>

<div class="box">

<p><img src="http://www.stmargaretsalliance.com/imgs/logo1.jpg" alt="St Margarets Alliance" width="169" height="188" align="right" /></p>

<p>The St Margarets Alliance is <a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/sma_survey">asking all residents to complete a survey</a> as the first stage towards creating a Community Action Plan.  The Survey asks residents to consider which aspects of their local environment, economy, or social well-being are most important to them and to prioritise the most important and urgent.</p>

<p>Community Action Plans are central to the Sustainable Communities Act (SCA) of 2007, which aims to create a more local form of democracy.  The Plans are approved by the Secretary of State and funded from central government and community funds.  As such, Community Action Plans help communities to shape their economic, social and environmental well-being.</p>

<p><em>The group is non party-political and its purpose is to coordinate a Community Action Plan for the area. St Margarets Alliance does not have a specific agenda for the St Margarets area: the results of the Survey will form the basis for the basis of all future initiatives.  The group&#8217;s guiding principle is &#8216;residents first&#8217;.</em></p>
