    Learning is the first and only Soil Association, certified nursery

    at the back.

WINE BAR GETS CONDITIONAL PLANNING PERMISSION
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    On 2nd March 2006, the Richmond Council Planning Committee Meeting
    gave 'conditional permission' for the proposed wine bar in the 
    basement formerly occupied by Phelps.
    
    The meeting was held before a completely full room. After speakers
    for both sides, councillor questions and planning's advice, the
    application was conditionally approved by a 5-3 vote, with local 
    councillors Cllr Hambidge supporting and Cllrs Lamb and Trigg 
    (Twickenham Riverside) against. The 'conditions' are that; a 
    Travel Plan is agreed, Air Conditioning plans are approved, only
    a 2am New Year's license is given and only 'personal permission'
    is given.
    
    Personal Permission, meaning that planning permission is only 
    given to one of the principles of the wine bar and if they leave 
    the venture for any reason, the new owner would have to get 
    another planning approval, is considered a protection against 
    the sale or change of the venue into something else, but also a 
    potentially tough limit to the applicants, making it harder for 
    them to raise money.

MOORMEAD PARK MEETING
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Following on from the original meeting, another meeting of 
    interested residents and groups is being called for Thursday, 
    9 March at 7.30pm in the Turks' Head, Winchester Hall.
    
    The purpose of the meeting is to agree the key areas for 
    refurbishment, begin the process of looking at fund-raising ideas 
    for supporting these, in partnership with the Council and are 
    hoping to form a representative local group -- 
    Friends of Moormead Park.
    
    Anyone interested in being involved in the discussion, and in 
    particular the fundraising, please let Claire Wilson know; email
    corpunit@aol.com or call 020 8744 0700.
