RICHMOND COUNCIL'S CCTV PARKING & TRAFFIC PLANS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    St Margarets is about to get two new tools in fighting 
    irresponsibly motorists.  the first is the two month trial of a new 
    high-tech car fitted with a CCTV camera on a periscope.  The 
    specially modified Smart car will target known hotspots, homing in
    on motorists parking on pavements and illegally parking around 
    schools and pedestrian crossings.
    
    It will also be called to enforce traffic and parking restrictions 
    on rugby match days around Twickenham Stadium.  Motorists caught 
    flouting the rules will be issued with a fixed penalty notice.  
    The cars are already being used by Westminster, Enfield, Camden
    and Islington Councils and have proved effective in improving
    pedestrian safety and reducing traffic accidents and congestion.
    
    Councillor David Trigg, Cabinet Member for Traffic, Transport and 
    Parking, said:
    
        "Indiscriminate parking around schools and pedestrian 
         crossings is highly irresponsible and poses a real 
         danger to pedestrians.
         
        "This new technology will enable us to focus on problem
         areas quickly and efficiently, in a way that parking 
         attendants are unable to do."
         
     Additionally, the CCTV camera on the mast, next to Broadway Stores
     will become operational from 1st April for monitoring the Tesco
     loading bay area, resulting in increased issue of fixed penalty
     notice to any offending parkers.

READER APPEAL: REPORT NOISY PLANES
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
        "I would like to let the people of St Margarets know 
         that if, like me, they get woken up at night by aircraft
         noises landing at Heathrow it is possible to send 
         a complaint about it to BAA and Richmond council. 
         Have a look at this Council webpage and email or 
         call them to let them know that the noise of aeroplanes 
         landing at 4 am wakes you up.  If nobody lets them
         know then they won't write it in their reports 
         and they will assume everything is OK."
         
         
         -- from Armelle, a sleep deprived resident living on Moor Mead road

READER APPEAL: THE BARONS ROAD
----------------------------------------------------------------------
        "The road surface in The Barons is in very bad condition 
        and is once again pock marked where the surface has been
        peeled off.  It dangerous for cylcists like myself.
        
        The road has never been re-surfaced in over 15 years.  
        They patch it and the patches come off.  It looks horrible.
        
        I've asked Richmond Council a number of times to schedure a
        re-surface but they say '... no money'.
        
        I have once again asked for their help.
        
        Can I ask through your Newsletter that other Barons 
        residents, who feel the same, please report the problem 
        to Richmond Council?"

    The Your Pharmacy at 38 Crown Road has applied for planning

OUTRAGE AT ST STEPHENS FOR MOORMEAD FEES
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Richmond Council has decided to increase what it charges
    St Stephens C.E. Junior School to use Moormead park from {L-}450 per
    term to {L-}1,600 per term  (down from an amazing original {L-}2,400 per
    term increase).
    
    Currently the school is refusing to play.
    
    A group of parents at St Stephens is organising a petition against 
    the council's outrageous 356% increase.  The petition is outside
    the school's office and in the playground after school during 
    pick-up time.
    
    What do you think?
