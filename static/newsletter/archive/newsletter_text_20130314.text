THE STATUE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Local cartophiles1 and others with a damp afternoon and nothing
    else to do will be interested to learn that the small slice
    of paradise that we call home sits within four church parishes - St
    Mary's to the south, St Stephens to the east, All Hallows to the
    west and the gloriously named St Margarets-on-Thames to the north.

LOCAL JOB VACANCIES: FOREST SCHOOL LEADER AND ASSISTANT - WILD EDUCATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Wild Education is a new Forest School working with local primary
    schools in Orleans House Gallery woods

    Forest School is an ethos of education encouraging child led
    learning in a natural environment. Research shows that children
    generally learn more effectively in the outdoors, gain in
    confidence and self esteem, are more balanced, more able
    to concentrate, show more consideration to others, greater social
    capability and better coordination. They are learning in a
    pleasant, natural, fun and less stressful environment with a wealth
    of opportunities to suit all learning styles.

    I am currently looking to recruit and I particularly need someone
    to assist in an after school club on a Monday and/or Wednesday
    from 3.15 to 5.30.

TRAG GETS PERMISSION TO APPEAL TWICKENHAM STATION DEVELOPMENT
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    We are delighted to report that the Court of Appeal has given TRAG
    permission to appeal against the judgment of the High Court
    in favour of the Council's decision to approve Solum Regeneration's
    high rise scheme for the redevelopment of Twickenham Station. Lord
    Justice Sullivan declared that he believes one of the grounds
    within our overall appeal argument "has a real prospect of
    success".

    Recent soundings amongst earlier donors have clearly shown that the
    Twickenham community continues to be supportive of our campaign and
    are prepared to put in more funding. It is worth restating how
    broad this support is: amongst the circa 400 residents who backed
    TRAG's recent fund raising drive, 73% live well beyond the vicinity
    of the station. This wider Twickenham community clearly wants to
    see a Council which adheres to its declared manifesto and its
    recent policy statements, much trumpeted in the rhetoric of the
    Council leadership, that there will be no more top-down politics.
    It really is about time that the Council, and also the RFU, got the
    message that the Twickenham community is in no way supportive of
    the Solum scheme and remains very angry about the decision to grant
    approval made on 19 December 2011.

    TRAG's objective remains to encourage a low rise station
    redevelopment that is consistent with the Council's own planning
    policy and is fit for purpose. There is probably still time to
    build such a station before the Rugby World Cup 2015, but there is
    certainly not enough time to build one that is financially
    dependent on erecting and marketing a huge residential tower
    block first.

    We shall require additional funding to meet the costs of a full
    scale appeal and are in the process of engaging with our supporters
    to ensure we meet the necessary target in time. However, the
    encouragement of the Court of Appeal's decision and the fact that
    any costs of "the other side" are limited to 5,000 augur well
    for our capacity to raise the necessary funding and overturn this
    disastrous planning decision. pounds

TURING HOUSE SCHOOL APPLICATION PROGRESSING
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    The Turing House School is a proposed Free School that is seeking
    funding to create a new secondary school. Their preferred site is
    Building 2 at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), which
    overlooks the NPL Sports Ground in Teddington.

    Representatives of the Turing House Steering Group were at the
    Department for Education today, to be interviewed about their free
    school proposal.

    Local parents Beverley Sanders and Janet Hilton were joined by
    Karen Lynch and Colin Mackinlay from the Russell Education Trust,
    for the 90 minute discussion with DfE officials.

    The interview forms part of the assessment process for the group's
    detailed plan for an 11-18 Secondary School, to serve the Middlesex
    side of Richmond Borough from 2014, and an approval decision is
    anticipated in May.
