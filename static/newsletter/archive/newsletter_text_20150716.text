Welcome to the St Margarets Community Website Newsletter. 
Each Thursday we will send you the latest news and events from the website (http://www.stmgrts.org.uk).

===========================================================



ï»¿HEY HO! COME TO THE FAIR
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    "This is the time of the year when St Margarets empties out and
    turns into a ghost town..."

    Overheard at the St Margarets Fair - Saturday 11th July 2015

    The speaker was right. Over the next few weeks St Margarets will
    turn into a ghost town. Parking will be easier, trains less crowded
    and our streets empty with most of the school children away on
    their holidays -- unless of course you live in Surrey where the
    schools don't break up until the 21st July. This is summer and a
    time for frivolity, fun and fairs.

    There have been at least four major neighbourhood fairs in the
    district over the last week or two. First the Twickenham Green Fair
    on the 5th July, then the St Margarets and Barnes Fairs on the 11th
    and then the Strawberry Hill Music and Fun Day on the 12th. The mix
    is usually the same... bouncy castles, food stalls, bric-a-brac and
    live music. The St Margarets Fair -- always a pace setter -- even
    had a Dog Show, a Karate demonstration and a Soap Box Derby. The
    sun shines some of the time and people enjoy themselves most of the
    time and communities bind themselves together to raise money
    for charity -- but it wasn't always so.

EVENT REMINDER: SHAKESPEARE IN THE GARDEN - 8 TO 9 SEPTEMBER 2015
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    We're not just famous for rugby - this Summer, Shakespeare in the
    Garden is back at the Turk's Head. Permanently Bard presents "Romeo
    & Juliet" - the greatest love story ever told.

    See a different side to the Turk's Head this Summer, with two
    magical evenings which will welcome, surprise and delight you. What
    better place to enjoy Shakespeare's best loved tragedy than with a
    pint or your favourite glass of wine in our fantastic beer garden.
    We've been hard at work preparing two amazing menus (will you pick
    Montague or Capulet?) for you - so book in now for 2 or 3 courses
    of pre-theatre dinner!

TWICKENHAM VOTES FOR A LIDO ON TWICKENHAM RIVERSIDE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    During consultations with local stakeholders it has become clear
    that there is a wish to bring back a Lido on Twickenham Riverside.
    Twickenham Alive has identified a successful "courtyard" style lido
    in Bristol which would fit into the site available.

    The success and popularity of the Lido in Bristol has given the
    Bristol Lido the confidence to invest in a second Lido in Reading.
    The Bristol Lido concept is a proven financial success which would
    ensure the long term future and sustainability of the facility.
    More importantly though, it provides the local people with an
    everyday escape from modern life, an accessible urban retreat. The
    Richmond Card would be welcome at the lido and spa.

EVENT REMINDER: SUMMER FAMILY WORKSHOPS - GARDENS THROUGH TIME
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Events every day from 10 to noon from Tuesday 28th July 2015
    to Friday 31st July 2015.

    The Museum of Richmond is thrilled to announce that its Summer
    Family Workshops will be on the theme; GARDENS THROUGH TIME. This
    will complement our 'Feeding London; the forgotten market gardens'
    exhibition which runs at the museum until September 1st.

    The session will include families learning about the history
    of garden design through images and discussion. Why did the Tudors
    favour the knot gardens? How did the Georgians influence garden
    designs across Europe?
