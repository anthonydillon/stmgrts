TESCO, STOP PUSHING AROUND ST MARGARETS
-----------------------------------------------------------
    A local group called SPASM (for Stop Pushing Around St Margarets)
    has been actively campaigning to make local Tesco conform with
    existing regulations and making sure the Richmond Council doesn't
    pander to the retail giant's whims unfairly.

THE TWICHENHAM CHALLENGE
-----------------------------------------------------------
    The regeneration of the Twickenham Riverside is well under way
    with Stage 1 offically completed on 1 June with the opening of
    the Jubilee Gardens, a playground and a soon to be opened Caf√©.

    The second Stage is titled "The Twickenham Challenge".  The
    Council is working with local and national groups to develop
    proposals for self-sustaining facilities, representing 15-20%
    of the total space of the site.  The goal is for the Council to
    review and approve plans by this summer.

ST MARGARETS BLOSSOMS
-----------------------------------------------------------
    After several months of planning and negotiations hanging baskets
    have finally arrived in St. Margarets Road and Crown Road. The
    baskets have been organised by the St. Margarets Traders'
    Association working in partnership with Richmond in Bloom. Funding
    for the baskets was helped through the Richmond Council's excellent
    Civic Pride scheme.
