LATEST NEWS
===========================================================



ï»¿HOUNSLOW SWORDS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Once upon a time, long before estate agents roamed the earth; when
    Michael Gove was just a figment of our imagination, this blessed
    plot of ours was noted for many things like wheat, fruit, pottery,
    fish, beer, gunpowder and surprisingly - swords. It is recorded
    that in the late 16th century, during the reign of Elizabeth 1st,
    those who wished to rent land near the Rivers Colne and Crane
    for the construction of gunpowder mills had to pay the Government a
    rent of 1000 swords... which sounds a little cut throat to me!

EVENT REMINDER: TASTING WITH LES CAVES DE PYRENE - 10 APRIL 2014
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    "The Real Wine Month" is a nationwide promotion highlighting
    organic, biodynamic and natural wines made by artisan growers
    and winemakers.

    From Cheshire to Cornwall and the Orkneys to Oxfordshire and
    in Ireland and Wales, organic, biodynamic and natural wines will be
    promoted throughout April in over 200 restaurants, independent
    merchants and wholesalers.

    We will be celebrating The Real Wine Month showcasing our extensive
    'Rea'l or 'Natural' wine selection.

    We are also delighted to be hosting an event with Les Caves de
    Pyrene on Thursday 10 March 2014. Our friend, Phil Barnet, will be
    back with more great wines and conversation. You will be able to
    try a number of new and existing 'Natural Wines' from our range,
    as well as finding out more about each wine and what goes in
    to making a 'natural' or 'real' wine.

EVENT REMINDER: PLAY - MEN AT ARMS - 3 TO 5 APRIL 2014
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    'Be a MAN in the City Watch! The City Watch needs MEN!'

    But what it's got includes Corporal Carrot (technically a dwarf),
    Lance-constable Cuddy (really a dwarf), Lance constable Detritus (a
    troll), Lance constable Angua (a woman... most of the time) and
    Corporal Nobbs (disqualified from the human race for shoving). And
    they need all the help they can get. Because they've only got
    twenty-four hours to clean up the town and this is Ankh-Morpork
    we're talking about...

    Another wild romp through Discworld! Corporal Carrot, a young
    dwarf, is newly in charge of the recruits guarding Ankh-Morpork.
    Edward, the 37th Lord d'Eath, has just discovered that
    Ankh-Morpork, kingless for generations, has a sovereign ruler, who
    must be convinced that he is, in fact, the King. The fate
    of Ankh-Morpork rides on a young man's courage, an unlikely
    alliance between a dwarf and a troll and the watch understanding
    the importance of a clown's real nose.
