EVENT REMINDER: THE JAZZ SHOWCASE - BACK TO THE RISING SUN!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Rising Sun reopens this Friday - new coat of paint, new
    landlord, stuffed camels in storage but otherwise the same.

    Coincidentally a neighbour pointed out to Pete the landlord
    at the Crown that their music licence only covered Thursdays
    through Saturday so as of this Monday 23rd June we are back
    at the Rising Sun starting soon after 8.00. (Leaving time
    to blow the plaster dust out of the piano).

    The Jazz Showcase's house band as always will be Ian Anderson
    on piano, Jeremy Holroyd on drums and Roger Perrin
    on double bass.

    As a special treat we hope to have Sarah Ellen Hughes singing
    with us this Monday.

    Sarah has been the principal singer with the National Youth Jazz
    Orchestra for the last three years and has appeared with NYJO
    at the Pizza Express Dean Street, Ronnie Scotts and The Stables
    at Wavendon and now has a residency at Pizza on the Park
    on the first Wednesday of each month.

    Admission is free

THE CRANE RIVER BLUES
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    If you're one of those happy souls who likes to remember important
    dates in social history here's one to add to your list - July 13th
    1954 when -- just up the road from where you are reading this -- the
    fuse was lit on the great British pop music explosion!

    The story starts in 1948 when Ken Colyer, an amateur musician
    living in Hounslow, put together a band to play the old time jazz
    music of New Orleans. As they had been rehearsing in Cranford
    on the banks of the River Crane they called themselves the Crane
    River Jazz Band  - and took the jazz standard 'Down by the
    Riverside' as their theme tune.  By the summer of 1949
    "The Cranes" were confident enough to start their own jazz club
    in the White Hart pub in Cranford. It was an immediate success.
    True to the spirit of old New Orleans instead of playing records
    during the interval Ken bashed out American folk songs
    on a guitar, accompanied by kazoo, washboard and double bass.

    In 1952 Ken Colyer decided to make a pilgrimage to New Orleans
    to check out his favourite music at first hand. In his absence
    two of the former 'Cranes' - clarinettist Monty Sunshine and
    guitarist/banjo player Tony 'Lonnie' Donegan started a new band
    with trombonist Chris Barber. Hoping that Ken would join them
    on his return they continued with Ken's popular 'guitar and
    washboard' interval sessions.  But Ken wasn't coming back so
    quickly. He was locked up in New Orleans for not having a work
    permit!
