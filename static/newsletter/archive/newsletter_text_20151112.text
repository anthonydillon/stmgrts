    Portugal may be an often over-looked corner of Europe but in its
    time it has given us some wonderful things. Ask anybody and they
    will tell you...

    "Ah! Portugal!... Port comes from Portugal...
     I like a drop of port.

     Um... some great football clubs like Sporting CP and Benefica... 
     oooh... and F C Porto.

     The Algarve. My sister went there last year. Doesn't Cliff have a
     villa down there?

     Er... ... ... Explorers like Vasco Da Gama and whatisname... you 
     know... Christopher Columbus. He was Portuguese, wasn't he?
     (No. He was Italian!)

     O.K... now let me see... . (and finally and inevitably)... Jose
     Mourinho! He is Portuguese, isn't he? (Yes he is.)

PLEASE HELP COMMEMORATE THE ST MARGARETS BELGIAN COMMUNITY OF 1914-18
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    One day left to donate

    St Margarets has a unique WWI history! We gave a home in 1914-18
    to a massive Belgian refugee community, the largest in Southern
    England, and our towns developed a real Belgian character. We were
    called "The Belgian Village on the Thames". We want to celebrate
    our Belgian connection with a memorial at the place where most
    of the Belgians worked. This is not about war, but
    international friendship.

    The Richmond and Twickenham Belgian Refugee Memorial Fund has been
    opened by the East Twickenham Centennial Group, a voluntary group
    set up to commemorate Richmond and Twickenham's Belgian Refugees.
    East Twickenham was the focus of the Belgian community, as most
    of the refugees worked here in a Belgian munitions factory
    beside the river.

    They need 8400 pounds for the memorial, on top of our 5000 pounds
    grant from Richmond Council.

EVENT REMINDER: AIR COMMODORE CHARLES CLARKE OBE AND PADDY O'CONNELL IN CONVERSATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Charles Clarke was shot down over Germany and imprisoned in Stalag
    Luft III, the camp from which 76 prisoners tunnelled out in the
    "Great Escape". He later took part in the 'long march' of British
    PoWs across Germany in the last months of the Third Reich. After
    the war, he stayed in the RAF, reaching the rank of Air Commodore,
    continuing to work full time until 1998.
