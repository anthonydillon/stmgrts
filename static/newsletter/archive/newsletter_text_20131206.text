THE HAPPIEST OF MEN
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    "My body light, my figure slim,
     My mind dispos'd to mirth and whim."
     - RICHARD OWEN CAMBRIDGE

    You know where you are when you stray into Cambridge Park. Along
    with Cambridge Park itself there's Cambridge Gardens, Cambridge
    Road, Cambridge Mansions and Cambridge Park Court plus assorted
    odds and ends like Cambridge Park Footpath and Cambridge Park Bowls
    Club. Tucked away in a quiet corner of East Twickenham they all
    take their name from a house and an estate once owned by the poet,
    satirist and friend of the famous, Richard Owen Cambridge.
    Described as "the happiest of men - unencumbered by rank and easy
    in fortune" and "a 'beau ideal' of a thorough English gentleman,"
    Cambridge was "a font of benevolent wit."
