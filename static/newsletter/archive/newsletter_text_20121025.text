NEW: ART WORKSHOPS FOR KIDS AND PARENTS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Monthly art workshops with local artist Anna De Polnay. Each
    workshop has a different theme: Halloween, Christmas and fairy
    tales to name a few. A fantastic opportunity for mums, dads,
    grandparents and kids to create individual or collaborative art in
    a fun and informal atmosphere.

    Anna de Polnay has been creating art in St Margarets for many
    years. With her assistant Emma Charlton she helps parents and kids
    create, learn, experiment and have fun together. Why let the kids
    have all the fun? Come and discover your arty side!

JUDICIAL REVIEW FOR TWICKENHAM STATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    More trouble for the Twickenham Station plans.

    Based on the tireless work of the Twickenham Residents Action
    Group, there will be a High Court Judicial Review regarding the
    Richmond Council approved plans to redevelop Twickenham Station.

    We have included the Council and the TRAG's press releases to let
    you figure out if it is horrible or wonderful news.

    Currently the St Margarets Community Website is wondering if the 10
    car extensions of St Margarets and Twickenham Station platforms
    causes the two stations to actually touch, whether that means St
    Margarets will move into Zone 5?
