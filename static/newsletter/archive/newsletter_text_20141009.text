LATEST NEWS
===========================================================



ï»¿NORTH ST MARGARETS REMEMBERS - TWO EVENTS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Two local events in St Margarets commemorating the 1st World War

    Our memories of the 1st World War and the men and women who lived
    through it are fixed in bronze statues, names carved in wood and
    stone, elegaic music, first-hand memoirs and poetry by the likes
    of Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen. Somewhere along the line we
    seem to have forgotten that most of those who took part in that
    terrible conflict were just like us, living in the same houses that
    we still live in, walking the same streets as us and sharing the
    same hopes and aspirations.

    Six years ago the North St Margarets Residents Association (NSMRA)
    started a project to find out what it could of the 86 local men
    recorded on the Roll of Honour in our neighbourhood church, All
    Souls Church in Northcote Road. You can read the initial results
    in an earlier article Two Crosses - 4 November 2008

    That research has evolved into two forthcoming events commemorating
    the Great War and re-establishing a link between those from our
    community who were directly involved and us, the present occupants
    of the neighbourhood who have taken their place.

UPCOMING YOGA FITNESS CLASSES - AUTUMN 2014
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Autumn is the season of transformation. You can see it all around
    us in nature, the leaves are changing colour, the air is cooler and
    days are shorter.

    You may feel like hiding away and hibernating during these colder
    months, however these are often the busiest and most stressful
    months of the year, (kids back at school, Christmas approaching),
    even more reason to stay energised, strong, balanced and relaxed!

    With this in mind, make your own transformation this autumn and
    start your own yoga practice. The 'Complete Beginners' or
    'Improving Beginners' courses are starting soon.

EVENT REMINDER: A BIGGER PICTURE AT HOUNSLOW - 17 OCTOBER 2014
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Over the next three years, London's Screen Archives is hitting the
    road for London: A Bigger Picture - a major project to introduce
    the capital to its cinematic heritage, and collect your home
    movies. First stop? Hounslow.

    Come to your local theatre to see treats from Hounslow Local
    Studies and Archive introduced by London's Screen Archives
    archivist Louise Pankhurst. She is joined by Local Studies
    Librarian James Marshall who will explain how the films fit
    into Hounslow's history and reveal more about the rich shared
    past they represent.

COUNCIL AND LOCAL COUNCILLORS SPEAK OUT AGAINST CHELSEA FC PROPOSAL
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    It seems that neither the Local Councillors or the Richmond Council
    seem to want Chelsea to use Twickenham Stadium while they redevelop
    Stamford Bridge. We at the St Margarets Community Website would
    have been willing to listen to the proposal before rejecting it out
    of hand; however, it doesn't look likely to even be entertained.
