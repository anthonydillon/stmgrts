ï»¿THE YEAR OF THE HORSE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Jan 31, 2014 - Feb 18, 2015

    Welcome to the Year of the Horse. Last year it was the Year of the
    Snake and next year it will be the Year of the Sheep....but this
    year it is the Year of the Horse - and so the horoscope of the East
    rolls around its mysterious annual cycle.

    Unlike the Western astrological system which divides the year
    into 12 monthly sections, each one named after a star
    constellation, the Eastern system is based on a cycle of 12 years,
    each with its own animal symbol.

THINGS TO DO... IN FEBRUARY HALF-TERM FROM FOR SANITY'S SAKE
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Have you got activities planned for the children in half term, or
    still looking for some inspiration? We've looked around the local
    area and further afield to bring you a few ideas...

    1. Feast on Chocolate

    Chocoholics will love the Chocolate Kitchen at Hampton Court, the
    only surviving royal chocolate kitchen in the country, where you
    can take part in live chocolate demonstrations in the actual spaces
    where drinking chocolate was prepared for George I and II. Or join
    the Chocolate Tour of London, tasting seven different chocolates
    around Mayfair - including a visit to Fortnum and Mason's. This
    runs until the end of the year.

RICHMOND COUNCIL FLOODING UPDATE - 14 FEBRUARY 2014
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Due to unusually high water levels in the Thames, Trowlock Island,
    Teddington, Hampton, and Hampton Wick have been placed on flood
    warnings or flood alerts by the Environment Agency.

    Other areas down stream of Teddington Lock (e.g. Twickenham /
    Richmond / Barnes etc) have not been declared at risk of flooding.

    Council officers have already been helping residents of Trowlock
    Island maintain links to the mainland. However, areas in the
    borough that are already prone to high tides are also likely to see
    a rise in the amount of water moving further in land than normal.

    The Council is working closely with key partners - including London
    Fire, local Police, the Environment Agency and local flood wardens
    - to monitor the situation and should the risk of flooding
    increase, additional emergency plans are in place to ensure the
    safety of vulnerable residents and the protection of vital
    local services.

WILD TOTS AND WILD PRE-SCHOOL - 2014 SPRING TERM
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    St Margarets Mum Ellie Wrigglesworth has always enjoyed mud and
    invites you and your children to come and share her passion!

    Wild Tots and Wild Pre-school are starting again after half term.
    Bring your children along for Gruffalo spotting, bear hunting,
    dragon chasing, dinosaur tracking, marshmallow toasting, den
    building, puddle jumping, mud making, singing and giggling!

    Ellie set up Wild Education when she trained as a Forest School
    practitioner and realized the importance of natural play
    and learning.

    Forest School is an ethos of education which has arrived
    from Scandinavia and is growing in popularity in UK nurseries and
    primary schools. It is focused on regular child led learning in a
    natural environment.

LETTERS - FLOOD INSURANCE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Trying to sort out renewal of my home insurance I've had a quote
    higher than ever before - just over 800 pounds for this year. 

    The insurer - Home Protect - says "your policy has been invited on
    a scheme which uses the latest flood mapping information and this
    has highlighted that your home may be at risk of flooding. As a
    result the excess for Flooding has been increased to 10,000 and
    Subsidence, Landslip and Heave to 5,000 pounds". 

    The mention of subsidence, landslip and heave refers to a claim
    made in 2004 relating to a drain crash.

    I would like to know if any of our neighbours have had their
    insurance premiums increased in light of the 'latest flood
    mapping information'

    Any one else having this issue with their insurance? Please leave a
    comment.
