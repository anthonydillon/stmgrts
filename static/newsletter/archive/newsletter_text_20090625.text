TAKE THE ST MARGARETS ALLIANCE SURVEY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    St Margarets Alliance Survey takes lead in Sustainable Community
    Act, seeking views for its Community Action Plan

    This week the St Margarets Alliance distributed a survey as the
    first stage towards a Community Action Plan.  The Survey asks
    residents to consider which aspects of their local environment,
    economy, or social well-being are most important to them and
    to prioritise the most important and urgent.

    St Margarets Alliance covers the voting ward of St Margarets and
    North Twickenham.  It is made up of representatives from the
    North St Margarets Residents' Association, Moormead Residents,
    Amyand Park Residents, St Margarets Traders and others.

    The group is so far best known as the organisation behind
    St Margarets' Crown Road summer and Christmas events -- including
    the recent Family Fun Day on Sunday 14th June.

    The group is non party-political and its purpose is to coordinate
    a Community Action Plan for the area. St Margarets Alliance does
    not have a specific agenda for the St Margarets area: the results
    of the Survey will form the basis for the basis of all future
    initiatives.  The group's guiding principle is
    'residents first'.

PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT TO THE REAR OF 37-55 ORCHARD ROAD
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    I would like to bring to your attention the proposed development
    that, if approved, would be build between the A316 and the homes
    on the south side of Orchard Road. It would consist of two (2)
    three-bedroom houses and two (2) one-bedroom flats. These houses
    and flats would result in more traffic, more demand for parking
    spaces, (to say nothing of the havoc caused during construction)
    and is just another attempt by a developer to over-develop our
    neighbourhood for their financial gain.

    In November of last year, when the Council asked the households
    which would be most immediately affected by this development
    to give their views on the proposal, 29 households lodged their
    objections - none supported it. The developer (with the guidance
    of the Planning Department) has since submitted numerous reports
    in an attempt to override the many objections cited by residents.
    Their last report, a parking survey, was sent to Planning
    on 10 June. I understand from Bryan Staff (in Planning) that
    his office will soon consider its decision. If you haven't done
    so already might I urge you to look at the developer's
    application and let Planning know your views.

    This development, if built, would place a further burden
    on already limited parking in the area, generate more traffic
    on our neighbourhood roads, would be unsafe as there is
    insufficient access for emergency vehicles, and would result
    in damage or loss of trees on the adjoining properties, among
    other objections. The construction period would cause increased
    traffic congestion and noise pollution.
