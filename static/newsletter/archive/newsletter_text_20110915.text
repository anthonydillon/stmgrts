LATEST NEWS
===========================================================



ï»¿TUESDAY.ELEVENTH.SEPTEMBER.TWO.THOUSAND.AND.ONE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    This is my memory of 9/11 and the reaction of the people I was
    with at the time.

    On Tuesday September 11th 2001 I was in the Balkans, sitting
    in front of an editing machine in the basement of a building
    in Skopje, Macedonia. We were cutting a children's TV drama series
    called "Nashe Maalo" about a multi ethnic group of young people -
    Albanian, Macedonian, Roma and Turkish - who solved their cultural
    differences through peaceful conflict resolution and understanding.
    The series was produced in response to the recent war in Kosovo, 7
    miles to the north. Fearing a repeat of similar inter-ethnic
    conflict in Macedonia "Nashe Maalo" had been commissioned by UNESCO
    to promote peace between the various cultural groups.

LOCAL WOMAN CLIMBING KILIMANJARO FOR HOPE FOR HEROES
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Phoebe Armstrong, a true St Margarets girl, who went to Orleans
    Infants, St Stephens and Orleans Park School is climbing Mount
    Kilimanjaro with two girlfriends on 20th October 2011 to help raise
    funds for the charity Help for Heroes and she needs our help. As
    their leaving date gets nearer, they need a final push to get
    to their target of 12k pounds. So far they have raised an impressive
    9k pounds by standing on the A316 with their Hope for Heros buckets
    on major rugby days and by having donation pots in the Turks
    Head Pub.

    So if you can, please help the 3 Blondes reach their goal.

OPEN HOUSE LONDON - 17 TO 18 SEPTEMBER 2011
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Open House London celebrates all that is best about the capital's
    buildings, places and neighbourhoods. Every September, it gives a
    unique opportunity to get out and under the skin of London's
    amazing architecture, with over 700 buildings of all kinds opening
    their doors to everyone - all for free. This year it takes place
    over the weekend of 17 and 18 September. Richmond has 23 unusual or
    historic buildings for the public to explore.

    With architects homes, eco and retrofit buildings, tours of major
    regeneration projects, landscape projects, government buildings,
    historic landmarks and towers, major infrastructure sites and more
    all available to explore over one weekend, it's a great way to find
    out how good design makes more liveable cities.

    Many properties require advanced booking, so go online now.

COUNCIL VOTES TO REPAY WRONGLY ISSUED PENALTY NOTICES
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Richmond Council will repay over #1 million in wrongly issued
    penalty charge notices, after Council Leader Lord True admitted
    tickets were issued 'when the authority should have known better'.
    The decision has been taken even though the Council is not legally
    compelled to do so.

    Between April 2009 - April 2011 around 18,500 tickets were paid
    after being issued by incorrectly certified Council-operated CCTV
    patrol cars to motorists who had committed apparent parking
    violations in the borough. A ruling that the Council was wrong was
    given by the independent Parking Tribunal Service (PATAS) after a
    motorist appealed his PCN.

TWICKERATI: SCHOOL DEBATE GETS EL BRUTE AIRING
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The big debate about a revolution in Borough schooling will not be
    televised. True, but you will be able to see it on a webcast via El
    Brute's site tonight. And it's not really a revolutionary debate
    either. More of an airing in the 'chamber of secrets' at York
    House. You're now thinking, "That made no sense whatsoever". You
    could well have a point. No, you DO have a point.

    So, to summarise where we are in the great Roman Catholic secondary
    school debate, coz that's what we're talking about...

    Vesely, from the Czech Republic, in the final - the first time a
    British player has lifted a boys' Grand Slam title since Andy
    Murray won at Flushing Meadows in 2004."

EVENT REMINDER: WINTER GARDENING FOR WILDLIFE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    2pm Sunday, 9 October at Kew Gardens

    October/November is the perfect time to prepare your garden so that
    you can help wildlife to get through the winter and thrive
    in spring.

    The loss of rural hedgerows and wetlands has made town gardens
    increasingly important to Britain's wildlife. Simple things can
    make all the difference between a healthy habitat and a lifeless
    no-go area.

    This afternoon of short talks and question sessions at Kew will
    offer practical advice about the things you can do now to help
    birds and other small creatures in your garden. There will also be
    the opportunity to take part in a new survey of local
    garden biodiversity.
