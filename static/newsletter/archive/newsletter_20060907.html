<p><em>7 September 2006</em></p>

<p>Welcome to the St Margarets Community Website Newsletter (<a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk">www.stmgrts.org.uk</a>).  Each Thursday we will send you the latest news and events from the website.</p>

<h2>Latest News</h2>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2006/09/event_reminder_9.html">Event Reminder: North St Margarets Annual Fun Day</a></h3>

<p>Residents of St. Margaret&#8217;s in Twickenham will be winding up the summer with a <a href="http://stmgrts.org.uk/event/Fair/200608310619">full day of fun for local people of all ages</a>, on Saturday September 9th.</p>

<p>Organised by the North St. Margaret&#8217;s Residents&#8217; Association, local children will begin the day by marking the bounds of the area in the ancient &#8220;Beating the Bounds&#8221; ceremony.  Drinks and prizes for the best fancy dress will be on offer, as well as willow wands to &#8220;mark&#8221; the boundary.</p>

<p>During the afternoon all the local streets will be transformed into an open market, as local residents hold pavement and front garden stalls in the Grand Annual Street Sale. Only a short hop from the riverside and Richmond Lock footbridge, and with bargains ranging from home-made produce to toys, books and bric a brac, visitors are encouraged to come along and buy a bargain (bus <span class="caps">H37</span>).</p>

<p>There will be a children&#8217;s &#8220;scratch band&#8221; performing in All Souls Church garden at 3.00 when all children up to 15 years old who can bang a drum, blow a whistle, or strum a guitar will play some impromptu music.  The day will be wound up with a residents&#8217; barbecue on the banks of the River Crane.</p>

<p>Laurence Mann, Secretary of the North St. Margaret&#8217;s Residents&#8217; Association said, &#8220;Now in its 4th year, the Neighbourhood Fun Day looks like being the best ever! It&#8217;s an easy way to meet up with neighbours and get to know each other, and above all to have fun!&#8221;</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2006/09/easy_way_to_hel.html">Easy Way to Help Local Schools</a></h3>

<p>Both <a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/directory/school/200506280125">Orleans Infants</a> and <a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/directory/school/200507170243">St Stephens</a> now have webshops where parents can buy online and give money to the schools at the same time.</p>

<p>It is a simple and really effective way of helping the schools which will cost the users nothing at all in terms of time or money.  When you use the above links, the retailers give money directly to the schools.</p>

<p>You can shop online at over 100 retailers including John Lewis, Early Learning Centre, Mothercare, Canvas Holidays, Amazon, <span class="caps">DVD.</span>co.uk, <span class="caps">BT,</span> Capital One&#8230; the list goes on and on.  Many of the retailers have exclusive online discounts and offers, often making it far cheaper than buying the same items on the high street.</p>

<p>When you log on through the links below and use the retailer&Atilde;&cent;&Acirc;&#128;&Acirc;&#153;s online shops, the schools will receive a set donation or a percentage of your purchases from the retailer.  It is out of their profit margin.  Some services such as signing up for BT Broadband can earn the school a donation of &#163;30 or &#163;10 when you book travel holiday insurance via Direct Line.</p>
