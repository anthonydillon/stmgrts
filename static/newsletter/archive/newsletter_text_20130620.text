LATEST NEWS
===========================================================



ï»¿TWO-PINT TOOMBS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Frank Toombs was an unlikely Battle of Britain hero. He wasn't your
    stereotypical young and dashing Spitfire pilot holding the
    Luftwaffe at bay in 1940. In fact he wasn't a pilot at all and
    at the age of 29 he was ancient when compared with his colleagues
    whose average age was 20. He was modest and married and his
    inability to drink more than two pints of the weak wartime beer
    before falling off his chair earned him the affectionate scorn
    of his friends and the nickname 'Two-pint.'

RICHMOND COMMUNITY AWARDS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    People in the borough who work tirelessly to help improve the
    quality of lives for others can now be rewarded via the Council's
    new mini 'honours' scheme, the Richmond Community Awards.

    The new community recognition scheme aims to recognise individuals
    who have:

     - Brought credit to the borough at a national level through,
        business, academic, sporting, artistic or cultural achievements.
     - Given outstanding service to the community over a number of years
        or in connection with an exceptional event or emergency.
     - Improved the quality of life for local people by providing services
       beyond what they are paid to do.
     - Benefited the community through community involvement or
       volunteering activity.

    The scheme could see local 'honours' granted to deserving and
    high-achieving people from every section of the community,
    from school crossing patrols and charity workers to leaders of
    their industry.

    Find out more and nominate your community hero by 11 July

VILLAGE NEWSLETTERS LAUNCHED - JUNE 2013
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Last Week Richmond Council launched its new Village e-Newsletters -
    localised email updates that are sent to over 25,000 residents.

    As well as council updates, they also showcase the work being
    carried out by local community groups or individuals and let people
    know how they can get involved.

    The next edition will go out before the end of July and the Council
    are now looking for story ideas. This is a great opportunity
    for local charities, community groups and social enterprises
    to include your events, activities, general promotion,
    announcements, launches, opportunities or general news. If you have
    any story ideas for the next edition, which can be for a specific
    area or for the whole borough, you can submit your story online.
    The deadline for stories is the 5th July 2013.
