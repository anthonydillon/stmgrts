MEETING NOTES : ST MARGARETS COMMUNITY PLAN
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    About sixty people attended the meeting at Winchester Hall, to 
    discuss the possibility of a local community plan for St Margarets. 
    It is anticipated that the community plan will be a based on 
    community values and provide the borough bureaucracies, local 
    councillors, other groups and residents with the guidelines to 
    maintain and improve the quality of life in St Margarets. Also 
    attending the meeting were the three new local councillors, elected
    on 4th May, four community police officers, and a representative

THIRD REPORT OF A FALSE FRONT AT THE TESCO CASH POINT
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Just 11 days after the last reported false front, we have received
    this report from PC Alan Richens.
    
      "There was another false front on cash machine outside 
       Tesco's yesterday (31 May 2006) morning, on this 
       occasion it was Tesco's staff who alerted police. 
       It has now been retained by police and will be 
       submitted for forensication.
       
       Tesco fraud department and the Royal Bank of Scotland
       have been contacted, they are introducing anti-skimming
       devices on ATM's. Due to the St Margarets' machine 
       being repeatedly targeted, they will prioritise 
       a device for this machine."
