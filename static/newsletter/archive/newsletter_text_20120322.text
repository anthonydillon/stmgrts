ï»¿DIG THIS!
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    "The standard allotment plot in England and Wales is the '10 pole
     plot', which if properly husbanded, should feed a family of four
     for a twelvemonth."

     -- National Society of Allotment and Leisure Gardeners Website

    When I first took up my allotment on Cole Park 20 years ago it was
    like the steppes with small groups of plot holders scattered
    across a vast undeveloped plain that hadn't seen spade or billhook
    since the days of "Dig for Victory". The only sound was the gentle
    swish of scythe and click-clack of clippers. The only concession
    to modernity was the plastic sacks full of horse manure. This was
    an ageing community, with some members who claimed they had learned
    to dig on D.Day. My own neighbour warned me never to walk on
    freshly tilled ground, not because of the seeds that might be
    growing there, but because of possible land mines!

UPDATE: SAVE TWICKENHAM FILM STUDIOS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Just to update you, Dr Cable has come out in support and we're
    meeting him on Monday. He is raising the issue with Jeremy Hunt.

    It would also help if residents could write the Council through our
    three local ward Councillors, who support the residents in this
    matter: Cllrs Acton, Khosa and Harrison

    We have received a letter from the council to the studios
    accountants which shows the owners chose to disregard
    council policy...

    The administrator, Mr Gerald Krasner, immediately upon his
    appointment, released a statement saying "It will not be retained
    as a studio, because there is no way of making it pay as a film
    studio." And Taylor Wimpey were immediately introduced as the
    studio owners preferred buyer. This is failing to follow protocol
    as there was no public consultation.

ST STEPHENS NUT STRIKE INFORMATION - 28 MARCH 2012
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    As you will be aware from the media, colleagues in NUT will be
    taking industrial action on the 28th March 2012. The action (a one
    day strike) will result in class or whole school closures across
    the country.

    The decision to close the school or send pupils home is never taken
    lightly, but in this instance, where staff elect to take lawful
    industrial action, I have no choice but to take appropriate steps
    to ensure the health, safety and well- being of all pupils.

    We are aware that school closures inconvenience parents and carers
    and so I am writing to give you advance notice of the likely impact
    of the action on this school. Our teaching staff belong to
    different unions and as it is only the NUT striking this time, we
    will be opening the following classes:

    6T, 6F and 3D

    All the other classes will be closed.

    Thank you for your patience and understanding. We apologise
    in advance for the inconvenience this will cause.
