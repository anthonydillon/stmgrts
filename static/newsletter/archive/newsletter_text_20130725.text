I DON'T SOUND LIKE NOBODY!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Almost exactly 60 years ago... on Saturday 18th July 1953, a
    teenage boy walked into the offices of Sun Records, on 706 Union
    Street, Memphis, Tennessee. He had been past the door many times
    before but this was the first time that he had actually entered.

    In later years the woman on reception, Marion Keisker, would still
    remember him, his long greasy hair, his shyness, the beat-up guitar
    that he was holding and what she described as a desperate look
    of need in his eyes. He asked how much it would cost to make a
    record. She told him. $3.98 plus tax for a two-sided acetate. An
    extra dollar got you a tape copy as well.

UPDATE FROM DREAMCATCHER FILM CAMPS - 25 JULY 2013
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Film Camps get off to a flying start as local company spreads
    its wings

    Dreamcatcher Media Ltd, started by local film and TV professionals
    Breda Fahey and David O'Keeffe, got their annual Summer Film Camps
    off to a flying start this week with the first group of wannabee
    young Spielbergs coming up with a psychological thriller plot they
    scripted themselves. They then got down to shooting their own movie
    under the guidance of experienced filmmakers.
