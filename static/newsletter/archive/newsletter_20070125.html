<p><em>25 January 2007</em></p>

<p>Welcome to the St Margarets Community Website Newsletter (<a href="https://stmargarets.london">stmargarets.london</a>).  Each Thursday we will send you the latest news and events from the website.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2007/01/boogie_before_b.html">Boogie Before Bedtime &#8230; with the Police!</a></h3>

<p><img src="https://stmargarets.london/assets/images/2007/Bhangra_BenJasKhosa_DelRhan-thumb.jpg" width="150" height="75" alt="Dancing at the PLG Party" align="right" style="padding: 1px; border: 1px solid #ccc;"/></p>

<p>If you missed the Boogie Before Bedtime last Friday night at Winchester Hall next door to The Turk&#8217;s Head, then you missed a treat. Hopefully, this will be a regular event, because let&#8217;s face it, how often does anyone get the chance to get down and boogie, anyway? And for free?</p>

<p>Hosted by the Police Liaison Group, and supported by the generosity of Twickenham Police and the Rugby Football Union, the great and the good of St Margarets &amp; North Twickenham Ward cast off all restraint and rocked to the best of DJ Martin Peters&#8217; tunes. You&#8217;d have to go a long way to find that kind of footwork and energy - and that&#8217;s just the police we&#8217;re talking about&#8230;</p>

<p>The other highlight of the evening - one that will be discussed at supper tables all over the Ward for weeks to come - was the high-octane display of Bhangra dancing put on by several pillars of the community, plus the constabulary and the Council.</p>

<p>Eat your hearts out, Bollywood - you&#8217;ve nothing to compare!</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2007/01/recycling_remin.html">Recycling Reminder</a></h3>

<p></p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Just to remind local residents that not only can you recycle your cans bottles paper etc. at both sites &#8212; near St Margarets Station and in East Twickenham but there now banks in these places for your cardboard.  If you want to be even greener you can recycle your plastic (not just plastic bottles but bags, toothpaste tubes, supermarket food wrapping, crisp packets, cellophane in fact every conceivable type of plastic) at the big Tesco in Isleworth, courtesy of Hounslow borough council! Our borough seems a bit slow in getting plastic recycling going so until they do this is an alternative but only when you have to shop there &#8212; not a special journey to do it!    And dont forget to use your green food waste bin, a vital part of keeping our landfill to a minimum. If we dont its a certainty that taxes will rise to pay for our unwillingness to embrace such measures.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

 <h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2007/01/planning_permis.html">Planning Permission Sought for Hand Car Wash on A316</a></h3>

 <p>The following has been highlighted by a local resident.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Can I draw residents attention to a planning application which has been submitted to open a hand car wash on the Chertsey Road (A316) at the end of the parking area for the offices.  Details are on the link below - not sure if residents on the opposite of the Chertsey Road have been informed but it involves building an office and the erection of   large Perspex shelter - not very pleasant to look at.  Residents have contacted ward councillors - Cllr Philip Morgan has responded to state that he will support resident&#8217;s objections.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
