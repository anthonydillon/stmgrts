MOORMEAD PLAYGROUND REFURBISHMENT UNDERWAY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    For those of you who have not been in Moormead Park lately, work 
    has begun on the refurbishment of the playground.  Starting about

    Currently only the brick outlines of the new toddler and
    children's areas are visible.  However, the Council still hopes 
    to have all work completed by the St Margarets' Fair on 15 July.
