<h3>Letters to America : The World of Daniel</h3>

<p>As English life continues for us, we have settled into some routines.  One of them seems to be fun play dates for Daniel several times a week right after school.  Daniel is Mr. Popular at school.  He landed in a very tight knit classroom where many of the children have been together in school since Nursery or Reception (English equivalent of American Kindergarten).  Rather than excluding him, however, many of the kids find him very interesting and all of the Mom&#8217;s have gone out of their way to make both me and Daniel feel welcome.  Last week, he had 3 after school play dates where the other child&#8217;s mother picked him up after school and I retrieved him from their house around 6 pm after he has been fed a &#8220;proper tea&#8221;.  One Mom who I have become friendly with gave me the scoop early on so that this would not seem strange to me.  It is standard procedure that if you have a young child over after school, you feed him/her supper.  I still have not quite figured out the difference between afternoon tea and a &#8220;proper tea&#8221;.  It is wreaking havoc with our dinner hour, but Daniel loves all the play time and has built himself a very nice network of friends. </p>
