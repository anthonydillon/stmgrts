STILL NO DATE FOR WINE BAR'S PLANNING HEARING
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    While the principles of the wine bar were hoping for an October 
    2005 hearing with the Richmond Council's Planning Committee, the

CHANCELLOR BROWN WANTS THIRD HEATHROW RUNWAY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Instead of only pushing to expand Stansted, it has emerged that 
    the government is planning to launch a new study into "identifying
    solutions that would allow" a third runway to be built at Heathrow
    Airport. The information was revealed in Chancellor Gordon Brown's
    most recent pre-Budget Report and confirmed by aviation minister
    Karen Buck. Already local action groups like HACAN and the
    Richmond Council are speaking out against it.
