HELP ORLEANS HOUSE GALLERY WIN THE ART FUND PRIZE 2009
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Orleans House Gallery has been long-listed for a 100,000 pound
    prize in the Art Fund prize draw. Ten museums and galleries across
    the country are competing for the grant which is awarded to the
    project who demonstrates the most originality, imagination
    and excellence.

    The Art Fund Prize recognises and stimulates originality and
    excellence in museums and galleries and aims to increase public
    appreciation and enjoyment of all they have to offer. Judges have
    already visited Orleans House and are now asking for the views
    of the public -- last year's winner The Lightbox Gallery in Woking
    had over 800 comments so we really need your help.

    Please register your support for Orleans House:

 THE WELSH WOMEN OF ST MARGARETS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    There's an old fruit tree 
    at the bottom of my garden 
    with a tale to tell...
    
    
    Once upon a time St Margarets didn't exist. Where we live now was 
    an empty space. No station, no pub, no shops, no houses, no post 
    office, no nothing. All that separated Isleworth, Twickenham, 
    Richmond and Hounslow were cornfields, orchards and market gardens 
    as far as the eye could see. Henry 8th called the area "London's
    breadbasket" and he was right. From the banks of the Thames and 
    up the gentle rise to Hounslow the business around here was food.
    
    Like today's modern growers the farmers and horticulturists 
    of the past relied upon seasonal labour from outside the area 
    to gather in the harvest and transport it to market. In the 18th
    and 19th century this labour was largely women from Dyfed and 
    Cardiganshire in Wales and Shropshire, Worcestershire and 
    Staffordshire in the Midlands. Every summer they would walk the
    200 miles or so along the old drovers roads to work in the fields 
    where St Margarets now stands. As they walked these' Welsh Women'
    as they were known would knit woollen stockings which they sold 
    to pay for their lodgings once they arrived.

EVENT REMINDER: ROCKIN' THE ISLAND!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    "Have you heard the news? 
     There's good rocking tonight!"
     
    
    Since the old Eel Pie Hotel in Twickenham and its famous jazz and 
    blues club burnt down in 1971 things have been pretty quiet 
    on Eel Pie Island. Water gently laps, birds sweetly coo and boats
    bob soothingly on their moorings. All is peace and calm. Well, 
    at least until now!
    
    On Saturday 25th April, drape suited, crepe booted rock 'n' roll
    returns to Eel Pie Island with an Easter Bunny Hop at Richmond 
    Yacht Club. As well as gen-u-ine 50's and 60's rock and pop music
    from everyone's local favourites 'Nark Drool and the Shudders' 
    there will be a licensed bar, hot food and a free dance lesson! 
    Jumping Jivers, Batman!
    
    If your creepers need dusting this is your chance to give them a
    work-out - and enjoy some of that authentic Eel Pie Island
    atmosphere at the same time.
    
    The Bunny Hop starts at 7.30 sharp and tickets are just 10 poinds 
    each. Please note that because of restricted numbers admission is
    by ticket only.
    
    Tickets can be booked now by contacting vocals@vodafone.net. 
    For further information please contact Billy Sincere 
    on 020 8892 5211.

CPZ: WHY SHOULD WE SUFFER THIS WHEN OUR ROAD COULD BE MUCH CLEARER?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Take a look at two streets at 9am any weekday morning. Godstone 
    Road will be full of parked commuter traffic, while Winchester
    Road will be almost empty.  This is how effective restricted 
    parking is at pushing more cars onto de-restricted roads like
    Godstone.  The only way to ensure this does not get even worse 
    is to ensure Godstone Road is included in the CPZ.
    
    I have just moved into this lovely area with my young son; getting
    him to and from my car and home several times a day is a real 
    problem for me. I'm sure most of the residents of Godstone Road 
    have their own troubles coping with this unwanted traffic hassle
    and we can put a stop to it simply be responding to the 
    Council's enquiry.
    
    Please take some time to complete the request to bring organisation
    to our road and ensure we have a quieter and more hassle free life.
    
    -- from Lucy  on Godstone Road
