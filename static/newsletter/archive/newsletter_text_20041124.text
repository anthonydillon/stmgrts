LETTERS TO AMERICA : THE WORLD OF DANIEL
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    As English life continues for us, we have settled into some 
    routines.  One of them seems to be fun play dates for Daniel 
    several times a week right after school.  Daniel is Mr. Popular 
    at school.  He landed in a very tight knit classroom where many 
    of the children have been together in school since Nursery or 
    Reception (English equivalent of American Kindergarten).  Rather 
    than excluding him, however, many of the kids find him very 
    interesting and all of the Mom's have gone out of their way to 
    make both me and Daniel feel welcome.  Last week, he had 3 after 
    school play dates where the other child's mother picked him up 
    after school and I retrieved him from their house around 6 pm 
    after he has been fed a "proper tea".  One Mom who I have become 
    friendly with gave me the scoop early on so that this would not 
    seem strange to me.  It is standard procedure that if you have
    a young child over after school, you feed him/her supper.  I 
    still have not quite figured out the difference between afternoon 
    tea and a "proper tea".  It is wreaking havoc with our dinner 
    hour, but Daniel loves all the play time and has built himself 
    a very nice network of friends.

MP VINCENT CABLE CLARIFIES POSITION ON WINE BAR
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Aware that his position had changed somewhat over the recent 
    weeks, the _St Margarets Community Website_ has asked out local 
    MP, Dr. Vincent Cable to clarify his current position on the wine
    bar and explain his reasoning.  

    He stated that,  "I wrote to the council in support of the 
    objectors and I have not changed my position."
