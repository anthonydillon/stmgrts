THE QUEEN OF SCREAMS LIVED HERE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    A few weeks ago I wrote about Halloween and how the streets 
    of St Margarets were crowded with young ghouls, ghosties and 
    goblins. Today I report that the Mistress of them all -- the
    Queen of Screams and the Empress of the Undead is no longer 
    with us.
    
    Ingrid Pitt died last week just two days after her 73rd birthday. 
    This well regarded actor, writer, former resident of St Margarets
    and star of such classic Hammer horror films as "The Vampire
    Lovers" and "Countess Dracula" was admired around the world. 
    Her legions of fans included gentlemen of a certain age much 
    taken by her stunning looks, her voluptuous figure and her 
    frequent appearances as a "lusty, busty, predatory bloodsucker" 
    and you don't get many of those walking down Crown Road 
    these days.
    
    "I was born into the biggest horror show of the century -- the 
     brutality of the Nazi regime. I think that it is amazing that 
     I do horror films when I had this awful childhood. But maybe 
     that's why I'm good at it!"

EVENT REMINDER: PICTURING SCIENCE EXHIBITION
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    From 4 December 2010 - 26 February 2011.
    
    Disease, dissection, and Darwin become the subject for artists 
    displaying at the Riverside Gallery, Richmond from 4th December
    2010. Orleans House Gallery presents Picturing Science, an open 
    exhibition which examines the collision between two harmonious
    and contrasting fields of symbolic representation, Art 
    and Science.
    
    Picturing Science continues the successful programme of open
    exhibitions from Orleans House Gallery, Twickenham. After 
    receiving 650 works from over 130 artists and an intense 
    selection process, the judging panel whittled the submissions 
    down to just 26 works in various media. The criteria included 
    a direct yet imaginative concept and technical virtuosity.
