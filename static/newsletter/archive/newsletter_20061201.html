<p><em>30 November 2006</em></p>

<p>Welcome to the St Margarets Community Website Newsletter (<a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk">www.stmgrts.org.uk</a>).  Each Thursday we will send you the latest news and events from the website.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2006/11/beware_bogus_ch.html">Beware Bogus &#39;Charities&#39; and Third World Appeals</a></h3>

<p>Residents regularly receive leaflets asking for items of clothing and household goods to be left for collection.</p>

<p>It is estimated by the <em>Association of Charity Shops</em> that the potential value of donated clothing and other items &#8216;lost&#8217; to legitimate charities as a result of these bogus &#8216;charities&#8217; collections amounts to over &#163;1 million per annum. Many genuine charities rely on such doorstep collections for a substantial proportion of their shop sales.</p>

<p><strong>Not All Alleged Charities are Registered</strong></p>

<p>If unsure the number on the leaflet can be checked with <em>The Central Register of Charities</em> on 0845 3000 218 or online at <a href="http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/">www.charity-commission.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2006/11/play_reminder_h.html">Play Reminder: Humpty Dumpty</a></h3>

<p><img src="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/humptyD-thumb.jpg" width="118" height="166" alt="Humpty D" align="right" /></p>

<p><strong><span class="caps">THE EGG MAN COMETH</span></strong></p>

<p>It&#8217;s panto time again (oh yes, it is!), and audiences young and old will flock for an evening of Christmas magic and mirth as some of theatre&#8217;s best-loved characters don their makeup and tread the boards.</p>

<p>Among perennial favourites in the panto calendar is original egg-man Humpty Dumpty, and this year there&#8217;s no need to shell out a fortune on train fares (oh no, there isn&#8217;t!) to witness the fun.</p>

<p>From 7th to 16th December the Richmond Shakespeare Society stages this evergreen Xmas classic right on the doorstep at the eggscellent Mary Wallace Theatre beside the Thames at Twickenham, and so the youngest fans don&#8217;t miss their bedtime, there&#8217;ll be two Saturday matinees, not one.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2006/11/event_reminder_19.html">Event Reminder: Music at Christmas</a></h3>

Well, despite being short a few tenors &#8212; <em>hint, hint</em> &#8212; the recently formed choir are ready for a <a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/event/Concert/200611300948">Christmas concert</a> at Richmond College.</p>

<p>The concert features choral, chamber music and jazz, performed by the Music Students, Community Choir and Jazz Band of Richmond upon Thames College.  Works to be performed are by Monteverdi, Pachelbel and Mozart.  Also choruses and solos from Handel&#8217;s Messiah and a Jazz Programme.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2006/11/event_reminder_18.html">Event Reminder: Fighting Alcohol &amp; Drugs Seminar</a></h3>

<p>The fight against alcohol and drugs misuse will be highlighted at a <a href="http://stmgrts.org.uk/event/Meeting/200611290308">seminar in York House</a> on 12 December. </p>

<p>The event is being organised by the Richmond upon Thames Community Safety Partnership, a crime fighting alliance comprising Richmond Council, the police and numerous other agencies.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2006/11/no_christmas_fa.html">No Christmas Fair on Crown Road</a></h3>

<p>Sadly there will be no Christmas Fair in Crown Road this year.  The St Margarets Traders Association, who normally organises the event, has decided to take a year off from hosting the event.  The fair is an enormous amount of work for the Traders Association and requires coordination with the traders, local school <span class="caps">PTA</span>s, Richmond Council, Met Police, fun fair people, craft stalls, bands, street performers, street closure, insurance, lighting and clean-up to name a few.  Hopefully next year the tradition returns.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2006/11/cpz_consultatio.html"><span class="caps">CPZ</span> Consultation in St Margarets Delayed</a></h3>

<p>The consultation for the proposed Controlled Parking Zone [CPZ] in St Margaret&#8217;s village will not start until late January at the earliest. The Council&#8217;s Cabinet plans to decide at its meeting on Monday, 15 January 2007, on the details of its new charging scheme for <span class="caps">CPZ</span>s, which is currently out to consultation (see <a href="http://tinyurl.com/ydb8fg">Consultation on emission based charging for parking permits</a> and note the deadline for receipt of completed questionnaires and comments is 15 December 2006.)</p>

<p>If all runs to plan, the consultation will start as soon as is feasible after January 15 and will contain full details of the charges that will apply if a <span class="caps">CPZ </span>is created. A legal challenge to the new scheme (unlikely but possible) will delay matters further.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2006/11/art_deco_london.html">Art Deco London - Local Book, Local Bargain</a></h3>

<p><img src="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/assets/images/2006/art_deco_london-thumb.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="book cover" style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 1px;" align="right" /></a></p>

<p>Art Deco London  written by local resident Colin Hines with photographs by Paul Riddle and Keith Cheetham is the first ever guide book to the 20&#8217;s and 30&#8217;s deco delights of the capital. Its 60 pages contain 110 superb colour photographs and shows where in London magnificent examples of art deco can be found, eaten and quaffed in, slept in, shopped in, and campaigned for. Its deco delights range from &#8216;palaces of the people&#8217; cinemas (many saved thanks to bingo), theatres, hotels, homes, shops, museums, a deco hospital and even a &#8216;decover and out&#8217; crematorium.</p>

<p>Local deco delights include Twickenham Bridge, Mortlake Crematorium and the authors own &#8216;Miami in Middlesex&#8217; 30&#8217;s home.</p>

<p>The book would make an excellent Christmas present for anyone interested in architechture &#8212; think mini-coffee table book.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2006/11/event_reminder_17.html">Event Reminder: Christmas Shooting Star Night</a></h3>

<p><img src="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/images/events/Skaband_thumb.jpg" width="150" height="98" alt="Ska Band" style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding:1px;" align="right" /></a></p>

<p>December will be ushered in with a special <a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/event/Show/200611021616">Shooting Start Winter Party</a> at the Turks Head on Friday 1st December in aid of The Shooting Star Children&#8217;s Hospice. This will definitely put everyone in the mood for a festive Christmas period before getting bogged down with all that Christmas shopping.</p>

<p>With four terrific local Twickenham bands playing a wide range of music, from Motown to Glamrock, it promises to be a fun-filled evening. The headline act is  &#8220;The Shooting Ska Allstars&#8221; playing their highly infectious blend of Reggae and Ska music.  &#8220;The Funk Bomb Detonators&#8221; kick off the evening with 60&#8217;s Soul and Motown numbers and St Margarets&#8217; very own &#8220;Doghouse&#8221;  will be playing a great selection of hits from across the years. Glitter and platform heels will be the order of the day as  Glamrock band &#8220;Bulge&#8221; go on stage, celebrating 10 years since they debuted live for the first time, at the Turk&#8217;s Head.</p>

<p>Tickets are &#163;5 on the door and the music starts at 8.00 pm</p>
