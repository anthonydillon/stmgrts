LATEST NEWS

ï»¿THE RETURN OF THE ROBOTS AND THE GOLEM OF PRAGUE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Before we get too excited about the future and 'squadrons
    of automatons zipping about' we should not forget that the concept
    of robots, replicants and androids has been around for centuries.
    One of the great Cretan myths about Talos, the mechanical man who
    guarded the island from pirates, dates back to 400 years BC. An
    automaton with a similar defensive purpose was created
    in Czechoslovakia in the sixteenth century.

ST MARGARETS TRADERS ASSOCIATION'S ADAM TOCOCK STEPS DOWN
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    After many years of service, Adam Tocock is stepping down from his
    role with the St Margarets Traders Association. Adam helped
    organise the group and all their activities, including publishing
    the wonderful St Margarets magazines and running the semi-annual
    Crown Road fairs. It is hard and often unappreciated work, but Adam
    pushed forward with a smile on his face and a ready joke. Thank you
    Adam and we will see you at Cutters.

FREE CHILD CARE PROVISION PETITION
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Conservatives made a promise of 30 hours "free" child care
    during the last general election. There are currently insufficient
    state nursery places locally (only one in four of those in the
    Borough are in state nurseries with the rest being provided by the
    voluntary sector or private sector).

MOORMEAD FC BIDS TO SAVE THE MOORMEAD PARK PAVILLION
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    On Saturday 16 January 2016, hundreds of St Margarets residents
    braved freezing temperatures to show their support for the
    renovation of Moormead Park Pavilion.

    Parents from Moormead Football Club are waiting to hear back
    from Richmond Council about their community-led 'expression
    of interest' to restore the Pavilion building, which was submitted
    in December last year.
