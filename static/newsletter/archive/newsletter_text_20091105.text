SHERIDAN IN ST MARGARETS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    "Whatever Sheridan has done or chosen to do has been par
     excellence always the best of its kind"
     
     LORD BYRON
     
    In his time the politician and playwright Richard Brinsley 
    Sheridan (30th October 1751 - 7th July 1816) was thought to be 
    the wittiest man in England. Once, in February 1809, when he was
    discovered drinking a glass of wine in the street as he watched 
    his own Theatre Royal burn down, Sheridan famously retorted, "A 
    man may surely be allowed to take a glass of wine by his
    own fireside!"
    
    On another occasion he bumped into two royal dukes on Piccadilly.
    
    "I say Sherry," said one of them. "We just been discussing 
     whether you are more rogue than fool."
     
    "Why faith," replied Sheridan, taking each by the arm, 
    "I believe that I am between both!"
    
    Rib tickling stuff, I am sure that you will agree.
