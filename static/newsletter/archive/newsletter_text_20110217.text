LATEST NEWS
===========================================================



"YOU ARE KOLLEY KIBBER - YOU COME FROM STRAWBERRY HILL...
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    "... and I Claim The 'Community Newsletter' Prize!"

    Graham Greene's 1938 thriller "Brighton Rock" - recently been
    filmed for the second time - opens with the murder of a newspaper
    tout called Kolley Kibber.

    "Advertised on every 'Messenger' poster: 'Kolley Kibber in Brighton
    today'." In his pocket he had a packet of cards to distribute
    in hidden places along his route: those who found them would
    receive ten shillings from the 'Messenger', but the big prize was
    reserved for whoever challenged Hale in the proper form of words
    and with a copy of the 'Messenger' in his hand: 'You are Mr Kolley
    Kibber. I claim the 'Daily Messenger 'prize'.

    This was Hale's job, to do sentry go, until a challenger released
    him, in every seaside town in turn: yesterday Southend, today
    Brighton, tomorrow-"

    -- BRIGHTON ROCK Graham Greene

    Graham Greene based his "Kolley Kibber" upon a real life character
    called 'Lobby Lud' invented in August 1927 by the 'Westminster
    Gazette'. Noticing that people on holiday didn't buy newspapers the
    'Gazette' devised a clever merchandising scheme to persuade holiday
    makers to go out and buy theirs. A photograph of the mysterious
    'Lobby Lud', (a.k.a William Chinn) - complete with fedora and pipe,
    was printed in the paper with a schedule listing the popular
    seaside resorts and times when he might be seen. Any 'Gazette'
    reader with a copy of that day's paper who recognised him and
    challenged him with the precise words "You are Mr Lobby Lud - I
    claim the 'Westminster Gazette' prize", would win 50 quid which is
    worth about 1,670 pounds today.
