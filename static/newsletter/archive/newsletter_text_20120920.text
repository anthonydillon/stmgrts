﻿VERY WELL, ALONE!
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    How Britain trained to defend itself in Osterley Park

    On June 18th 1940 the Evening Standard published a cartoon by David
    Low. It showed a grim faced British soldier standing on a rock
    in the middle of a stormy sea shaking his fist at a squadron
    of enemy bombers approaching across a pitch black sky. The caption
    read "Very well. Alone."

    And so it was that late spring of 1940. Britain was alone. France
    had just fallen to the Nazis. The British Expeditionary Force was
    back home from Dunkirk, badly chewed and short of equipment.
    America, yet to join the war, was prevented from resupplying us
    because of the Neutrality Act. Faced with the prospect of imminent
    invasion and encouraged by a public anxious to "do its bit", on the
    14th May the Government formed the Local Defence Volunteers
    (L.D.V), shortly to become the Home Guard, as a second and final
    line against the Nazis.
