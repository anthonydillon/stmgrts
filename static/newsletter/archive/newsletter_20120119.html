<blockquote><p>&#39;Here let us trace the matchless vales of Thames,<br />
Far winding up top where the muses haunt,<br /><br /><br />
To Twitnam&#39;s bowers.&#39;</p></blockquote>

<p><cite>James Thomson</cite></p>

<p>In the 17<sup>th</sup> century the walk along the river from Old Isleworth to Twickenham was regarded as one of the most beautiful in Britain. Even as late as 1948 local historian <span class="caps">G.E</span> Bate was still generally complimentary. <em>&#39;Although much of it is still beautiful it has lost some of the freshness and rural aspect that it then bore.&#39;</em></p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2012/01/finally_richmond_council_consultation_on_clifden_r.html">Finally, Richmond Council Consultation on Clifden Road Site </a></h3>

<p>Council statement:</p>

<p>Use of the Clifden Road Site, Twickenham [Consultation of residents by the borough council]</p>

<p><em>January 17, 2012 6:38 PM</em></p>

<p><span class="caps">LAST </span>year, the Council agreed to buy the Clifden Road site of Richmond Adult Community College and is now considering whether to make the site available to establish:</p>

<ul>
<li>a five-form Voluntary Aided Catholic secondary school<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2012/01/finally_richmond_council_consultation_on_clifden_r.html#fn1">1</a></sup>; and</li>

<li>a one-form Voluntary Aided Catholic primary school with some community places.<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2012/01/finally_richmond_council_consultation_on_clifden_r.html#fn2">2</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<p>The Council is aware that many people in the borough hold strong views on the type of education, if any, that should be provided at Clifden Road. This consultation provides an opportunity for residents to have their say on the proposals for the site.</p>

<p>Your views are important to us and the information you provide will help the Council understand residents&#39; concerns and priorities prior to making its decision about how the site will be used. Please complete the survey by 5 pm on the 16<sup>th</sup> March 2012. You can complete the survey online or you can request a paper copy by contacting Matthew Paul by email <a href="mailto:m.paul@richmond.gov.uk">m.paul@richmond.gov.uk</a> or by phone 8891 7588.</p>

<p>Please read through the consultation documents and the glossary before completing the survey.</p>

<p>The future of youth provision in the Borough is bubbling up nicely as part of the <span class="caps">TWAP </span>(Twickenham Area Action Plan). You will recall that when the Plan got its first airing there was a lot of consternation from fans of Heatham House over the suggestion that it could be turned into posh flats or a boutique hotel. A petition did the rounds. The Council were suggesting that &#39;da kids&#39; could be provided with an alternative facility elsewhere, probably on the old sorting office site next door&#8230;</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2012/01/the_good_wine_shop_closes_st_margarets_shop.html">The Good Wine Shop Closes St Margarets Shop</a></h3>

<div class="letter">

<p><img src="/images/directory/200511281416_The_Good_Wine_Shop.jpg"  alt="The_Good_Wine_Shop" width="150"  align="right" style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 1px;" /></p>

<p>Sadly, due to circumstances beyond our control, <a href="http://www.thegoodwineshop.co.uk/">The Good Wine Shop</a> will be moving out of our St Margarets Shop on Monday 23 January.</p>

<p>It has been a pleasure to be part of this amazing community for the last 12 years and we would like to thank you all for your incredible support.</p>

<p>Our business is in good health and within the next year we plan to open two new shops and we are currently scouting for the best locations to do so.</p>

<p>We also have our lovely shop in Kew, which stocks all the St Margarets wines plus many many more. Our friendly staff will be more than happy to show you around.</p>

<p>If you have one of our blue bags, it will still work in Kew and as a thank you for your loyalty you will receive a free bottle of Prosecco the first time you fill the bag up in Kew!</p>

<p>Alternatively, we would love to continue serving you via our website, which provides free delivery on all orders to <span class="caps">TW1, TW7, TW9 </span>and <span class="caps">TW10 </span>post-codes. You can still enjoy your favourite wines and better still we&#39;ll deliver them directly to your door.</p>

<p><strong>Mark Wrigglesworth</strong><br />
Owner</p>

<p>We wish them the best of luck and hope they fine a nearby location soon.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2012/01/green_fingered_grant_for_local_charity.html">Green Fingered Grant for Local Charity</a></h3>

<p>Local charity Richmond <span class="caps">AID</span>&#39;s gardening project for disabled residents is set to receive &pound;5,000 as part of Richmond Council&#39;s Civic Pride Grant fund.</p>

<p>The volunteer-run Richmond <span class="caps">SPADE </span>provides a tailored gardening service for elderly or disabled residents in the borough. Local volunteers utilise their skills to tidy, prune and clean gardens so that they are safe, accessible and can be enjoyed by their owner. This funding will go towards the continued running costs of the programme and help with the purchasing and maintaining equipment and gardening tools.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2012/01/st_margarets_kumon_starts_fifth_year.html">St Margarets Kumon Starts Fifth Year</a></h3>

<p>St Margarets Kumon centre is now in its 5<sup>th</sup> year and we have helped numerous children from the community and local schools to do better at school. It may be Early Primary years, end of Primary school or transition to Secondary school. Many children at the St Margarets centre have been with us for 4 years now. It is important before starting Kumon to have a goal in mind so you know what you are aiming for. We have helped children prepare for tests in Independent schools, 11+ and Grammar schools because Kumon takes you ahead of school curriculum and assists in speed, concentration and accuracy.</p>

<p>Our assurance is that if your child does daily work for 10 to 15 minutes and stays with us for 2 years, they can be at the top of their class in 9 months to a year and in the 2<sup>nd</sup> year consolidate their learning and become independent learners.</p>
