EVENT REMINDER: NORTH ST MARGARETS ANNUAL FUN DAY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Residents of St. Margaret's in Twickenham will be winding up the 
    summer with a full day of fun for local people of all ages,
    on Saturday September 9th.
    
    Organised by the North St. Margarets Residents' Association,
    local children will begin the day by marking the bounds of the 
    area in the ancient "Beating the Bounds" ceremony.  Drinks and 
    prizes for the best fancy dress will be on offer, as well as 
    willow wands to "mark" the boundary.

    During the afternoon all the local streets will be transformed 
    into an open market, as local residents hold pavement and front
    garden stalls in the Grand Annual Street Sale. Only a short hop
    from the riverside and Richmond Lock footbridge, and with
    bargains ranging from home-made produce to toys, books and 
    bric a brac, visitors are encouraged to come along and buy a
    bargain (bus H37).

EASY WAY TO HELP LOCAL SCHOOLS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Both Orleans Infants and St Stephens now have webshops where 
    parents can buy online and give money to the schools at the 
    same time.

     It is a simple and really effective way of helping the schools 
     which will cost the users nothing at all in terms of time 
     or money.  When you use the above links, the retailers give
     money directly to the schools.

    You can shop online at over 100 retailers including John Lewis, 
    Early Learning Centre, Mothercare, Canvas Holidays, Amazon,
    DVD.co.uk, BT, Capital Oneâ€¦ the list goes on and on.  Many of 
    the retailers have exclusive online discounts and offers, often
    making it far cheaper than buying the same items on the 
    high street.
