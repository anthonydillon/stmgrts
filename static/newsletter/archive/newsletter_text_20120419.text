LATEST NEWS
===========================================================



ï»¿HAPPY BIRTHDAY, CHRIS!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    We all like to think that we are independent souls, free to make
    our own decisions and go our own way... but in reality we're not. Our
    lives are shaped and directed by outside influences - and these
    reveal themselves in everything we do - and say and think.

    Some influences are easy to pin down -. a teacher at school, the
    fashion designer, that man on the telly, this woman in the street ...
    but much of our inspiration comes from people unknown. On 17th
    April 2012 one of the most important but least recognised movers
    and shakers of our time celebrated his 82 birthday. His name is
    Donald Christopher 'Chris' Barber, he was born in Welwyn Garden
    city and without him British popular music and the scene that goes
    with it would not be as rich, as creative and as diverse as it
    is today.

VINEYARD SCHOOL ROCKS WITH RICK ASTLEY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Forget cake sales and tombola stalls, Richmond's Vineyard Primary
    School is taking fundraising to a whole new level by staging its
    very own music festival, 'The Vineyard Live' on Saturday 19 May.

    In the first event of its kind to be held at a school, Eighties pop
    legend and internet sensation Rick Astley will be headlining in the
    run up to performing at one of the year's biggest concerts 'The Hit
    Factory Live' in Hyde Park in July.

    Supporting Rick Astley and his band the Luddites will be the Barnes
    Blues Band, rockers Lady Bear and 'rock and roll's best kept
    secret', Never the Bride. As well as entertaining the crowd
    with some of the eighties biggest hits, Rick will be performing
    cover versions of hits by The Arctic Monkeys, The Kings of Leon and
    T Rex.

    The 'Vineyard Live' festival will see the school transformed into a
    mini Glastonbury with food stalls and bars, with organisers hoping
    the event will raise more than 20,000 pounds.

    More Information

     - Tickets for the event are available at www.seetickets.com for 25
        pounds with funds going to the Shooting Star Hospice and the
        Vineyard School.
