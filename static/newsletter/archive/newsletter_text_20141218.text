ï»¿THE OTHER CHRISTMAS TRUCE - 1915
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    After nearly a year of remembrance of the 1st World War most of us
    already know the story of the Christmas Truce of 1914, when
    British, French and German troops sang carols together across 'No
    Man's Land' and rose from their trenches to play football and
    exchange gifts. It has been written about and dramatised in plays
    and films, pop videos and songs. This year the truce even provided
    the theme for a Sainsbury's TV commercial.


    But there was another Christmas Truce that is less well known. It
    took place the following year in 1915 in the front line trenches
    at Laventie in Northern France and we know this because of two men
    who were there.

CHRISTMAS DAMAGE LIMITATION GUIDE
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    There are several reasons why most of us will gain weight
    through December and it's not just because we're surrounded by more
    fat- and sugar-laden food than usual.

    Motivation to exercise plummets, and whilst we may excuse ourselves
    because we're in 'holiday mode', this comes with a nagging sense
    of the impending struggle that awaits us in the New Year. Most of
    us will put on 7-10lb, our exercise routine will disintegrate and
    we'll resign ourselves to eating everything we set eyes on just
    'because it's Christmas'. January 1 rolls around and it can feel
    like a depressing uphill struggle just to get back on track again.

    The good news is that it doesn't have to be this way. There are
    some pretty simple steps you can take to stay on top of things
    without missing out on the fun.

    Here's how you can have your cake and eat it this Christmas.
