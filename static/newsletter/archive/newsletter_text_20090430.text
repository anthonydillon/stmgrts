LATEST NEWS
===========================================================



STEWART AND MARTHA
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    One of the more interesting and perhaps alarming aspects of local 
    history is just when you think the story is done and tucked away 
    into the archives it suddenly jumps out again and surprises you. 
    This is the case with Stewart Headlam whose anarchic story was 
    recorded in this newsletter two weeks ago.
    
    Readers of the article will remember that local minister Stewart
    Headlam (1847-1924) was a renegade Christian Socialist who 
    preached that the church's role was to help the poor and 
    oppressed. The Bishop of London eventually banned Headlam 
    from preaching when he claimed that Jesus Christ was 
    a revolutionary.
    
    During his life Headlam was a staunch defender of anyone who had
    offended the stuffy guardians of respectability. In 1885 when 
    Oscar Wilde was tried for 'gross indecency' Headlam supported
    him and put up half of his 5,000 pounds bail.

CHARITY FASHION SHOW RAISES OVER 3,000 POUNDS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    One of the recent highlights at Parvinu was a Lingerie and 
    Swimwear fashion show held in aid of Lynn's Bowel Cancer Campaign.
    
    The show was hosted by Susana Lorena who owns and runs SL Privee, 
    a lingerie shop on Richmond Hill. It was a packed house and we were
    delighted to support the event and play our part by assisting 
    with the setting, the music, light bites and crisp cold prosecco, 
    all of which helped the evening really go off with a bang.
    
    The most pleasing aspect of the evening was being able to work 
    successfully with local businesses and charities, fulfilling our
    desire to become a positive part of the local community.
    
    At the time of writing the charity had raised over 3,000 pounds 
    on the evening.

BUSINESS NETWORKING AT PARVINU
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    We are delighted to say that we have become a popular destination
    for Business Networking communities. We have hosted several 
    evenings that have proved very popular and attended 
    by representatives from companies small and large, all benefitting
    from the easy and informal atmosphere that Parvinu provides.
    
    The most successful event was held by The Best of Richmond 
    -- the largest and best-supported organisation supporting 
    businesses in the Borough of Richmond.
    
    We were pleased to support another St Margarets business on the 
    evening, The Yellow Wedge Cheese Shop They put on a great display
    of their delicious artisan cheeses for guests to sample and we 
    helped things along by providing a selection of wines to taste 
    which our wine expert chose to match the stunning fare offered 
    by the guys at Yellow Wedge.
    
    They are coming back soon to hold their own evening at Parvinu, 
    so we suggest you visit their Crown Road shop and find out more.
