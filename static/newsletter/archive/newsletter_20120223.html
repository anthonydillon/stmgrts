<blockquote><p>&#8220;It was very strange. Tommy Steele got voted &#8220;Top Guitarist of the Year&#8221; but we all knew that it was Bert Weedon who did the playing!&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><cite>An Anonymous Session Musician 1958</cite></p>

<p>In the mid 1950&#39;s a new type of singer appeared on the music scene - the teen idol. They were young, appealing and some of them were even able to hold a tune. With a little work and a change of name to something meaningful like Danny Trouble, Billy Sincere or Ricky Livid, they and their managers hoped to open a door to fame and fortune. The problem was for all their toothy smiles these performers weren&#39;t smart enough to turn the lacklustre songs of the time into hit records. The Dannys, Billys and Rickys needed a new type of musician to support them. They had to be young, talented, in step with rock &#39;n&#39; roll music and above all busting at the seams with new and exciting ideas. These were the players who would come up with the musical licks and hooks that would catch a listener&#39;s attention and hold it. These were the musicians who could turn garbage into gold and in the coffee bars and skiffle cellars of Soho they found them - the session men.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2012/02/review_of_dolce_divas_4_concert.html">Review of Dolce Divas 4 Concert</a></h3>

<p>An audience were treated to a wonderful concert on Saturday by the St Margarets based quartet The Dolce Divas 4 at All Saints Church, Isleworth. Consisting of two flutes, cello and piano they played a variety of different pieces ranging from Chopin to Edith Piaf. Many of the pieces were arranged for this rather unusual ensemble by cellist Noonie Minogue. Rosie Timpson, one of the flautists, also sang some of the numbers; the  wonderful Speak Low  by Kurt Weill with lyrics by Ogden Nash, Youkali also by Weill with words by Roger Fernay. Rosie has a clear, pure voice which is a pleasure to listen to. Angela Fogg&#39;s accomplished piano accompanied some unusual pieces from composers such as Quantz and Doppler. Lilly Dufter-Wimmer, flautist, provided us with some extraordinary and skillful virtuoso performances most notably a spellbinding Chopin variation on a theme by Rossini. Tony Crean read <em>Fern Hill</em> by Dylan Thomas and sang with Rosie the final number, <em>Fancy Forgetting</em> by Sandy Wilson.</p>

<p>Admission was free but there was a collection in aid of St Stephens&#39;s school. The heartfelt and enthusiastic applause confirmed that further concerts will be eagerly anticipated.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2012/02/river_crane_pollution_october_2011_was_it_the_only.html">River Crane Pollution October 2011 - was it the only time?</a></h3>

<p>In late October 2011, when the major pollution occurred in the Crane, I <a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2011/10/river_crane_polluted.html">posted the following to the St Margarets site</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p> &#8220;Just in case my comment didn&#39;t get through to this subject - we alerted <span class="caps">NRA </span>on 9<sup>th</sup> Oct that the river was deep black &amp; stank. We saw a crab trying to climb out near the Hill View Rd bridge. <span class="caps">NRA </span>phoned next day for details. Are they saying that there were 2 leaks?&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Someone called Ed posted a note telling me very firmly that it was a separate incident. I remained, and remain, unconvinced and sent a letter to the <span class="caps">R&amp;TT </span>which published it. Dr Cable sent a copy to the Environment Agency who replied to him with, amongst others, the following statements:-</p>

<ul>
<li>&#8220;&#8230; his(i.e. my) partner reported that the fish&#8230; were not in distress&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;We did not attend the incident on this occasion as the information provided by Mr Alexander and his partner suggested that the problem was not severe &#8220;</li>
<li>&#8220;We have access to the monitoring system run by The British Airport Authority (which) records the water quality of the River Crane. We checked the data &#8230; for.. 7 to 9 October (and) there was no indication (of) pollution in that location&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;The data does not appear to indicate a link between the problems 7 and 9 October with the major incident on the 29 October 2011&#8221;</li>
</ul>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2012/02/twickenham_film_studios_put_up_for_sale.html">Twickenham Film Studios put up for sale</a></h3>

<p>Twickenham Film Studios is being sold one year before its centenary.</p>

<p>A current freelance worker at the studios, where films including Alfie and the Italian Job were produced, said staff had to leave the premises by July.</p>

<p>Future projects already booked there will be moved to other venues, such as Pinewood Studios.</p>

<p>The source, who asked to remain anonymous, said selling the studios to property developers was the &#8220;easiest option&#8221; for the current owners.</p>
