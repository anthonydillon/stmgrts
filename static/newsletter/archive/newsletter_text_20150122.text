LATEST NEWS
===========================================================



ï»¿THE JANUARY PARLIAMENT
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Exactly 750 years ago to this week, on the 20th January 1265,
    elected representatives from all over the country gathered together
    for the first time to speak on behalf of their communities and some
    of the people living within them. It was an early demonstration
    of how democracy can rise over the absolute power of the monarchy
    and it laid the foundations of what is now called Parliament. One
    of the leaders of this popular movement was Simon de Montfort who
    took the first faltering steps towards freedom in a field by the
    Thames in a place now known as St Margarets. His story appeared
    in these pages in August 2012...

TRAINING FOR THE LONDON MARATHON? A FEW IDEAS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Firstly congratulations on making the commitment. Most training
    regimes will cover running frequency and distances in some detail.
    The importance of diet, rest, and general well-being will be
    highlighted but often specialist guidance is lacking. There are
    several disciplines from within the complementary therapy community
    that significantly benefit a person training for a marathon. Did
    you know, for example, at the London 2012 Olympics Osteopaths
    joined the medical team supporting and treating the athletes? Or
    that many runners use Acupuncture to improve their performance
    (check out this article in Runners' World).

    At The Maris Practice, they have a number of consultants
    experienced in treating sportsmen and women to help them achieve
    their goals. They are a one-stop-shop for athletes to support their
    overall well-being, vital for competition success.

ST MARGARETS STATION BUM GROPER GETS COMMUNITY SERVICE
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    A sex offender was ordered to complete 150 hours of community
    service after groping a woman's buttock at St Margarets station.

    Ranjit Singh Soni, 36, of Summerwood Road in Isleworth, approached
    the woman in broad daylight, who was waiting for a train on
    November 19, last year.

    He was also ordered to pay total costs of 220 pounds, including
    75 pounds compensation to the victim, at Wimbledon Magistrates'
    Court on Tuesday, January 20.

THE TWICKENHAM JAZZ CLUB IS BACK AT THE CABBAGE PATCH
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    New Year, New Venue and wonderful things are happening
    at Twickenham's long running Jazz Club which now joins the Eel Pie
    Club, TwickFolk and many others at The Famous Cabbage Patch
    in London Road Twickenham.

    Twickenham Jazz Club has had a rocky old road since its original
    conception by local musicians Kelvin and Lesley Christiane over ten
    years ago. Its original venue is now a Tesco mini store, another a
    pizzaria and so it goes on but the intrepid couple have managed
    to continue to create great Jazz Music in our ever changing
    borough, completely against the odds and maintained a very
    committed jazz following.

CONSULTATION: COMMUNITY ROADS AND PAVEMENTS FUND 2015
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Help decide how 35,000 pounds is spent in your local area -
    nominate now!

    In the All in One survey, residents highlighted the condition
    of roads and pavements among their top concerns. In response, the
    Council aims to make available 490,000 pounds to pay specifically
    for community nominated improvements.

    The fourth round of funding is now open for residents to nominate
    more roads and pavements they feel are in need of extra work. This
    is in addition to the regular maintenance work being carried out.

SCHOOLS FOR EAST TWICKENHAM
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    We have been asked to post this on behalf of Schools for
    East Twickenham

    East Twickenham suffers from a severe shortage of primary school
    places, and every year there are many families who cannot find a
    school for their children. There are no schools at present in East
    Twickenham, and the schools in the adjacent villages become filled
    with the children who live close to them.
