THE COMING OF THE HURRICANE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    70 years ago to the day Adolf Hitler was feeling rather pleased 
    with himself. Ever since his unprovoked invasion of Poland on the 
    1st September 1939 his armies had blitzkrieged their way through 
    Denmark, Norway, Holland, Luxembourg and France and nobody had 
    been able to stop them. O.K - He may have been a little miffed 
    that a fleet of small ships had suddenly appeared over the 
    horizon to pull the British Army and their allies off the beaches
    at Dunkirk - but apart from that everything was going swimmingly.
    All that was left to do was to sweep the RAF out of the skies, 
    leaving the way clear for the Fuhrer's final ambition - the 
    invasion of Great Britain.
    
    Winston Churchill knew that an invasion would be next 
    on Hitler's wish list. On the 18th June 1940 he addressed 
    the House of Commons...
    
    "What General Weygand called the "Battle of France" is over.
     I expect that the "Battle of Britain" is about to begin."

 EVENT REMINDER: CANON ANDREW WHITE - 27 MAY 2010

    people at St. George's church, and is the President of the
    'Foundation for Relief and Reconciliation in the Middle East'

    coordinates delivery of humanitarian relief to the people 
    of Baghdad. This includes the St George's clinic, which treats
    over 100 Iraqi's every day.

ANOTHER BOGUS 'CHARITY' IN ST MARGARETS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    W&W Help Limited are collecting in St Margarets on Thursday. W&W 
    Help Limited claim to support a breast cancer prevention programme
    to the tune of 1,500 pounds per month. There is no mention of a 
    specific programme or project.
    
    The Government Charity Commission website has no record of W&W 
    Help.  The company registration number 6296698 on the leaflet 
    does check out on the Companies House website.  W&W Help was 
    dissolved in March 2009.
    
    Please please do not support these people by leaving your unwanted
    items on the doorstep.

INFORMATION: LYME DISEASE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Now the warm weather is here and people are spending more time 
    outdoors they are at greater risk of contracting the illness.
    
    Lyme disease is caused by the bite of an infected tick and causes 
    a range of unpleasant symptoms which may include a circular red 
    rash, headaches, a stiff neck, extreme fatigue, muscle and joint 
    pain, and disturbances of sight, hearing, digestive system and
    sleep. If left untreated it can progress to the joints, the heart
    and the nervous system. If caught early however, it is usually 
    curable with a short course of antibiotics.
    
    Ticks are present in both Richmond Park and Bushy Park and can be 
    found in gardens, parks and woods throughout the country. There 
    are some basic precautions people can take to reduce the risk 
    of being bitten by ticks...
