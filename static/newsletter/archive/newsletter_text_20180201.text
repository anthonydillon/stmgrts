NEW COMMUNITY SAFETY STRATEGY
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Working in partnership to create a borough that is safer for all is
    at the heart of the borough's new Community Safety Strategy, which
    was approved by Richmond Council last week.

    Richmond Community Safety Partnership brings together Richmond
    Council, the Metropolitan Police, probation services, London Fire
    Brigade, the Richmond Clinical Commission Group, schools and
    voluntary groups. All work together to help make the borough a
    safer place to live, work, learn and visit.
