THE GREAT BENEFACTRESS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    If ever there was a growth industry in Old Isleworth it was the
    founding of almshouses. Over the last 400 years these small, well
    built, terraced cottages have provided a secure home for some of
    the district's most vulnerable people. The names of the
    almshouses:- Butler's, Bell's, Farnell's, Ingram's, Rayment's,
    Tolson's and Sermon's are a reminder of the generous benefactors
    who bequeathed money for the benefit of the less fortunate members
    of their community. This is the story of one of them- "a great
    benefactress to the parish."

LADIES! WANT TO BE A ROCK 'N' ROLL STAR?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Can you sing like Brenda Lee? Can you "dooby-doo" like the
    Ronettes? Do you look hot in a 'frou-frou' dress? Are you into the
    popular music of the late 1950's?

    You can? You do? You are?!! Then you might be just the person that
    a St Margarets based 1950's style rock 'n' roll band is looking for!

    'Nark Drool and the Shudders', an excellent and experienced
    semi-pro band, are looking for two female 'chantooses' to provide
    backing and lead vocals on a repertoire of rock 'n' roll classics,
    teen ballads and doo-wop 'heart breakers.'

    Age and experience are immaterial. All that is needed is a good
    voice, enthusiasm and the ability to shake a tail feather!

LOCAL AUTHOR'S MITCH STANSBURY'S NEVER MIND THE BOTOX OUT NOW
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    St Margarets writer Mitch Stansbury has just released his second
    book, describing it as a middle-aged, mid-life crisis
    rock'n'roll diary.

    Never Mind the Botox follows four local residents to tiny music
    halls and enormous fields, as over five years, they re-discover
    live, loud, guitar music. Prompted, and often joined by their
    children, this is a sideways and very light-hearted look at these
    noisy nights out, where suburban chaos meets homicidal
    ticket-touts, deranged baby-sitters, weather armageddon,
    superheroes in spandex, cross-dressing saxophonists and much more.
    From an eighties crooner playing drums in a covers band to the
    biggest rock acts on the planet, and from cricket club bars
    to Wembley Stadium, Never Mind the Botox is a journey full
    of decibels, drama, a little nostalgia, and more than few chuckles.
    There is also of course, some unforgettable dad-dancing, and is
    available from Denham and Finney, 149 St Margarets Road, and
    on Amazon Books

ANY QUALIFIED PROVIDER AND THE NHS REFORMS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    As part of the health reforms brought in by the coalition
    government, the NHS is rolling out AQP contracts for services to
    the patients of local GPs. AQP (Any Qualified Provider) contracts
    will be commissioned by groups of local GPs called CCGs (Care
    Commisioning Groups) for primary healthcare services. These
    services will include musculoskeletal services for back pain and
    neck pain, community wound dressing services, diagnostic imaging
    services among others.

    AQP ensures that the practitioners to whom GPs refer meet the
    standards of organisation and care that an NHS patient requires.
    GPs are confident that any AQP is safe and effective and because
    of this they leave the choice of the AQP to the patient.

    Richmond and Twickenham chose to roll out the AQP for Back Pain and
    Neck Pain, in conjunction with Wandworth PCT, first in the country
    to trial the selection process. It started at the end of September
    2012. On the AQP list is a range of physiotherpists, osteopaths and
    chiropractors in the local area.

AGE UK RICHMOND'S WINTER WELLBEING CAMPAIGN 2012
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Practical advice on keeping you and your home warm, avoiding cold
    related illness such as flu and eating well in the winter

    Winter isn't everyone's favourite season and there's no doubt that
    the cold weather can be a worry for some. Cold weather can lead
    to serious health problems, particularly for people who have a
    long-term health condition or are over 65. With a little
    preparation, and by following some simple suggestions, we can help
    ward off the winter chills.

    The Winter Wellbeing Campaign for 2012/13 has been launched to help
    the residents of the borough of Richmond upon Thames prepare for
    the colder weather. Age UK Richmond, NHS Richmond and Richmond AID
    are working in partnership to deliver the local campaign.

    The campaign aims to help older and more vulnerable people keep
    warm and well this winter. Keeping warm both inside and outside
    your home can help to reduce risk of serious health problems that
    are more common in the colder months, such as chest infections, flu
    and pneumonia.

LOOKING FOR A BAND FOR YOUR PARTY?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Rock and Roll is alive and kicking!

    The locally based Rock and Roll band, Buddy Flame and The Rockets
    have had a successful year playing at parties, Jubilee
    celebrations, fairs and probably the scariest pub in Suffolk and
    would be delighted to entertain your party or event.

    With a great selection of 50's and early 60's songs in their
    repertoire audiences have been jiving and bopping to the tunes that
    started the rock and roll revolution. Have a look a recent video
    from one of the summer Jubilee parties to see more!
