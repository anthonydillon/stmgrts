HIMALAYAN BALSAM
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Once upon a time...
    
    Lizzie was an old and dear friend. One day she introduced me 
    to Laya, one of her close relatives from India. Laya was very 
    nice - tall and elegant and in many ways very similar to dear 
    old Lizzie. When Laya mentioned that she was looking for somewhere
    to stay I offered her my spare room. All seemed well until I 
    discovered that Laya had spread her stuff into the living room, 
    then the bathroom and then the kitchen. Just when I thought that 
    I should probably do something about it  Laya brought in the rest
    of her family - and there were literally thousands of them. All 
    tall, all elegant and all determined to kick me out of my own
    house. Before long they had  taken over the garden, the house 
    next door and the house next door to that. Then the entire street
    disappeared and everyone in it. Even dear friend Lizzie doesn't
    seem to be answering her phone these days.
    
    That is the story of Himalayan Balsam (Impatiens glandulifera) 
    A.K.A The Policeman's Helmet, Indian Touch-Me-Not, Pink Peril, 
    Poor Man's Orchid or Ornamental Jewelweed.

HOLISTIC YOGA CLASSES
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Your children have gone back to school and you are thinking about
    their activities, what about yours?
    
    As we get older we lose our suppleness- this is crucial to our
    skeletal health and to increase our capacity to be mobile for the 
    longest we possibly can. We rush around and until things go wrong 
    that affect our lifestyle and limit things we want to do we ignore
    the needs of our body and mind, and also  our emotional needs.
    
    Yoga is an excellent way to ensure that our body and mind functions
    as efficiently as possible -unwind, relax, focus on yourself and 
    your own needs at the same time maintaining and even improving 
    your fitness of body and mind to keep us active in the long-term.

EVENT REMINDER: REVOLUTIONARY WITNESS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Revolutionary Witness, which I am directing, opens at Hampton Hill
    Playhouse on September 19th, running for seven performances. The
    extra good news is that it's quite a short show - two halves 
    of about 45minutes each. The show comprises personal reflections
    by four minor figures in the French Revolution. Written by Peter 
    Barnes, it has a wonderful vein of sardonic humour, laughter and 
    pain running in parallel. Originally four TV monologues
    commissioned by BBC2, this is the only time the script has ever
    been presented in this format: a theatrical occasion not 
    to be missed.
    
    The performance takes place in the Coward Room, a 53 seat studio
    theatre, and as shows there tend to sell out very quickly, if you 
    want to come, book early. I may not be able to help with a last 
    minute plea. (Contact details are on the attached flyer.) The 
    other thing to be aware of is that on the opening night, Sunday 
    September 19th, the performance starts at 6.00 pm. Otherwise
    at 7.45.
    
    Oh, yes. And latecomers will be shot.

EVENT REMINDER: GASS DAY - 11 SEPTEMBER 2010
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    In 2004 the North St Margarets Residents Association organised a
    'one-off' event that became an annual occurrence and now in its 
    7th year is turning into a tradition - The Grand Annual Street 
    Sale a.k.a GASS Day.
    
    The procedure is simplicity itself. At 1.00pm on Saturday 11th
    September the residents of the NSMRA community will put tables
    outside their houses, cover them with all the things that they 
    no longer need - books, records, toys, clothes and so on - and
    then sell them for knock down prices. It is rather like a car boot
    sale in the street - but without the car or the boot. The range 
    of goods is huge from furniture and designer clothes through 
    to hot dogs, home made cakes, pickles and jams, bric-a-brac, 
    televisions and DVD's. The neighbourhood police come to give 
    advice on home security and to mark bicycles and our local
    church, All Souls, will be involved with a Fair Trade stall 
    and a cafe.
    
    GASS Day is on Saturday 11th September and starts at 1.00pm.
    The streets involved are Haliburton, Heron, Newry, Northcote
    and Talbot. To find them cross the A316, walk up St. Margarets 
    Road towards Isleworth, turn left past the Ailsa Tavern and 
    walk down Northcote Road. Voila!
    
    Adding to the day's sense of community at 2.30pm local kids 
    in fancy dress will parade around the area "Beating the Bounds"
    with willow wands. Although the ritual is pre-Christian the
    children see it as pure "Harry Potter" with the presence
    of a kilted bagpiper adding a touch of "McMagic".
    
    GASS Day pitches are available to residents and non-residents
    alike. The cost of a resident pitch is 2 pounds, for non-residents
    it is 5 quid. Please note that these pitches are 
    for NON-COMMERCIAL purposes only.
    
    For more information or to register a pitch please call Laurence 
    on 0208 400 9822
