ALICE AYRES - A SECULAR SAINT
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    "One by one--
     Nobly done--
     Seeks the children through the smoke,
     Though the red flames break the door,
     Though the white fumes through the floor
     Curl, to stifle and to choke."

    -- 'ALICE AYRES' by Hardwicke Drummond Rawnsley 1896

    If you walk up St Martin's Le Grand from St Pauls towards the
    Barbican in the City of London you will pass on your left a small
    green open space called Postman's Park. This was once the burial
    ground for St Botolph's, Aldersgate but in 1880 it was opened as a
    public garden. In 1900 Postman's Park became the home of George
    Frederic Watt's 'Memorial to Self-Sacrifice', honouring ordinary
    working men and women who gave their lives to save others. Among
    the 54 memorial tablets, remembering such people as Sarah Smith, a
    pantomime artist who died in January 24th 1863 of "terrible
    injuries received when attempting in her inflammable dress
    to extinguish the flames which had enveloped her companion" and
    Leigh Pitt who in June 7th, 2007, "saved a drowning boy from the
    canal at Thamesmead, but sadly was unable to save himself." is a
    ceramic plaque remembering a young woman from Isleworth called
    Alice Ayres.
