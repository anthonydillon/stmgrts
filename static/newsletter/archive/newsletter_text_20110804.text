ï»¿RICHMOND TOPS ENGLAND IN PRIMARY SCHOOL SATS 2011
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Richmond had the highest percentage of children achieving level 4
    or above in both English and maths in the nation at 86% vs the
    national average of 74%. Despite the national average going up
    over last year, there is still some concern at the pass rate
    for level 5.

USE YOUR SENSES AND HIT THE TRAIL IN RICHMOND PARK
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Friends of Richmond Park have just published a new book specially
    designed for families to get the most out of the Park. It's
    called Family Trails and it is now on sale in bookshops and on the
    Friends website, www.frp.org.uk. All profits from sales of the
    book go back to the charity and conservation projects in the Park
    and as the Government has slashed park funding by over 25%, buying
    this book could really help preserve and improve the Park. The book
    also includes a forward by one of the UK's leading
    children's authors, Jacqueline Wilson, a Patron of
    the Friends.
