﻿3 FEBRUARY 1959 - THE DAY THE MUSIC DIED
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    February made me shiver with every paper I'd deliver
    Bad news on the doorstep - I couldn't take one more step
    I can't remember if I cried when I read about his widowed bride
    Something touched me deep inside the day the music died

    AMERICAN PIE by Don McLean

    I remember that morning in February 1959. It was a typical winter
    day, grey and grim, and I was delivering newspapers. Plastered
    over the front page of the 'Daily Mirror' was the headline 'Top
    Rock Stars Die in Crash'. Above it, arms spread, was a photograph
    of J.P Richardson - the Big Bopper - and below, grinning from
    behind his horn rimmed glasses, was my hero, Buddy Holly. They were
    both dead, along with 17 year old Ritchie Valens...

HAVE YOU KEPT YOUR NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION TO KEEP FIT?  WHY NOT WALK?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Breast Cancer Care is imploring supporters across London to take
    action by pulling on their walking boots and challenging themselves
    to a 10 or 20 mile Pink Ribbonwalk at the beautiful Marble Hill
    park on 15th June 2013.

    Breast cancer is the most common cancer in the UK and most people
    know someone dealing with this difficult disease. By pushing
    themselves to go the distance, Pink Ribbonwalk participants can
    show their support for a loved one or help others living with
    breast cancer.

    Breast Cancer Care Ambassador, Lisa Snowdon, who previously walked
    at Marble Hill, said:

    "I went to my first Pink Ribbonwalk last year and I loved it! We
     had lots of laughs along the way and the atmosphere was amazing. I
     met some really inspiring people and there was real solidarity as
     we walked, knowing that, together, we were raising money to help
     fund Breast Cancer Care's vital support services. My grandmother
     died of breast cancer and my aunt also was diagnosed in the past,
     so I grab any opportunity I can to help raise money and awareness
     for this dreadful disease. The Pink Ribbonwalk is a great way to do
     just that so I would encourage everyone to sign up and help us
     to make a difference to the lives of people affected by
     breast cancer."

    It costs just 30 to register to take part but walkers are required
    to raise a minimum of £175 worth of sponsorship to help fund Breast
    Cancer Care's practical and emotional support services. pounds

    Bring family, friends and colleagues together and enjoy a
    fun-filled afternoon walking through beautiful scenery, followed
    by a village fete style celebration, including a medal, free BBQ,
    massage and entertainment!

    Register now to take part at www.pinkribbonwalk.org.uk or call 0870
    145 0101 and if you quote the promo code CARE49 you will be entered
    into a free prize draw to win a pair of tickets to our Carols
    by Candlelight in December.

    No-one should face breast cancer alone. Funds raised from Breast
    Cancer Care's Pink Ribbonwalk in association with womanandhome
    magazine will enable the charity to provide information and support
    services such as its Helpline, discussion forums, local events,
    one-to-one support sessions and website, to enable women to live
    with, through, and beyond breast cancer.
