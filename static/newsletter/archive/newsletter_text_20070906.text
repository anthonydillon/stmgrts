    Residents' Association (NSMRA) is holding its 5th fabulous 
    Great Annual Street Sale next Saturday, 8th September

    Residents are turning out their attics, bookshelves, toy chests

RICHMOND LOCK (BRUNEL SITE) APPEAL DISMISSED
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Planning Inspector has dismissed Octagon's appeal against 
    the Council's refusal of planning permission for:
    
      o the replacement of basement parking by spaces 
        for parking in front of the houses,
     o  the omission of one of the two proposed water 
        features and the reduction in size of the other.


    This is good news indeed, not only for residents of St Margaret's
    but for the Borough's planning system as a whole: it will encourage 
    Council Officers and the Planning Committee to take a robust line 
    in resisting over development and insisting that promises made
    before permissions are granted must be fulfilled. Your ward 
    councilors; Geoff Acton, Ben Khosa and Philip Morgan, fully 
    supported residents on this and had several meetings with 
    residents, Octagon and Council Officers.
