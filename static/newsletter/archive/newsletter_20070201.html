<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2007/02/event_reminder_22.html">Event Reminder: Everyman</a></h3>

<p><img src="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/images/events/everyman_thumb.jpg" width="128" height="184" alt="Everyman" align="right" style="padding: 2px; border: 1px solid #ccc;"/></p>

<p>God sends Death to call Everyman to account. Can he invite his friends and family to his Judgement Day? Where exactly did he leave his good deeds, long, long ago?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/event/Play/200702020348">Everyman</a> is an imaginative mediaeval morality play which straddles the centuries, and tells of the trials and tribulations facing anyone trying to make sense of life.</p>

<p>Director Gerald Baker says:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;The joy of theatre is that one minute you&#8217;re entertained by the songs and jokes of a traditional panto, and the next are confronted by questions as basic as What matters in life? Hopefully we provide that contrast, as our Christmas panto is followed by the rarely seen Everyman.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Shows at Twickenham&#8217;s Mary Wallace Theatre are on Thursday-Saturday, February 8th-10th at 7.45pm, plus a 3pm matinee on Saturday 10th.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2007/02/event_reminder_24.html">Event Reminder: Alce Harfield Exhibition</a></h3>

<p><img src="/images/events/par_ici_alice_thumb.jpg" width="150" height="144" alt="ALCE HARFIELD painting"  align="right" style="padding: 2px; border: 1px solid #ccc;"/></p>

She was born in Sussex in 1966 into an unusually artistic family. She grew up surrounded by photographers, art teachers, architects and printmakers, so it came as no surprise when she embarked on an artistic career of her own.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2007/01/fancy_some_card.html">Fancy Some Cards?</a></h3>


<blockquote><p>&#8220;My husband runs a bridge club. Major events and competitions require new packs of playing cards and over a period of time a back log of slightly used cards builds up. We currently have a couple of hundred packs of these &#8216;pre-used&#8217; playing cards which are looking for a home.</p>

<p>Rather than throw them all away, could anyone locally make use of some or all of them, a school, club or social group maybe?. We live in St Margarets so you can collect or I can deliver locally.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>If you are interested, please <a href="mailto:%6D%61%63%6E%30%35%40%64%69%61%6C%2E%70%69%70%65%78%2E%63%6F%6D">email</a>.</p>
