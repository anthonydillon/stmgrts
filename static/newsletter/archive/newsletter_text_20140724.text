COURSES: SPACE TO BE 8-WEEK MINDFULNESS COURSE - 3 SEPTEMBER TO 29 OCTOBER 2014
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Space to Be will be offering an 8-Week Mindfulness Course
    from September 3rd - October 29th in the Emmanuel Centre, at the
    back of St James Catholic Church in Twickenham.

    Mindfulness is a practice which involves deliberately bringing your
    awareness to the present moment with acceptance and non-judgement.
    Research suggests that meditation and awareness training can boost
    the immune system, significantly reduce stress, improve sleep,
    bolster creativity, reduce the ruminative thinking that leads
    to anxiety and depression and improve relationships with loved ones
    and friends.

    Throughout the course students will be building the muscle
    of awareness through a variety of formal and informal meditations.
    For more details about the course please have a look on the website
    below. All applications must be received by Friday, August 22nd.


    Could mindfulness be your path to less stress and greater
    wellbeing?
