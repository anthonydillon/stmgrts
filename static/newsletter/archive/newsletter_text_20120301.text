ï»¿ST MARGARETS - GET READY TO CELEBRATE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Your local traders are getting ready to celebrate The Queens
    Diamond Jubilee.

    We're going to be turning St Margarets red, white and blue
    to celebrate the Jubilee. A special edition of the My St Margarets
    magazine will be published in May and we're planning a Jubilee gala
    event on Sunday 3rd June.

LEAP YEAR 2012
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    One of the most famous Leap Year traditions is women may propose
    to men during this period. According to custom if they are rejected
    they can claim a silk gown as compensation. One of the people
    apparently responsible for this is Queen Margaret of Scotland
    (1286-1290). In 1288 a law was passed in Scotland stating ... "during
    the rein of hir maist blissit Megeste... at lepe yeare, a mayden
    ladye shal hae liberte to bespeke ye man she like, albeit he
    refuses to taik hir to be his lawful wyfe, he shall be mulcted in
    ye sum of ane pundis..."

    (It is worth noting that:-
    
     a. Queen Margaret who was living in Norway at the time, was only 5
        when this law was passed.
     b. This Queen Margaret of Scotland is not the same Queen Margaret
        of Scotland (1045-1093) who was canonised in 1250 as St Margaret
        and whose name we have borrowed for our own small corner
        of paradise.
     )

    We are at the beginning of a Leap Year with 366 days to look
    forward to rather than the standard 365 and this is the week when
    the additional day makes its appearance -- 29th February.

DREAMCATCHER FILM CAMPS GO ON DESPITE CLOSURE OF STUDIOS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    We're all sad here at Dreamcatcher Media that Twickenham Film
    Studios have gone into administration. The studios have been home
    to our 5 day Film Camps for several years now and its back alleys
    and rooms have been put to very creative uses as locations for our
    enthusiastic young filmmakers! We thank the studios for their
    support and sponsorship for the last few years and send all the
    helpful staff there our good wishes at this difficult time.

    In the meantime, we will continue to run an Easter Film Camp at
    Cole Court, London Road, Twickenham - only a stone's throw
    from Twickenham railway station and within walking distance of St
    Margarets. Due to the bank holiday, we will run for 4 days this
    time from 2nd to 5th April. We may add additional dates so if these
    dates don't suit, let us know.

    For those readers whose children may not have attended the Camps
    previously, children aged 8-17 are taught the basics of film
    production and then form a production team to make their own short
    film. Along the way, they get to play all the different production
    roles from director and scriptwriter to cameraperson and sound
    operator. It's an amazing, fun learning experience. You can read
    more about the film camps at www.dreamcatchermedia.co.uk.

    For enquiries please call 0208 607 7273 or
    email davidok@dreamcatchermedia.co.uk.

A NEW FAIR IN TWICKENHAM
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    V&A Fairs take great pleasure in announcing they have been invited
    to organise an Antiques, Vintage & Collectors Fair at Richmond
    upon Thames Community Sports Hall in Twickenham, starting on Sunday
    1st April 2012. This fair will be followed by three further dates
    during the year on 10th June, 2nd September and 4th November.

    This quality fair which has the capacity to hold 80 inside stands
    is conveniently situated on the main A316, next to The Stoop
    Memorial Ground (home of the Harlequins Rugby Club) and opposite
    the world famous Twickenham Rugby Ground, being only 20 minutes
    from Central London! The venue also has the added bonus of offering
    free parking for everyone and has excellent flat unloading access
    for standholders. V&A Fairs who are renowned for their high profile
    marketing will be promoting this new event with newspaper/trade
    advertising, radio, web coverage, wide spread poster/flyer
    distribution and road signage. The combination of a superb
    location, free parking, extensive marketing, competitive stand
    prices and a successful track record from V&A Fairs, will certainly
    make this a very popular event with everyone during 2012.

LOOKING GOOD MARTYN DAY!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    When we opened this Saturday's Guardian, the last thing we thought
    we would see staring back at us was our own Martyn Day. But there
    he was in his Nark Drool Crepe and Drape!

    "When I put on my outfit, I do feel a bit mean. I feel mean, moody
    and magnificent."

    Martyn, you look great!
