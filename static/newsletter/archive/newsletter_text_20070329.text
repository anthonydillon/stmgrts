EVENT REMINDER: 2X2 OPERA'S CARMEN
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    2x2 Opera returns with its fourth production later this month with
    Keith Cheetham's 70 minute adaptation of Bizet's Carmen.  Once
    again, the production draws on the talents of children and young
    people from local schools both on and off stage. Schools taking
    part this year include St Stephen's, Orleans Park, Waldegrave,
    Hampton, Putney High, and Esher College.  We are delighted
    to welcome back Chris Colley (who appeared in The Little Sweep
    and A Very Magical Flute ) in the role of Escamillio this year,
    together with Kimberly Robinson ( A Very Magical Flute ) as Carmen.
    New to the ranks are Robert Tuohy, a recent graduate of the Royal
    Academy of Music, as conductor, together with Jonathan Stoughton
    as Don Josï¿½.

COUNCIL REVIEWS MOORMEAD CHARGES TO REACH AGREEMENT WITH SCHOOL
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    "After having read about St Stephen's School's concerns about
     their bill for use of Moormead in the press, the Council started
     a review, in order to find an amicable agreement.

     To date we have met with the contractors who manage sports
     bookings -- Veolia and reviewed the current prices and use of
     Moormead by St Stephens and all other schools who use pitches
     in other parks in a similar way.

     We have checked and the rates being applied for the use booked
     by the school are correct, using the rates set annually by the
     Council, since St Stephen's do make a lot of use of the site.
     The rates have not increased (except by 2.5% in line with
     inflation) but the school is now booking and being charged
     for all formal use of the park."
