ï»¿THE RETURN OF THE TWANG!
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    "It came up in the studio as a joke one day. Someone said, that
    sounds 'twangy' - and that cracked everyone up. For some reason a
    couple of people had never heard the word before - and after that
    it became a joke - like "Is that 'twangy' enough? So when we put
    the first album out the producer Lee Hazelwood thought it would be
    funny to call it "Have Twangy Guitar, Will Travel"...and it stuck
    with me every since."

           -- DUANE EDDY - "Front Row" - BBC Radio 4 . 28th June 2011

    In April 1960 I went with my friend Dave Cooper to Finsbury Park
    Empire and our very first pop concert. It was a freezing cold rainy
    night and the Finsbury Park Empire was a dump and within a month
    of being closed for ever but we didn't care. We were only 14 and
    the star of the show that night was our hero, the guitar playing
    "twang meister" Duane Eddy.

POP-UP OPERA AT THE TURKS HEAD - 12 JULY 2011
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Pop-up Opera is an innovative touring opera company which takes
    opera to unusual venues. We bring opera to bars, boats, barns, and
    all sorts of unexpected places. Productions are uniquely adapted
    to each individual venue but will maintain the highest professional
    standards. The originality of the settings will reveal the
    universal appeal of opera.

    We are touring a production of Donizetti's comic opera Don
    Pasquale, with four singers and piano, and our director, who adapts
    the production uniquely to each venue. We are performing the opera
    at the Turk's Head pub in St Margarets on Tuesday 12th July.
