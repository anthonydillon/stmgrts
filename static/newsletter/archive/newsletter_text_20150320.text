ï»¿WOLF HALL PART 2 - WHEN ONE VICAR TURNED AGAINST ANOTHER
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    THE STORY SO FAR... In 1533 the King, Henry 8th, broke with the
    authority of Rome and the Catholic Church, married his second wife
    Anne Boleyn and proclaimed himself Supreme Head of the Church
    of England. Many objected and there were some who voiced their
    opinion quite openly but they were quickly rounded up by the King's
    Chief Minister Thomas Cromwell and silenced - by the axe and the
    hangman's noose. Amongst their number were two local clerics, John
    Hale, the vicar of Isleworth and Robert Feron, the vicar
    of Teddington.

THINKING OF A SPRINGTIME MOVE?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    At long last, spring is in the air! It's that time of year we think
    about giving our home a good old spring clean - out with the old
    and in with the new. It's also the most popular season to buy or
    sell property, with flowers in bloom and lighter evenings.

    If you are thinking of moving to a smaller or more manageable
    property, sheltered accommodation, care home, rented or owned
    property, we can help you make the right choices.

    Interested? Please call 0845 600 1090 for more information or
    visit www.ageukrichmond.org.uk

    Working in partnership with Seamless Relocation.
