LOCAL SCHOOL CANCELS MOSQUE TRIP
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Orleans Infant School headteacher defends decision to cancel mosque
    trip over terror attack fears

    A headteacher today defended her decision to cancel a school trip
    to a mosque over fears of revenge attacks in the wake of the death
    of Osama bin Laden.

    Pupils from Orleans Infant School, St Margarets, were due to visit
    Hounslow Mosque today as part of their studies on major faiths.

    But letters were sent to parents last week saying the year 1 trip
    was to be cancelled over safety fears following the death of the
    Al-Qaeda leader on May 2.

    Jane Evans, headteacher of the school in Hartington Road, said her
    "first duty" was the safety of pupils at the school.

DYLAN AT 70: I TOLD BOB DYLAN HE WAS DEAD
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Bob Dylan, a.k.a Robert Zimmerman, has just marked his 70th
    birthday. I was going to say he has just celebrated his 70th
    birthday -- but I'm not sure that the Bob does celebrations. He was
    born on 24th May 1941 -- and he's still going strong. This article
    was first published on this site in 2008.

    --

    In the summer of 1969 I told Bob Dylan he was dead. He hadn't heard
    the news at the time but he didn't appear to be too bothered.
    Perhaps, like the rest of us who had made it through the Sixties,
    Bob had become inured to rock deaths - including his own. Since
    Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper had died in that
    plane crash in February 1959 a whole gang of rockers had joined the
    great tour bus in the sky - Eddie Cochran, Otis Redding, the
    Bar-Kays, Brian Jones, Johnny Kidd, Sam Cooke, Bobby Fuller, Johnny
    Burnette, Joe Meek, Frankie Lymon and countless others. There was
    one major difference however. They really were dead and Bob Dylan
    wasn't but it didn't matter. The story going round in the summer
    of '69 said he was and the rumour carried just enough fact to make
    it seem plausible.
