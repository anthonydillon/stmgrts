ï»¿THE HONGERWINTER
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Almost exactly seventy years ago, at the end of April 1945, an
    unusual activity was taking place on Bomber Command airfields
    across England. Although the war in Europe had only 10 more days
    left to run, the ground crews and armourers were as busy as ever
    but instead of loading their aircraft with bombs they were filling
    the bomb bays with sacks of food.

    Between 29th April and 8th May 1945 the Royal Air Force, the Royal
    Canadian Air Force and the United States Army Air Forces were
    to drop over 11,000 tons of food into those parts of the
    Netherlands still occupied by German forces, to help save the
    civilian population from starvation. It was a period in Dutch
    history remembered as the 'Hongerwinter' (Hunger winter).

LORD FELLOWES BECOMES PATRON OF THE MUSEUM OF RICHMOND
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Museum of Richmond is honoured to announce that Julian, Lord
    Fellowes of West Stafford, has very kindly agreed to become a
    Patron of the Museum.

    He said, in accepting the invitation, "I admire and support the
    museum and I would like to be a patron very much."

    Lord Fellowes has already been a great friend of the Museum, having
    given talks in 2009 and 2013 in aid of the Museum's renewal appeal.
    He also lent the Museum the portrait of his paternal great, great,
    great, great aunt, Georgina Gill, daughter of Admiral Sir Thomas
    Fellowes, for its exhibition "Living and Dying in Nineteenth
    Century Richmond". The photograph below shows him with the portrait
    when he opened the exhibition in March 2013.
