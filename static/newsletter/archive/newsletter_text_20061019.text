:: ST MARGARETS COMMUNITY WEBSITE NEWSLETTER :: 

19 October 2006

Welcome to the St Margarets Community Website Newsletter. 
Each Thursday we will send you the latest news and events from the website (https://stmargarets.london).

LATEST NEWS
===========================================================



NO NEWS NEXT WEEK
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    There will be no updates to the site or newsletter next week as I 
    am finally taking a holiday.

    Also, if you can avoid it, please stop making little comments on 
    the site about things like 'this picture is out of date' or about
    text that obviously was pasted from a press release (e.g. 'genuine
    scam' from the police). While the site has some amazing people
    helping, there is only one person with a very full time job and
    full time life that has to do all the typing, picture taking and 
    updating. Occasionally I cut corners and just paste that poorly
    written note in, or don't run up to the high street to update 
    a photo.
    
    If on the other hand you would like to channel your inner 
    editor/journalist/photographer and help the site, I would love 
    you hear from you. Please email me at editor@stmgrts.org.uk.




HIGH STREET TRANSFORMATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    At present, there seven shops on our little high street that have
    just or are about to change.  Currently it looks a little 
    depressing, but hopefully things will be a bit brighter in a few
    month's time.  We should note that not all details have been 
    confirmed, but we have been informed of all details by several 
    reliable sources and feel comfortable to print them now.

PARCEL DELIVERY SERVICE (PDS) SCAM WARNING
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    A card is posted through your door from a company called PDS 
    (Parcel Delivery Service) suggesting that they were unable to 
    deliver a parcel and that you need to contact them on 0906 6611911
    (a premium rate number). DO NOT call this number as this is a mail
    scam originating from Belize.

ST MARGARETS FAIR RACE NIGHT SUCCESS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    On 6 October, the St Margarets Fair Committee held a 'Race Night'
    event at the St Margarets Church Hall to raise money for local 
    schools and community projects.  The night was a big success with
    over 100 people enjoying wine, cheese and virtual horse racing.

GOVERNMENT CONSULTATION ON RUNWAY ALTERNATION POSTPONED AGAIN
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Government has postponed for a second time the consultation 
    on its controversial plans to end runway alternation in West 
    London.  The Department has admitted that 'ministers have yet to 
    reach final decisions' on the consultation, which was originally 
    expected in March and then scheduled for October.
