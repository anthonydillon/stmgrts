ï»¿MOTHERING SUNDAY - 18 MARCH 2012
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    "All right, but apart from the sanitation, medicine, education,
     wine, public order, irrigation, roads, the fresh water system and
     public health, what have the Romans ever done for us?"

    -- REG: The Life of Brian

    In a roundabout way they created Mothering Sunday.

    In pre-Christian times, at the time of the vernal equinox,
    during the mid March festival of Hilaria, the Romans paid homage
    to the goddess Cybele, the 'Magna Mater' or Great Mother. The rites
    included nine days of abstinence, whipping, scourging and ever
    popular castration rituals. With the coming of Christianity Hilaria
    was absorbed into the liturgical calendar as Laetare Sunday,
    celebrated on the fourth Sunday in Lent in honour of Mary, the
    mother of Christ and the mother church. Laetare Sunday became known
    as Mothering Sunday.

    require.

A VISION FOR TWICKENHAM SORTING OFFICE - 23 TO 24  MARCH 2012
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    A Community Planning Weekend

    You are invited to attend this Vision for Twickenham Sorting Office
    Community Planning Weekend to participate in creating a new Vision
    for the future this important site.

    St James (part of the Berkeley Group) has recently purchased the
    former Sorting Office site with a view to bringing forward
    residential led, mixed use proposals. The aim is to meet the
    aspirations of the emerging Twickenham Area Action Plan and deliver
    a development of high quality, which enhances this important part
    of Twickenham and is well integrated with the surrounding area. St
    James has appointed John Thompson & Partners (JTP) as architects
    for the scheme and to facilitate the community planning process.

    Community Planning is a way of engaging with the local community
    and partners to shape the future of their towns and neighbourhoods.
    At the Community Planning Weekend you will have the opportunity
    to take part in workshops, walkabouts and hands-on planning groups
    to discuss key issues and develop ideas relating to the
    regeneration of the site. This event will be an opportunity to
    share local knowledge and contribute to the emerging Vision for the
    site. Pop in for a short while, a few hours or stay for the entire
    time if you can. Team members will be on hand to explain
    what's happening.

    Following the public workshop days the team led by JTP will analyse
    and summarise the outcomes and develop an illustrated Vision for
    the Sorting Office site. It will be held at 7pm on Wednesday 25
    April 2012 at RACC.
