60 YEARS AGO - FIVE DAYS IN DECEMBER
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    December 1952 started very cold. London found itself covered in a
    thick freezing fog which was unable to disperse because of an
    overlying cap of warmer air. In those days most homes were heated
    by open fires, so faced with the intense cold and fog Londoners
    began to burn more coal than usual. Concentrations of pollutants
    produced by the low quality, high sulphur coal increased 10 fold.
    One air quality reading measured 1,000 tonnes of smoke particles,
    2,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide, 140 tonnes of hydrochloric acid and
    14 tonnes of fluorine compounds in London's air. There was also 370
    tonnes of sulphur dioxide which converted into 800 tonnes
    of sulphuric acid. The smoke and the fog combined to form Smog - a
    dense, yellow blanket that stank of rotten eggs and obscured light
    and ultimately life.

    Over eighty St Margarets senior residents enjoyed a free Christmas
