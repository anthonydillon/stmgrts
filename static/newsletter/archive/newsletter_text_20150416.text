ï»¿WHY WAS EASTER SO EARLY THIS YEAR?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Of all the really big questions being asked over the Easter holiday
    this year - like "How come Fireman Stevie won 'The Voice' and not
    flame haired Lucy who really can sing?" and "When will David
    Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nigel Farage finally realise that they
    were beaten hollow in the Leaders Debate by smarter and spin-doctor
    free Nicola Sturgeon, Leanne Wood and Natalie Bennett?" the one
    question that foxes us all is "Why was Easter so flipping early?"

GET READY FOR THE 2015 CROWN ROAD COMMUNITY SUMMER FAIR!
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Sunday the 7th June on Crown Road, 11am - 5pm!

    After the success of last year's musical fair, Crown Road will
    again be closed to traffic so the St Margarets Traders Association
    can bring you a day of family entertainment!

    There'll be live music all day in the St Margarets Tavern's Car
    Park from an eclectic mix of great bands, a street market
    with diverse stalls, a petting zoo, rides and attractions, fun and
    games for all the family!

    So put it in your diary and we'll see you there! Watch this space
    for more information...

    If you would like to get involved please
    email: pr@mystmargarets.com.
    Limited spaces for stalls are still available but please act quick
    to avoid disappointment.

    Earlier on the same day it's the Turks Head 10k Fun Run, so join
    in the fun of both events and let's make St Margarets the place
    to be!
