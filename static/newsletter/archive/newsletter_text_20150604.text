LOOKING FOR HEROES!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    THE FOLLOWING AWARDS HAVE BEEN APPROVED IN CONNECTION WITH THE
    RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF FOR SERVICES RENDERED
    BY PETTY OFFICERS AND MEN OF THE GRAND FLEET IN THE ACTION IN THE
    NORTH SEA ON 31ST MAY- 1ST JUNE 1916:-

    THE KING HAS BEEN GRACIOUSLY PLEASED TO APPROVE THE GRANT OF THE
    VICTORIA CROSS TO:

    BOY, FIRST CLASS, JOHN TRAVERS CORNWELL, O.N.J 42563 (DIED 2ND
    JUNE, 1916), FOR THE CONSPICUOUS ACT OF BRAVERY.

    LONDON GAZETTE - 15TH SEPTEMBER 1916


    ‘Jack’ Cornwell was only 16½ when he died. Like most working-class
    lads from the East End he left school at the age of 14 and found a
    job. He was a keen member of his local Scout Troop and was once
    praised for rescuing a girl stuck in a drain. Just like hundreds
    of thousands of other lads Jack had joined Baden-Powell’s newly
    established youth movement to find adventure and a direction for
    his life.

ONLINE SURVEY: YOUR VISION, YOUR ST MARGARETS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    London Borough of Richmond upon Thames would like residents,
    businesses, community groups and organisations to help
    with improving the St Margarets Village area. This will include
    helping to shape:

     - How current Council policy impacts on planning and development and
       how best to protect and enhance your areas character and
       conservation areas
     - Aspirations for your community that contribute to its character and
       feel to make it a desirable place to live such as strengthening
       opportunities to get involved or tackling isolation of the elderly

    This is the first stage of consultation when we would like your
    views on your local area and community today and for the future.
    Your feedback will be used to create an updated Village Plan for St
    Margarets that will be published in the Autumn 2015.

    The second formal stage of consultation will take place
    during September and October 2015 and will focus solely on the
    local planning guidance for St Margarets before it is adopted
    in late 2015.

    Take the online survey by 29 June 2015
