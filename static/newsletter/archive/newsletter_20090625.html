<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2009/06/take_the_st_margarets_alliance_survey.html">Take the St Margarets Alliance Survey</a></h3>

<p><img src="http://www.stmargaretsalliance.com/imgs/logo1.jpg" alt="St Margarets Alliance" width="169" height="188" align="right" /></p>

<p><em>St Margarets Alliance Survey takes lead in Sustainable Community Act, seeking views for its Community Action Plan</em></p>

<p>This week the St Margarets Alliance <a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/sma_survey" title="which you can take online">distributed a survey</a> as the first stage towards a Community Action Plan.  The Survey asks residents to consider which aspects of their local environment, economy, or social well-being are most important to them and to prioritise the most important and urgent.</p>

<p>St Margarets Alliance covers the voting ward of St Margarets and North Twickenham.  It is made up of representatives from the North St Margarets Residents&#8217; Association, Moormead Residents, Amyand Park Residents, St Margarets Traders and others.</p>

<p>The group is so far best known as the organisation behind St Margarets&#8217; Crown Road summer and Christmas events &#8212; including the recent Family Fun Day on Sunday 14<sup>th</sup> June.</p>

<p>The group is non party-political and its purpose is to coordinate a Community Action Plan for the area. St Margarets Alliance does not have a specific agenda for the St Margarets area: the results of the Survey will form the basis for the basis of all future initiatives.  The group&#8217;s guiding principle is &#8216;residents first&#8217;.</p>

<p>Discuss Richmond Council plans to change the school to a two form entry school with classes from Reception to Year 6.</p>

<p><a href="http://stmgrts.org.uk/event/meeting/200705142160">Meeting starts at 7pm on 25 June.</a></p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2009/06/proposed_development_to_the_rear_of_3755_orchard_r.html">Proposed Development to the Rear of 37-55 Orchard Road</a></h3>

<p>I would like to bring to your attention the proposed development that, if approved, would be build between the <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">A316 </span></span></span>and the homes on the south side of Orchard Road. It would consist of two (2) three-bedroom houses and two (2) one-bedroom flats. These houses and flats would result in more traffic, more demand for parking spaces, (to say nothing of the havoc caused during construction) and is just another attempt by a developer to over-develop our neighbourhood for their financial gain.</p>

<p>In November of last year, when the Council asked the households which would be most immediately affected by this development to give their views on the proposal, 29 households lodged their objections - none supported it. The developer (with the guidance of the Planning Department) has since submitted numerous reports in an attempt to override the many objections cited by residents. Their last report, a parking survey, was sent to Planning on 10 June. I understand from Bryan Staff (in Planning) that his office will soon consider its decision. If you haven&#8217;t done so already might I urge you to look at the developer&#8217;s application and let Planning know your views.</p>

<p>This development, if built, would place a further burden on already limited parking in the area, generate more traffic on our neighbourhood roads, would be unsafe as there is insufficient access for emergency vehicles, and would result in damage or loss of trees on the adjoining properties, among other objections. The construction period would cause increased traffic congestion and noise pollution.</p>
