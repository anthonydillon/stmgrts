OUR SECOND EVER READER POLL
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Well, it isn't exactly our six year anniversary, but we are looking
    at a bit of a redesign, so we thought we should run our second ever
    Reader Poll to see how we are doing. It would be great if you could
    spare us five minutes of your time to help us know what is working
    and what isn't.

    The site has been doing fairly well considering we don't directly
    market the site. However, we know there is a lot more that we could
    be doing, but we need a lot more help. So if you want to help
    with writing, typing, finding events, or helping get the word out,
    please let us know in the 2011 Reader Poll

    o  take the poll

KING DINUZULU'S BEADS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Last month two sets of beads, modelled on those once worn by the
    great Zulu chief King Dinuzulu kaCetshwayo, came to St Margarets.


    Dinuzulu, the son of the mighty warrior Cetshwayo, was King of the
    Zulu nation from 1884 until his death in 1913. As a sign of his
    royalty and courage in battle he wore around his neck a 4 metre
    long 'iziQu' - a necklace made of thousands of small wooden acacia
    beads strung on a leather thong. The necklace, passed down
    from generation to generation, was considered sacred and kept in a
    cave on a high mountain and guarded day and night. The explorer
    Charles Rawden Maclean who was shipwrecked off the coast of
    Zululand in 1825 wrote...

     "The most curious part of these decorations consisted 
      of several rows of small pieces of wood ... strung 
      together and made into necklaces and bracelets ... 
      On enquiry we found that the Zulu warriors set great 
      value on these apparently useless trifles, and that they
      were orders of merit. Each row was the distinguishing
      mark of some great heroic deed, and the wearer had 
      received them from King Shaka's own hand."

EVENT REMINDER: ART PICNIC AT JWM TURNERS HOUSE - 20 FEBRUARY 2011
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Come to an Environment Trust Art Picnic at the house of J M W
    Turner on Sunday 20th February 2011 from 11am to 4pm.

    A fascinating new venue, not open to the public, made available
    to us by the Sandycombe Lodge Trust. The painter JMW Turner
    designed and lived in this house from 1812 to 1826. Much of the
    original internal architectural detail remains, with an arched and
    mirrored entrance hall thought to have been inspired by Turner's
    friend the architect Sir John Soane. Empty, unmodernised and a
    little shabby, the interior offers challenging opportunities
    for capturing the evocative atmosphere before restoration takes
    place; or you could paint the view through the windows. And you can
    certainly imagine Turner cleaning his brushes in the
    basement kitchen.

    Materials for sketching (paper, pencils, and charcoal) and drawing
    boards will be provided, but you are welcome to bring your own
    equipment if you prefer. Don't forget to bring a picnic lunch too.

EVENT REMINDER: ECO TEAMS TRAINING SESSION - 16 FEBRUARY 2011
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    On 16th February from 6 to 8pm at the Twickenham Library.

    Are you interested in being 'greener', as well as saving money
    but having trouble knowing where to start?

    Would you be keen to find out more about an exciting, free 6 month
    scheme with fellow residents in a friendly environment?

    Richmond Environment Network will be hosting a free Eco Teams
    training event on Wednesday 16th February at Twickenham Library.
    The session will be two hours in length, providing you with all the
    tools and information you need to get involved with an Eco Team. An
    Eco Team will progress for a period of 6 months focusing on themes
    such as energy, water and waste.
