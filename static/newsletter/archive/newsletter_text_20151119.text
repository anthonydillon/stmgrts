LATEST NEWS
===========================================================



ï»¿THE LOCK BUSTERS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    This is the time of the annual River Thames 'Draw-Off'. You may
    have noticed. The weirs at Richmond Lock have been raised and the
    river allowed to settle down to its natural depth and flow. For
    long periods of the day, from Richmond Lock to Teddington, the
    river is now un-navigable for larger vessels. Local boat people
    know that and on 19th February 1944 so did the German Luftwaffe.

CHRISTMAS SHOPPING AT TURNER'S HOUSE - 29 NOVEMBER 2015
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Sunday, 29 November 11am to 4pm

    Join Turner's House Trustees for a glass of wine while picking
    up delightful and original Christmas gifts for friends and family -
    all to support the Trust's restoration appeal.

    The first Turner's House Christmas Fair was hugely popular and
    there have been many early requests for another. This year you will
    find an even wider choice of gifts not to be found on the
    High Street.

    Annie Simpson is back with her beautiful scarves made in fine
    merino and lustrous silk fibres, all inspired by specific Turner
    paintings - a perfect gift for Turner lovers.
