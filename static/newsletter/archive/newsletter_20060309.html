<h3>New Soft Play Space for St Margarets Proposed</h3>

<p><img src="https://stmargarets.london/assets/images/2006/Drawing-playarea-thumb.jpg" width="150" height="112" alt="drawing of layout" align="right"/></p>

<p>On, 24th Februrary 2006, an application was submitted to the Richmond Council for planning permission to convert a unit in the St Margarets&#8217; Business Centre from a light industrial (B1) to an indoor soft play area (D2). The applicant is a local resident and parent, Dipesh Bhoola, who is hoping to open an indoor play space like Hugo&#8217;s in Richmond or Snakes n&#8217; Ladders in Syon Park.</p>

<h3>New Organic Nursery for St Margarets</h3>

<p>First Learning, an &#8216;organic nursery&#8217;, who currently operates a single nursery in Shepperton, is hoping to open its second branch in St Margarets at 389 St Margarets Road near Talbot Road. First Learning is the first and only Soil Association, certified nursery in the <span class="caps">UK.</span> The site in St Margarets would be the company&#8217;s second establishment. The current building is empty with &#8220;acute structural problems.&#8221; First Learning is hoping to open an organic food shop in the front of the property and build a nursery at the back.</p>

<h3>Wine Bar Gets Conditional Planning Permission</h3>

<p><img src="https://stmargarets.london/images/hot/hot_ParVinu-logo.gif" alt="Par Vinu Logo" height="46" width="100" align="right" /></p>

<p>On 2nd March 2006, the Richmond Council Planning Committee Meeting gave &#8216;conditional permission&#8217; for the proposed wine bar in the basement formerly occupied by Phelps.</p>

<p>The meeting was held before a completely full room. After speakers for both sides, councillor questions and planning&#8217;s advice, the application was conditionally approved by a 5-3 vote, with local councillors Cllr Hambidge supporting and Cllrs Lamb and Trigg (Twickenham Riverside) against. The &#8216;conditions&#8217; are that; a Travel Plan is agreed, Air Conditioning plans are approved, only a 2am New Year&#8217;s license is given and only &#8216;personal permission&#8217; is given.</p>

<p>Personal Permission, meaning that planning permission is only given to one of the principles of the wine bar and if they leave the venture for any reason, the new owner would have to get another planning approval, is considered a protection against the sale or change of the venue into something else, but also a potentially tough limit to the applicants, making it harder for them to raise money.</p>

<h3>Moormead Park Meeting</h3>

<p>Following on from the original meeting, another meeting of interested residents and groups is being called for Thursday, 9 March at 7.30pm in the Turks&#8217; Head, Winchester Hall.</p>

<p>The purpose of the meeting is to agree the key areas for refurbishment, begin the process of looking at fund-raising ideas for supporting these, in partnership with the Council and are hoping to form a representative local group &#8212; <em>Friends of Moormead Park</em>.</p>

<p>Anyone interested in being involved in the discussion, and in particular the fundraising, please let Claire Wilson know; email <a href="mailto:%63%6F%72%70%75%6E%69%74%40%61%6F%6C%2E%63%6F%6D">corpunit@aol.com</a> or call 020 8744 0700. </p>
