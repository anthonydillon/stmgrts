TWO CROSSES
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    "In Flanders fields the poppies blow
     Between the crosses, row on row,
     That mark our place; and in the sky
     The larks, still bravely singing, fly"

     -- John McCrae

    Hanging on the wall inside All Souls Church, Haliburton Road
    in north St Margarets, are two plain wooden crosses. They once
    stood in the mud of Flanders, over the makeshift graves
    of 2nd Lt Geoffrey Wilkins and Corporal Lawrence Richards, local
    men killed in the First World War. Following the Armistice, when
    the dead were gathered into formal cemeteries under uniform
    headstones, the two wooden crosses were sent back to the church
    that both men had attended. Now they stand like sentries
    on either side of a hand lettered Roll of Honour listing all
    the men from the parish who were killed in the Great War.
    Underneath the names is this carved caption:-

      "In the year 1914 England waged war against Germany
       that faith should be kept between nations and life
       might be ordered by right and not by violence.
       For this end Englishmen left their homes and fought
       and suffered for 4 years. Amongst them men
       of this parish of whom 86 lost their lives in helping
       to gain the victory. Wherefore their names are
       enshrined above in grateful and loving memory and
       in hope that their deeds and sacrifice may inspire
       Englishmen for all time."

    Who were these 86 men from St Margarets? What do we know about
    them? There were the two Cope brothers, Robert and Henry, who
    lived in Northcote Road. They died within 2 months of each other.
    Robert, a private with the London Regiment, was 23 when he was
    killed in action in October 1916 at Thiepval.  His older brother
    Henry died from wounds in December 1916 at Etaples the main
    British depot in France and location of the notorious
    "Bullring" training camps. He was 29 and a rifleman with the
    29th Rifle Brigade.
