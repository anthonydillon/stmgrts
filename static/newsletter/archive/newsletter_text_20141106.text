ï»¿THE WAR WALK #1 - FROM THE AILSA TO YPRES
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Five years ago the North St Margarets Residents Association, NSMRA,
    began researching the lives of 86 local men whose names are
    recorded on the World War 1 'Roll of Honour' in All Souls Church,
    in Haliburton Road. With the information gathered, on Saturday
    October 25th NSMRA was able to organise a "War Walk" around our
    neighbourhood, visiting some of their homes and learning something
    about the families that once lived there. Here are some of those
    WW1 stories from our own streets...

ISLEWORTH PROMENADE - A NEW FRIENDS GROUP?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    South West London Environment Network is a charity that enables and
    empowers people to protect and improve their local environment. We
    are interested in working with local residents to establish a
    Friends of Isleworth Promenade. Friends of parks groups are very
    popular resident-led groups that work in partnership with the
    Council to bring about improvements for local green spaces. In
    August 2014, at the request of some local residents, Richmond
    Council's Community Links Team organised two volunteer work days
    with local residents and Councillors along Isleworth Promenade
    clearing some of the overgrown vegetation to re-establish the
    fantastic views of the Thames, and removing plants such as fast
    growing Himalayan Balsam to allow the Purple Loosestrife to
    flourish for pollinating insects!
