THE ANGELS OF MONS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    "'Heaven's Knight, aid us!'

    And as the soldier heard these voices he saw before him, beyond the
    trench, a long line of shapes, with a shining about them. They were
    like men who drew the bow, and with another shout their cloud
    of arrows flew singing and tingling through the air towards the
    German hosts."

    -- ARTHUR MACHEN 'The Bowmen' pub. 29th Sept 1914

    The British Expeditionary Force, the BEF, had its first major
    encounter with the German Army, the 'Deutsches Heer', near Mons
    in Belgium on the 22nd/23rd of August 1914. Although they were
    heavily outnumbered the British troops were able to hold the
    Germans back for about 24 hours until eventually forced into a
    rapid retreat. Following this sobering experience the British
    public began to realise that defeating Germany was not going to be
    as easy as they first thought.

LONDONERS INVITED TO VISIT CAPITAL'S HIDDEN GEMS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Get on your bikes or put your best foot forward to raise much
    needed funds for London's places of worship!

    On Saturday 20 September 2014, Londoners are invited to walk, run
    or cycle to visit religious buildings. The less energetic can also
    take part as many of these buildings are on major public transport
    routes, so top up your Oyster cards now!

    Local community groups, congregations, friends, school groups,
    family and individuals will all be getting out and about to see
    as many places of worship as possible in one day - by bike, on
    foot, or by public transport. This is a wonderful opportunity
    to dust off your hiking boots, bicycles, running shoes or Oyster
    cards and set out to discover some of London's amazing
    faith buildings.

HILL VIEW ROAD AND PAVEMENT IMPROVEMENTS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    As a part of our Borough wide programme to improve roads and
    pavements we will be carrying out footway maintenance works in Hill
    View Road, Twickenham. The works will generally consist of
    re-laying defective kerbs and footway surface repairs.

    We also intend to widen the pavement on the southside of the road
    from the bridge to the junction of Moor Mead Road to allow
    for easier pedestrian access due to the tree roots which have
    caused the pavement to become uneven. These works will be carried
    out by our appointed contractor, F M Conway Ltd.

    The works will start week commencing 15th September 2014,
    between 8am and 5pm and are expected to be completed within
    11 weeks.

    In order to facilitate the above works it will be necessary
    to impose some temporary parking restrictions in the road. The
    restricted length will be adequately marked with high visibility
    cones. Please do not park in 'No Waiting' coned area as parked
    vehicles can delay the progress and incur additional costs to
    the Council.

AN ICE RINK AT STRAWBERRY HILL HOUSE
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    We are pleased to announce that this year Richmond Rink is moving
    to the beautiful setting of Strawberry Hill House. We will be able
    to provide more facilities, with a slightly larger rink, and
    with the wonderful backdrop of the house's white turrets and
    stained glass windows.

    Details of the planning application can be seen via the link
    below and we would welcome any comments submitted in support of our
    application, which can be submitted online:

    Planning Application No.: 14/3393

    We look forward to welcoming you on the ice this winter!

GLORIANA BOATHOUSE PLANS IN MARBLE HILL DROPPED
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Earlier this year, following a feasibility study which considered
    various sites in the Borough, Richmond Council opened a
    consultation on a possible site for a home for The Queen's
    Rowbarge, Gloriana, on the site of the former Orleans House
    boatyard and dock.

    Though results of the consultation have not yet been fully analysed
    it is clear a substantial majority of respondents were opposed
    to Gloriana's permanent home at this site.

    It has therefore been agreed between the Council and the Gloriana
    trustees not to proceed any further with this project. The Heritage
    Lottery Fund application has been withdrawn. No planning
    application will be presented by either party. No other site is
    being offered or considered by the Council.
