                <p>On the 9th April we <a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2006/04/st_margarets_ro_1.html">posted information</a> on the website about the a local fund raising project at <a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/directory/church/200505180349">St Margarets RC Church</a>. This is held every year in the parish during Lent and the money raised is used to help some of the poorest people on the planet. All the money raised has now been counted and accounted for and we are pleased to be able to tell you were the money has gone.</p>

                <p>Last week Thursday, 21 September, a Rapid Deployment Camera (RDC) was installed in Moormead Park, overlooking the playground.  The police requested the council a few weeks ago, but the installation was detailed due to the refitting of the new lamposts.</p>

                <h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2006/09/review_terrace.html">Review : Terrace Gardens Art Picnic</a></h3>

                <p><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/TerraceGdns.html"></a></p>


<p>In brilliant weather and under the expert advice of local artist Jill Storey, more than 30 budding artists, ranging from professional hobbyist to outright amateur, families and youngsters, turned up at the Environment Trust for Richmond&#8217;s Art Picnic in Richmond Terrace Gardens last Sunday, 24 September. Nobody, even those who&#8217;d never done anything like it before, left empty-handed or unsatisfied with what they had achieved in the course of the afternoon, and many casual visitors were impressed with the enthusiasm and range of abilities of the students and were also introduced to the work of the Trust. </p>

<p>Further regular Art Picnics are planned, and we&#8217;ll keep you posted here and on the Trust&#8217;s site at <a href="http://www.environmenttrust.co.uk/">www.environmenttrust.co.uk</a></p>

                <h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2006/09/review_brooks_b_1.html">Review : Brook&#39;s Blues Bar</a></h3>

                <p>Last night we decided to try the new Thursday evening fixture at the Turk&#8217;s Head Pub, <a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/directory/music/200608250848">Brook&#8217;s Blues Bar</a>.  On stage were <a href="http://stmgrts.org.uk/event/Concert/200608250858">Fran McGillvray and Mike Burke</a> who played two great sets of classic acoustic blues well into the night.  The atmosphere of Winchester Hall was lovely with candle lit tables, a not too loud sound system, light food and a bar.  Its has more of a club feel than a concert, so great to bring your friends.  </p>

<p>For &#163;7 its a good value and a fun night out &#8212; highly recommended.</p>

                <p>On 13th October a new consultation starts to help determine the future of the next Community Plan for 2007-2017.  <em>Your Say 2017</em> is a campaign being launched by the Local Strategic Partnership , a group of organisations whose aim is to work together to improve services within the borough, including the Police and the health services. </p>

People can go <a href="http://www.yoursay2017.org.uk/">online</a> and register from the 19th  September and then it will go live from the 13th October to 3rd November 2006.  </p>
