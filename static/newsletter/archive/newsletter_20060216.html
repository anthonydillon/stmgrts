<h3>2&#215;2 Opera Needs Your Help!</h3>

<p>We recently ran a story on the local young person&#8217;s opera company, the <a href="/archives/2006/02/2x2_opera_and_a.html">2&#215;2 Opera</a>.  Right now they are getting ready for their next performance called <a href="/cgi-bin/events.cgi?key=200602010748&amp;action=getevent">A Very Magical Flute</a> and they really need your help.  According to Deborah Meyer, </p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;We are now pretty desperate for a room/garage/workshop in which to construct our scenery.  We only need access evenings and weekends as we&#8217;re all working during the week, but would need power and light and it has be big enough to be able to assemble 10ft scenery flats.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>If you have a space for them, please email Deborah at <a href="mailto:deborah.meyer@meyermusic.co.uk">deborah.meyer@meyermusic.co.uk</a>.</p>

<h3>Councillors <span class="caps">CPZ</span> Questionnaire</h3>

<p><img alt="cpz" src="https://stmargarets.london/archives/zone-entry-thumb.jpg" width="150" height="209" align="right"/></p>

<p>Recently the current Councillors for St Margarets, have circulated a questionnaire to residents of; Bridge Road, Kenley Road, South Western Road, Brook Rood, Moormead Road, St Margarets Grove, Godstone Road, Sidney Road and Winchester Road asking their opinion as to whether they should push for a Controlled Parking Zone or <span class="caps">CPZ </span>in the area.</p>

<p>The <em>St Margarets Community Website</em> has been told that by residents of Sidney Road that many people did not receive the forms at all and asked if we could help.  To that end, we have created an <a href="/forms/cpz_form.php">online form</a> that allows residents of these streets to pass their comments directly onto the Councillors.</p>

<h3>A Star-Studded Night in St Margarets</h3>

<p>A <a href="https://stmargarets.london/cgi-bin/events.cgi?key=200602091031&amp;action=getevent">great night of music</a> is planned for Friday 10<sup>th</sup> March at the Winchester Hall, <a href="https://stmargarets.london/cgi-bin/directory.cgi?key=200505231518&amp;action=getlisting">Turks&#8217; Head</a> all in aid of a great local charity, <a href="https://stmargarets.london/cgi-bin/directory.cgi?key=200602091019&amp;action=getlisting">The Shooting Star Children&#8217;s Hospice</a>.</p>

<p>Toby Hartwell, a local resident for the last 20 years or so, is running this Year&#8217;s London marathon and aiming to raise &#163;2000 for the charity. He explains,  &#8220;At my good friend Phil Cutts&#8217;s 50<sup>th</sup> Birthday we both decided to accept the challenge of running the marathon and I was keen to put the hard work involved to a useful end by raising funds for Shooting Star. My children were both at St Stephen&#8217;s and little Orleans schools and much of the fund-raising at the school during their time there contributed to the building of the children&#8217;s hospice.&#8221; Shooting Star now needs over &#163;2,000,000 a year just to keep going and they rely purely on donations. Phil is running for the Macmillan Cancer Relief and they can be both regularly seen plodding round Richmond Park.</p>

<p>For March 10<sup>th</sup> Toby called on a number musical friends who live locally and they have all gladly given up their time for this worthy cause.  The evening promises to be a lot of fun. Tickets are &#163;5.00 on the door and their will an auction of some very desirable items including a Fender guitar and amplifier and Virgin balloon flights. The music starts at 8.00. All the money raised goes direct to the charity.</p>
