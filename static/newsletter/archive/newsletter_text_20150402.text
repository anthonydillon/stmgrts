    variety of elements including 10 new trees, perennial planting,
    granite paving creating a boardwalk with attractive seating
    overlooking the River Thames and Eel Pie Island.

    biggest war horses possible, able to carry a knight's heavy armour
    into battle - our Hampton Court shires are a fitting tribute to
    his plans.

YOGA FOR COMPLETE BEGINNERS - STARTING 19 APRIL 2015
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    In our hectic modern world many people are taking 'time out'
    to practice yoga - a system that originated in India 5,000 years
    ago. Everyone can practice yoga, regardless of age, sex or ability.

    Yoga offers us a holistic approach to body and mind, which can
    provide us with the 'tools' to cope with the challenges of daily
    life. Yoga can also complement medical science and therapy
    for specific conditions.

    You may be drawn to yoga simply for health and fitness, or be
    seeking relief for a specific physical condition. You might want
    help with managing stress. Whatever your objectives, there are yoga
    classes that can meet them.
