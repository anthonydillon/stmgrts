GIVE US YER MONEY! - IT'S HOCKTIDE!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Monday and Tuesday 12th and 13th April
    
    In times past, long before local government began shoving its 
    sticky fingers deep into our pockets, individual parishes were 
    responsible for raising the money they needed for local services.
    Some had tolls on their roads, others introduced rates and
    Brentford organised fund-raising sports days and
    public entertainments.
    
    In 1621 articles were drawn up to regulate these money-raising
    activities, one of which consisted of "convivial gatherings 
    in the church house."
    
    The article states:
    
    "The inhabitants had for many years been accustomed to have
     meetings in their church house and other places there, 
     in friendly manner, to eat and drink together, and liberally
     to spend their monies, to the end that neighbourly society
     be maintained and also a common stock raised for the repair
     of the church, maintaining of orphans, placing poor children
     in service and defraying other charges."

HOW GREEN IS MY COUNCIL?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Or, I'm only a resident get me out of here
    
    Hands up everyone who thought the Council run Arragon Road car 
    park behind Waitrose in Twickenham was for everyone?  Well it is,
    but if you're a resident you're pretty low down on the pecking
    order for finding a car parking space during the week, especially
    if you want to shop in Waitrose.
    
    I asked two of the Waitrose management team, if they were aware
    of the problem.  They certainly were. Since late last year Waitrose 
    shoppers have been complaining to them that they find it difficult
    if not impossible to find a space in the largest car park in the
    borough any time after 9-30 on a Monday to Friday.  Towards the
    end of February over a two-week period I spent several weekdays 
    visiting the car park at different terms, and sure enough the 
    number of spaces available during those visits, averaged 5 out
    of a possible 437.
    
    It seems that the car park is now monopolised by three flavours 
    of long stay parkers.  Commuters who discovered during the cold
    weather transport difficulties that it costs relatively little 
    - 8 pounds 70p to park from 7am to up until midnight - business
    users with a parking permit - and not forgetting up to around 
    150 Council staff who have permits allowing them to use the car
    park.  If the latter all choose to park there on any one day
    that takes care of around 34% of the spaces.

ST MARGARETS ROAD/A316 ROUNDABOUT TRAFFIC LIGHTS TO BE REPLACED
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Cllr Philip Morgan has been pressing the Highway Department to do
    this for many months; now, at last, it's happening. Work will 
    start on Tuesday April 6 and take 10 weeks. There will be 
    temporary traffic signals for the first two weeks of the project,
    off peak only; the current permanent signals will operate 
    from week 3 to week 10.
