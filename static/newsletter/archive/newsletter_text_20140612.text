THE D-DAY DODGERS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    "We're the D-Day Dodgers, way off in Italy
     Always on the vino, always on the spree;
     Eighth Army scroungers and their tanks,
     We live in Rome, among the Yanks.
     We are the D-Day Dodgers, way out in Italy."

    On the 6th June 1944, as units of the British 2nd Army and their
    allies stormed ashore on the beaches of Normandy, men of the
    British 8th Army, the Desert Rats, and their U.S allies were
    liberating Rome. One campaign is remembered and honoured to this
    day. The other is forgotten.

TFL CONSULTATION ON A316 ST MARGARETS CROSSING
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    The TFL are proposing to improve accessibility to crossing
    facilities at St Margaret's roundabout, Twickenham. They say:

    We propose to remove the footbridge located west of St Margaret's
    roundabout and install a new toucan crossing. This would provide an
    accessible crossing at this section of the roundabout which
    at present is not accessible to everyone.

    A toucan crossing allows both pedestrians and cyclists to cross the
    road at the same time. It is wider than other formal crossings
    which would mean that cyclists would not have to dismount when
    crossing. The toucan crossing would be staggered and have an island
    in the middle.

TWICKENHAM CHORAL SOCIETY - A HUNDRED YEARS OF HISTORY
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    After nearly a hundred years, Twickenham Choral Society is on
    the move

    Founded in 1921 as the Twickenham Musical Society, we moved to our
    current venue in Clifden Road, Twickenham, in 1922. At the time,
    the building was a high-achieving girls' school, the Twickenham
    County School for Girls (TCS). We still rehearse in its
    wood-panelled assembly hall. Many of us have spent the odd idle
    moment gazing at the gold lettering on the walls depicting the A
    level and Oxbridge achievements of former pupils of the 1940s, 50s
    and 60s, wondering where they are now and whether they too sing.

    Over the years, we have seen many changes. In the 1970s, we changed
    our name to the Twickenham Choral Society (also TCS) and a few
    years later, the school buildings became part of the Richmond Adult
    College, now the RACC. Yet the hall has remained, little changed
    since the 1960s and still sporting the emblem of the long-gone
    Middlesex County Council. Its silent lists of gold-lettered names
    have stood witness to thousands of weekly rehearsals covering a
    vast repertoire of works.

READER QUESTION - IDLING TRAINS?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hi I wondered if I was the only one in St Margarets being kept
    awake in the dead of the night by trains parking up with their
    engines running for a couple of hours whilst engineering work goes
    on ? I enquired at the station but it was a waste of time. I rang
    South West trains they knew even less. Anyone got any suggestions?

A MESSAGE FROM RICHMOND POLICE - THEFT OF PLANTS AND POTS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Just to make you all aware we have had a significant increase in
    the theft of plants, trees and shrubs from residents front gardens

    Most of these items are very heavy and would require transport
    to remove them and the majority of alleged thefts are being carried
    out overnight

    The nice weather is encouraging us all into our gardens but the
    downside is it also encourages thieves...

    Please can you be extra vigilant and also wherever possible
    property mark your pots as you would do with valuable property
    inside your house as you never know if we stop vans with plants and
    pots in them we can restore them very quickly with a postcode or
    address on them and arrest the suspect's) immediately
