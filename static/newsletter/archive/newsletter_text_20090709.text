DON'T MISS THE 31ST ANNUAL ST MARGARETS FAIR
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    This year the Fair will be on Saturday 11th July starting at 12.00
    
    There will be a full programme of  entertainment throughout the
    day, starting with a popular children's  '5-a-side' football 
    tournament in the  morning on Moormead.
    
    During the afternoon there is a dog show  on little Moormead across 
    Hillview Road.
    
    The musical entertainment will run all  afternoon on the stage, 
    and we're moving the stage further  away from the tea tent 
    to help separate the 'rock' from the rolls.
    
    There will be announcements, interviews and music throughout the 
    day from Radio West  Middlesex.
    
    The fair organisers run the Tea Tent,  Beer Tent, Pimms  Stall, 
    Greek Food, the BBQ,  the Bric-a-brac stall, a Plant  stall, 
    the Silent Auction, and the  Coconut Shy.
    
    All profits from these stalls go direct to our charities - please 
    support these stalls. Look on our plan of the fair  ground to find 
    where they are. See how we spend the money.

THE GHOST BUSTER FROM ST MARGARETS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
   In 1864 a 25 year old Cheltenham watchmaker called John Nevil
   Maskelyne was visited by an American gentleman with a piece 
   of 'apparatus' that needed attention. Its only apparent purpose was 
   to make rapping noises on the underside of tables. The stranger 
   paid well for the work and when he left he said to Maskelyne...
   
    'I'm sure a smart young fellow like you could use the 
     loose change. And in return, just forget you ever saw me.'
     
    Maskelyne, a talented conjurer who had built many of his own 
    mechanical illusions, was immediately suspicious.  Ever since 1848
    when the Fox Sisters in America claimed communication with the dead
    through table rapping and automatic writing the entire world had
    become obsessed by Spiritualism. Endorsed by establishment figures 
    like the scientist Sir William Crookes and the writer Sir Alfred 
    Conan Doyle 'psychic mediums' were appearing in droves to satisfy
    the public interest. Theatrical displays of levitation, ghosts, 
    disembodied voices and telekinesis had become commonplace - and 
    profitable too. Illusionists and conjurers like Maskelyne 
    suspected fraud.

LOCAL KUMON STUDENTS RECEIVE AWARDS FOR OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    On 25th of June 2009 at the St Margarets Catholic Church local
    students from the Kumon St Margarets Centre gained recognition 
    for their success and continued development studying on the Kumon
    maths and/or English programmes.  The committed students were 
    presented with awards at a ceremony to celebrate their achievement
    of mastering maths and English beyond their current school level.

THE MARATHON DE SABLES: EQUIPMENT
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    After much sourcing and reading about the MdS, I have finally
    found a rucksack that I can use for the race. Having worked out 
    that there are a few models that people tend to use, I spoke 
    to Mike at Likely who was brilliant. He suggested that I use a
    rucksack from aarn which fits all. The pack although complicated, 
    is great and provides me with sufficient storage space to run 
    with all the necessary equipment. It has two front pockets which
    are superb and each compartment will happily take a litre of water.
    Mike has used this type of rucksack running in the Gobi desert, 
    so it seems suitable. Unfortunately the rucksack I was using 
    previously has rubbed on my back, which is really common. I'll 
    need to rest it over the next week or so to help it heal.

CALLING ALL RUNNERS & CYCLISTS: THE LONDON DUATHLON
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Help FRODO and enter the London Duathlon this 13th September 
    in Richmond Park.
    
    Thank you to all those who have supported the St Margarets 
    for FRODO campaign, from buying the cakes and the clothes to taking
    part in the London Duathlon.  We are well on the way to raising 
    the 25,000 pounds to send a team of doctors from Gt Ormond Street
    to Romania to treat 50 plus disabled and orphaned children.  Last 
    year a team from St Margarets took part in the London Duathlon, 
    raising over 5,000 pounds.
    
    This year we want to get the largest charity team together to see
    if we can double it.  We would love anyone who can run 5k, or cycle
    to come and join us.  It is also a great day out for the family.
    
    To join or find out more please call Claire Wilson on 020 8744 0700.

ST STEPHEN'S CHURCH "HOPE 09 SOCIAL ACTION SUNDAY"
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    On Sunday, 5th July 2009, around 300 members of St Stephen's 
    Church East Twickenham spent the day volunteering as part of an 
    initiative called HOPE 09.  The initiative, which first began
    in July 2008, aims to bring "hope" to the local community 
    by undertaking practical projects for individuals in need, 
    organisations and local charities as well as carrying out random
    acts of kindness.

TAKE THE ST MARGARETS ALLIANCE SURVEY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The St Margarets Alliance is asking all residents to complete a
    survey as the first stage towards creating a Community Action Plan.
    The Survey asks residents to consider which aspects of their local
    environment, economy, or social well-being are most important
    to them and to prioritise the most important and urgent.

    Community Action Plans are central to the Sustainable Communities
    Act (SCA) of 2007, which aims to create a more local form
    of democracy.  The Plans are approved by the Secretary of State
    and funded from central government and community funds.  As such,
    Community Action Plans help communities to shape their economic,
    social and environmental well-being.

    The group is non party-political and its purpose is to coordinate a
    Community Action Plan for the area. St Margarets Alliance does not
    have a specific agenda for the St Margarets area: the results
    of the Survey will form the basis for the basis of all future
    initiatives.  The group's guiding principle is 'residents first'.
