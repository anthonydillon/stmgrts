A MAGNIFICENT YOUNG MAN IN HIS FLYING MACHINE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Saturday February 17th 1912 was a beautiful day. After the recent 
    spell of cold, damp weather people shopping in St Margarets were
    pleased to be out enjoying the bright sunshine, a clear blue sky 
    and the gentlest of breezes...
    
    It was approaching midday when they heard the sound of an 
    aeroplane approaching from the south. Aircraft were rare enough 
    in those days for them to stop and point and wonder at the marvel 
    that was passing overhead.
    
    Instead of the expected two-winged biplane appearing over the 
    rooftops, this plane was a monoplane, a Martin Handasyde, with a 
    single wing supported by bracing wires. The machine was low 
    enough for those on the ground to see the pilot sitting behind 
    the controls. Douglas Graham Gilmour had taken off at 11.00am 
    that morning from the airfield at Brooklands on a short testing 
    flight.  He told his mechanics that he would return within 
    an hour. This was not to be.

WOULD UP TO 7000 POUNDS BE USEFUL FOR YOUR FAVOURITE LOCAL CHARITY?

    500 pounds of the charity money to support other small charitable
    requests we get during the year.

    deserve some or all of the #7000, please follow this link

RICHMOND COUNCIL CONSULTATION ON CPZ AND PARKING
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Residents in Richmond upon Thames are being urged to have their 
    say on major changes to car parking policy in the borough 
    following a decision made by the Council's cabinet in July.
    
    The changes will include:
    
    - CO2 related parking taxes in community parking
      zones scrapped.
    - Clearer tariffs for meter and car parks with CO2-linked
      charging ended.
    - 30 minutes free parking for residents to help local traders.
    - A 10% reduction on meter and car park charges will also
      be available via an extended Richmond Card to borough residents.
    - Discounts will rise to 20% for those over 75, as part 
      of the Council's programme of Pensioner Preference.

    Because of the financial situation, basic charges on streets and
    in car parks will rise, but costs will be offset for residents 
    by the new parking structure.
    
    Overall, the Council's Fair Parking Policy, which also includes 
    the ending of car parking subsidies to Council staff and the
    renegotiation of the parking enforcement contract should save 
    over 1/2 million pounds even when these proposals are taken 
    into account.
