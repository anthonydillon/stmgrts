<p><em>28 April 2011</em></p>

<p>Welcome to the St Margarets Community Website Newsletter (<a href="https://stmargarets.london">stmargarets.london</a>). Occasional Thursdays we will send you the latest news and events from the website.</p>


<h2>Latest News</h2>



<!-- start include file /home/stmargarets/html/static/newsletter/news_story.incl --><br />
<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2011/04/the_ring_and_the_finger.html">The Ring and the Finger</a></h3>

<p><img src="https://stmargarets.london/assets/images/2011/ROYALWED_wedding-rings_thumb.jpg" width="150" height="112" alt="Wedding Rings by Jeff Belmonte"  align="right" style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 1px;" /></p>


<blockquote><p>At the cocktail party, one woman said to another, &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you wearing your wedding ring on the wrong finger?&#8221;</p>

<p>The other replied, &#8220;Yes I am.  I married the wrong man!&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Unless there is something going on that none of us know about I can confidently predict that when Prince William marries Kate Middleton on Friday he will at some stage in the proceedings, slip a ring onto the fourth finger of her left hand. Given eight fingers (and two thumbs) to choose from, why will he be going for this one?</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2011/04/the_queen_the_king_the_cubs_and_the_constitution.html">The Queen, The King, The Cubs and The Constitution</a></h3>

<p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3445/3733139598_701fa06892_m.jpg" width="150" alt="In Buckingham Palace garden"  align="right" style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 1px;" /></p>

<p>Of all the people watching the Royal Wedding today, the fervent monarchists with their flags and souvenir teaspoons, the republicans grumbling about the cost of the nonsense, the <em>fashionistas</em> going on about &#8216;that&#8217; dress, it is young people who will be most affected by it. With their lives stretching way ahead of them it is our children who will subjects in a country &#8216;ruled&#8217; by King William and his Queen, Catherine.</p>

<p>So what do they think about that prospect? Last night I put a simple question to a totally unrepresentative group of 8 -10 year olds, the <em>1<sup>st</sup> St Margarets Cub Pack</em>. Would they rather live in a country &#8216;ruled&#8217; by a President, like France or America or in a monarchy, like the United Kingdom? Here are the results: &ndash;</p>

<h4><span class="caps">WOULD YOU RATHER LIVE</span> IN A <span class="caps">COUNTRY RULED</span> BY:</h4>

<table><tr><td></td><td><strong>Votes</strong></td></tr><tr><td>A <span class="caps">PRESIDENT</span></td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>A <span class="caps">KING</span> OR <span class="caps">QUEEN</span></td><td>12</td></tr></table>

<p>Does this clean and precise 50/50 split mean that our monarchy is safe for the next 100 years - or does it mean that there is latent republicanism lurking in the hearts of the nation&#8217;s children - or does it mean that I should have asked a control question like, &#8220;Would you rather live in a country ruled by Wallace and Grommit&#8221;?</p>

<p>As for me, I&#8217;ll be creosoting the shed.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2011/04/council_consultation_on_sixth_form_provision.html">Council Consultation on Sixth Form Provision</a></h3>

<p>In December 2010, the Council decided to see whether it would be possible to set up viable sixth form provision in the eight secondary schools and academies within the borough (by &#8216;viable&#8217;, we mean that the provision would be sustained by sufficient student numbers to ensure that a broad and attractive curriculum could be offered).</p>

<p>As part of that work, we would like to know your views on whether or not establishing sixth forms would be a good idea, and how they would have influenced your educational choices if they had already been established.</p>

<p>Your views are important to us and will be taken into account when the resulting report is considered.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2011/04/richmond_is_number_one_for_street_parties.html">Richmond is Number One for Street Parties</a></h3>

<p>With 85 events approved, Richmond upon Thames is the hottest spot for royal wedding street parties in the capital. This follows special measures, voted through the Council&#8217;s cabinet in January, to cut red tape and make it easier for residents to hold community events to celebrate the Royal Wedding.</p>

<p>Speaking about the number of parties due to be held in the borough, Leader of Richmond Council, Lord True, said: &#8220;This is fantastic news. With just over a week to go to the big event we are now due to have 85 Royal Wedding street parties in Richmond upon Thames, the greatest number of any London borough. When you consider our population we will probably have more parties per resident than anywhere else in the country. Anything that brings communities together like this is to be welcomed.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2011/04/become_a_cycling_champion_for_sky_ride.html">Become a Cycling Champion for Sky Ride</a></h3>

<p>Enthusiastic cyclists in the borough are being invited to come forward and train to be cycle champions as part of a new Sky Ride Local programme in Richmond upon Thames.</p>

<p>Sky Ride Local are a series of small, informal cycle rides coordinated by British Cycling and Richmond Council. The group rides are led by British Cycling trained ride leaders, who guide participants along the route, and provide tips and advice on cycle safety and skills.</p>

<p>British Cycling is looking for enthusiastic residents to get involved in the local Sky Ride programme for 2011. By training as a British Cycling Ride Leader, participants will be able to inspire cyclists and receive a recognised qualification. All ride leaders will receive training on how to prepare to lead a ride, delivering and reviewing a ride, health and safety and the code of conduct.</p>

<p>The training is free and provides you with a formal qualification that can be used outside of the programme, in return for the training cyclists volunteer as a leader on a minimum of four Sky Ride Local rides in Richmond in the late summer and early autumn of 2011.</p>

<p>Approximately 30 ride leaders are required for the launch of the 2011 programme later this spring.</p>

<p>The Council&#8217;s All in One survey asked people across the borough to say what you liked about your area and what needs improving. You are invited to come along to The Civic Centre (44 York Street, Twickenham <span class="caps">TW1</span> 3BZ) on Saturday 11 June between 10 am and 4 pm to find out what people in your area said and to share your ideas and suggestions about how we can work together to make St Margarets/East Twickenham even better.</p>

<p>Music from the guitar, keyboard, flute and singing voices of Charlotte Miller and Vicki Smith filled The Marble Hill Pub, East Twickenham, along with over 70 pre-schoolers and their parents last Thursday (21 April 2011) morning.</p>

<p>It was For Sanity&#8217;s Sake&#8217;s Easter Party with Tempo Tots and the little ones were Easter bunnies, hopping to the live music and hunting out toys from behind big, cut-out, colourful eggs.</p>
