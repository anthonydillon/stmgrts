<p>Welcome to the St Margarets Community Website Newsletter (<a href="https://stmargarets.london">stmargarets.london</a>). Occasional Thursdays we will send you the latest news and events from the website.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2009/08/their_royal_highnesses_request_the_pleasure.html">Their Royal Highnesses Request the Pleasure&#8230;</a></h3>

<p><img src="https://stmargarets.london/assets/images/2009/scouts_palace-thumb.jpg" width="150" height="100" alt="1st St Margarets at Buckingham Palace" align="right" style="padding: 2px; border: 1px solid #ccc;" /></p>


<p>A <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">CUB SCOUT GUIDE</span></span></span> TO <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">BUCKINGHAM PALACE GARDEN PARTIES</span></span></span></p>

<p><em>Following their recent attendance at a Buckingham Palace Garden Party - in the presence of <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">HRH</span></span></span> The Prince of Wales and <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">HRH</span></span></span> The Duchess of Cornwall - the 1st St. Margarets Cub Scouts offer this advice, just in case you receive the official summons yourself one day&#8230;</em></p>

<h4>1. <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">TAKE ALONG</span></span></span> A <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">PACKED LUNCH AND SOMETHING</span></span></span> TO <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">DRINK</span></span></span></h4>

<p>Although you are guaranteed refreshment once you get into the garden at Buckingham Palace (let&#8217;s call it <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">B.P.</span></span></span>) there is a lot of hanging about before you actually pass through those famous gates. The Cubs, for example, first hung out in Wellington Barracks, were then moved to St James Park, returned to Wellington Barracks and then finally moved again to the inner quadrangle at <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">B.P.</span></span></span> A packed lunch helps pass time and feeds you before you get fed.</p>

<h4>2. <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">THE ROYAL </span></span></span>&#8216;WEE&#8217;</h4>

<p>The facilities in the <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">B.P. </span></span></span>gardens - or comfort stations as our American cousins like to call them - are luxurious considering that they are only temporary tented structures. They are certainly a long way removed from the grim  &#8220;Loos for Do&#8217;s&#8221; so familiar to all fans of the St. Margarets Fair - but to use them you have to be in the garden. Outside the Palace - lavvy wise - there is nothing. It is best to go before you leave home&#8230; or take your chances in the local shrubbery.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2009/08/st_margarets_community_survey_last_week_to_have_yo.html">St Margarets Community Survey - Last Week to Have Your Say</a></h3>

<p>The St Margarets Community Survey deadline has been extended to Friday 14<sup>th</sup> August.  Residents living in the St Margarets and North Twickenham voting ward, or any of the streets in the St Margarets area which received a copy of the Survey, are eligible to complete this questionnaire.  The Survey is organised by the <a href="http://www.stmargaretsalliance.com/">St Margarets Alliance</a> and enables residents to set priorities for a St Margarets Community Action Plan - funded by government and community funds and part of a nationwide strategy to create a more local form of democracy.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2009/08/appointment_of_architects_for_expansion_of_local_s.html">Appointment of Architects for Expansion of Local Schools</a></h3>

<p>The Council has announced that it is about to decide on the appointment of architects for the Orleans Infant &amp; Nursery School and St Stephens Junior School Expansions. <a href="http://www.richmond.gov.uk/view_member_decisions?mgl=mgIssueHistoryHome.asp&amp;IId=22611&amp;Opt=0">Details of the proposed decisions may be viewed here</a> and <a href="http://www.richmond.gov.uk/view_member_decisions?mgl=mgIssueHistoryHome.asp&amp;IId=22609&amp;Opt=0">here</a> These decisions will not be made before 10 August 2009. It is proposed to appoint <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">DLA</span></span></span> Architecture Ltd to do Orleans for a fee of &#163;160,000 and Reformat <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">LLP </span></span></span>to do St Stephens for a fee of &#163;450,000. The total budgets are &#163;3.1 mn and &#163;2.0 mn. The build costs are &#163;2.0 mn. and &#163;1.2 mn.</p>

<p><a href="http://cabnet.richmond.gov.uk/Published/IssueDocs/1/1/6/2/I00022611/$9Primaryschoolsexpansionconsultancycontracts.doc.pdf">Another report states</a></p>

<blockquote>
&#8216;&#8230; The design work(s) for the expansion of each school needs to commence during July 2009, if they are to be complete by July 2011 . . Completion of the building work is targeted for July in each case so as to give time for the installation of loose furniture and equipment, <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">ICT </span></span></span>and time for the schools to move into and occupy the new buildings in each case over the summer holiday period, ready for the start of the following term in September when the additional children are anticipated to need places at these schools.

<p>Should building works in each case not be complete, the education of those children due to attend the school concerned would be severely disrupted, and attract severe adverse publicity towards the council. Whilst these time scales initially appear generous, the time required to consult, design, obtain planning consent and prepare tender documents and then actually build these projects will mean that in reality these time scales will be challenging to achieve.</p>

Additionally these consultants should ideally be appointed before the school summer holidays commence, so they have had time to consult with the schools prior to head teachers and other stake holders becoming unavailable over the summer break. This will create the need for a timely decision-making process regarding the formal appointment of consultant architects, engineers and surveyors, which will likely fall outside of the usual cabinet approval timetable.&#8217;<br /><br /><br />

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2009/08/new_street_lights_on_the_warren_footpath.html">New Street Lights on the Warren Footpath</a></h3>

<p>Work will start on Tuesday 28<sup>th</sup> July starting at the Richmond Bridge end working towards Orleans Road. During the time of installation, trenching and removal work, sections of the footpath will be closed. The closures are planned to take place on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays for 10 weeks between the hours of 9 am and 5 pm. Some sections of the footpath will always remain open but you may have to divert fairly far off the river footpath to pass the closed works areas depending on the location of the works. On closure days you can divert by using the Surrey towpath between Richmond Bridge and Ham House and take Hammerton&#8217;s ferry to cross. The ferry will be free for pedestrians and cyclists on the closure days and operate from 9 am to 6 pm for the 10 weeks of works (Tuesday, Wednesdays and Thursdays).</p>

<p>All lights will have a white light fixture with no UV which are better for human face recognition as well as better for wildlife and <a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2009/03/new_batfriendly_lights_proposed_for_the_warren_foo.html">particularly for bats</a> . The cost of the project is being paid for via the Thames Landscape Strategy London&#8217;s Arcadia programme with grants from private trusts including <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">BIFFAWARD, </span></span></span>the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Father Thames Trust.</p>
