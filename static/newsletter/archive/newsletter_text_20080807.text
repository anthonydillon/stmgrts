EVENT REMINDER: LARKS IN THE PARK
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The annual festival of outdoor children's theatre, 
    Larks in the Parks, kicked off this week with an exciting 
    performance in the grounds of Orleans House Gallery.
    
    'Doctor Nose Travels Through Time' is one of 10 shows by touring 
    theatre companies that have been specially tailored for children
    aged three to 11 years.
    
    Other highlights of the action-packed programme are presentations
    about a magic wizard castle, a lost kangaroo, a mischievous toad,
    a giant six ft book, a big bad wolf and a band of crazy pirates.
    
    
    There is also the opportunity for children to get involved
    in outdoor drama workshops after some of the shows.
    
    Performances will be held in a number of venues including: Sandy
    Lane Recreation Ground, Palewell Common, Moormead Park, Broom 
    Road Recreation Ground, Mortlake Green, Kneller Gardens, Hampton
    Common and Castlenau Recreation Ground. They will run every Tuesday
    and Thursday up until the 28 August. Tickets cost 4 pounds per 
    child for each performance and all adults, carers and children
    over 14 or under the age of two are welcome to come for free.
    
    The events will also feature a campaign by the Council's Parks 
    and Open Spaces team, 'Play Cool', which will promote the need 
    for children to play safe in the sun. They will be handing out 
    free reusable water bottles, cotton hats and information about
    sun awareness.

WHO THE HECK IS HALIBURTON?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    There are some lucky people whose self-esteem is enhanced 
    by living in a road named after the famous or the good -- or both. 
    Statesmen, sports personalities, explorers and even top-secret
    World War 2 acronyms have all given their names to local streets.
    
    Us humble mortals who live in Haliburton Road, St Margarets have
    to content ourselves with the knowledge that our street is named 
    after the man who invented such well known sayings as "He drank 
    like a fish", "The early bird gets the worm" and "It's raining 
    cats and dogs".
    
    Thomas Chandler Haliburton was born in Windsor, Nova Scotia 
    in Canada on December 17th 1796, the son of a New England planter. 
    In 1821, after having the good sense to marry a girl 
    from Henley-on-Thames, he established a successful law practice
    at Annapolis Royal. By 1841 he was a Judge of the Nova Scotia 
    Supreme Court.

SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT A PENNY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    If you walk over the footbridge at Richmond Lock from the 
    St Margarets side you will see in front of you a disused kiosk. 
    Built into the front of it are the remains of an old fashioned 
    turnstile. Underneath layers of paint you can still see the words 
    "Silent Reversible Patented 1887". Up to 1938 it cost one penny 
    to use the footbridge and this is where they collected the money.
    
    The one penny toll also applied a mile or so upstream 
    at Hammerton's Ferry that links Marble Hill Park and Ham House.
    The ferry celebrated its centenary last month by offering  free 
    crossing to anyone who turned up with an old penny in their pocket.
    
    One old penny seems to have been the standing charge on ferries 
    since mythological times. That is the toll demanded by Charon who
    ferried dead souls across the Styx to Hades. Those who arrived 
    without the necessary change were obliged to wander the earth 
    forever as ghosts! Anxious to avoid such a fate the Greeks had 
    a penny stuck in their mouths before they were buried.
