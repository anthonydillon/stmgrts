ï»¿WOLF HALL PART 1 - WHEN 'THE HOLY MAID OF KENT' CAME TO SYON PARK
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    "I hold communications with saints and angels, even with
     Satan himself."

     - ELIZABETH BARTON - The Holy Maid of Kent - 1506-1534

    I would imagine that followers of "Wolf Hall" and its shadowy hero
    Thomas Cromwell will probably have had enough of Sister Elizabeth
    Barton, the so called "Holy Maid of Kent" and arch-irritant to King
    Henry 8th but just in case you are suffering from Tudor cold turkey
    and need a fix...

SARAH JANE HEMSLEY UPHOLSTERY
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    From my home workshop in St Margarets I restore, recondition and
    re-upholster antique and mid-century furniture. My aim is to create
    unique, beautifully crafted furniture from tired or worn pieces.

    Certified by the Association of Master Upholsterers my training is
    in traditional upholstery methods and hand finishes. Commissions
    begin with an obligation free visit to your home to assess your
    piece and chat about the options for restoration.

RICHMOND COUNCIL TO FREEZE COUNCIL TAX AGAIN FOR 2015/16
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Richmond Council's Deputy Leader and Cabinet Member for Finance,
    Cllr Geoffrey Samuel, is committed to delivering a sixth successive
    Council Tax freeze in 2015/16, and zero or low increases in
    future years.

    The Revenue Budget for 2015/16 was agreed by Cabinet on Thursday
    night and a final decision on the level of Council Tax will be made
    by Full Council on March 3. The Council's medium term financial
    strategy aims to deliver a Council Tax freeze whilst protecting
    existing services. The strategy has been developed in light of the
    national budget, the impact the Local Government Settlement has had
    on all local Councils, and with a review of the Council's reserves
    and balances.

ORLEANS PARK SIXTH FORMS TO OPEN
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Richmond's ambitious post-16 programme has reached another major
    milestone with the official unveiling of two sixth form centres
    at Christ's School and Orleans Park.

    Since the buildings were finished, the first intake of students
    have been enjoying the very best 21st Century facilities at the
    centres at Christ's School in Queen's Road, Richmond, and Orleans
    Park School in Richmond Road, Twickenham.
