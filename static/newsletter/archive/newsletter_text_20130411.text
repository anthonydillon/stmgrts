EVENT REMINDER: TEA WITH TURNER - 28 APRIL 2013
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Take tea in Twickenham with England's greatest landscape painter

    Celebrate J.M.W. Turner's birthday on Sunday 28 April and enjoy a
    rare opportunity to eavesdrop on conversation with his father
    about life at his Twickenham home, Sandycombe Lodge, in the early
    19th century.

    Past Pleasures, renowned for live costumed interpretation
    of historical events, presents 'Tea with Turner' for the Turner's
    House Trust. It takes place at Turner's House, 40 Sandycombe Road,
    Twickenham. There are two performances - at 2 pm and 3.45 pm. The
    event includes tea and the opportunity to enjoy this unique
    building, which Turner designed himself, 200 years ago.

    "The two actors who play Turner and his father, Chris Bailey and
    David Millinchip, have visited Sandycombe Lodge, picked up the
    vibes, and will give a cracking performance, taking us back 200
    years to imagine their 'bachelor' life in a once-rural area," said
    Catherine Parry-Wingfield, of the Turner's House Board of Trustees.
    "Turner's father, a retired Covent Garden barber who kept house
    here, is such an endearing character and dialogues between the
    famous son and the sometimes inebriated father will really make the
    house and its past come alive."

FAITH-BASED PLACES INTRODUCED AT ST STEPHEN'S PRIMARY SCHOOL
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Here is a press release from the Richmond Inclusive Schools
    Campaign against the addition of this policy. The approved
    policy follows.

    ==
    St Stephen's Primary school in St Margarets has decided to
    introduce "Foundation Places" which will give preference to
    children of worshippers at local churches, with St Stephen's church
    top of the list.

    The school's governors decided unanimously to go ahead with the
    change at their meeting on 21st March, despite objections
    from Richmond Inclusive Schools Campaign (RISC) among others.
    Councillor Scott Naylor is the Council representative on the
    governing body.

    In their objection, RISC pointed out that, until 2011/12, most
    children at St Stephen's Junior school had come from nearby Orleans
    Infants, a community school with no faith-based selection. Now both
    schools are all-through primary schools, and one of them is setting
    aside places for churchgoers.

    RISC welcomed some other changes to the admissions arrangements.
    But they expressed concern that, with parents already anxious
    about finding school places, the increased prominence of
    faith-based selection means that some parents will feel obliged
    to attend church to have an equal chance of getting their children
    into their local state primary school.

    A RISC spokesperson said: "We are disappointed that an opportunity
    is being missed to eliminate faith-based selection at St Stephen's
    altogether. We believe it's unfair for a state-funded school
    to discriminate against local children because their parents are
    not practicing Christians."

    -- from a Richmond Inclusive Schools Campaign press release

RAISING MONEY FOR WAR CHILD
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Two months ago, Louis De Schynkel's uncle, Giles Duley, returned
    to Afghanistan as a triple amputee, to document the many civilian
    casualties of war in the hospital at Kabul. Louis was particularly
    touched by the many innocent children, injured through no fault
    of their own whilst playing or walking to school. Shortly after,
    whilst watching The Brit awards he saw a short video about the
    charity War Child and knew he wanted to help.

    So on March 30th Louis, age 11, completed the challenge he had set
    himself and swam 200 lengths of Teddington Swimming pool (4000
    meters) in just over 2 hours.

    He has already raised over 800 but you can still donate and help
    him raise him more money for War Child. pounds
