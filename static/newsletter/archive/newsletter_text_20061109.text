LATEST NEWS
===========================================================



REVIEW: THE FIRST STONE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The First Stone is the first novel by a local man, Guido Casale.
    Guido has lived on the border of Old Isleworth and St Margarets 
    since 1983 and both of his daughters have passed through the St 
    Margarets schools, Orleans Infants and St Stephens.  Even though 
    the names have been changed, the book takes place entirely in and 
    around St Margarets.  All of the locations are 
    clearly recognisable.  
    
    The story itself is of two lives that become briefly intertwined
    a young girl and a criminal posing as a neighbour.  Their lives 
    have many strange parallels and they become dependant on each
    other for friendship.  The main plots are around a gold bullion
    robbery and the young girl's struggle with growing up despite some
    mental and psychological struggles.

    I highly recommend getting a copy.

    You can purchase the book at the new agents next 
    to the St Margarets Train Station.

RICHMOND COUNCIL LOOKS TO ENCOURAGE ECO-FRIENDLY CARS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Richmond Council is looking at plans to use the CPZ parking permit
    fees to encourage cars with low CO2 emissions. The current
    proposal would actually lower the cost of permits for people 
    with smaller, more efficient cars, but raise the price of a permit
    by 200% for the worst polluters.

NEW MONDAY JAZZ JAM AT THE RISING SUN
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    There is a new weekly jazz fixture on Monday nights at The Rising 
    Sun hosted by the Sam Leak Trio.  Sam says
    
        "with the Jam Session I am hoping to reach out particularly
         to the Jazzers in the Richmond and Twickenham community, 
         whose numbers have been hugely elevated due to the fantastic
         course run by Jazz Bassist Dave Jones at the Richmond Adult 
         Community College. I'd also like to attract many of the Jazz
         students around the area and London who are out there looking
         for Jam Sessions to play at and to meet up with other musicians.
         Aside from this from this I'm keen that Jazz enthusiasts (or 
         even those with only a mild interest in Jazz!) and players of
         all levels come and check it out ï¿½ whether to play or simply 
         watch some (hopefully) great jamming, and to enjoy the gig in
         the first half of each session which will be featuring some 
         great soloists each week!"

LICENSING SUB-COMMITTEE PROCEDURE QUESTIONED
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    A local resident has initiated a hearing at Richmond Magistrates' 
    Court, for it to decide whether Richmond's licensing sub-committee 
    followed the correct procedure when it recently granted a licence 
    to 'Parvinu' for the proposed wine bar below Phelps. There were 89
    written complaints from local residents, more than any other single 
    licensing issue in St Margarets - including the recent applications 
    for extension to hours from local pubs when the law changed.  At the
    onset of the meeting the Chairman announced that only 22 of these 
    complaints would be taken into consideration as he had decided 
    to set a boundary limit of 150 metres for valid objections. 
    Philip Morgan one of St Margarets local councillors (representing 
    local residents) questioned the basis for this boundary.  He was
    told it was based on a licensing application regarding a 
    Wetherspoon's pub in the Midlands.

REMEMBERING ANTHONY WILKINSON
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Sadly last week, Anthony Wilkinson died.  Anthony was a long 
    serving station manager at the St Margarets station, who retired 
    only a few years previously.  There is a condolence book 
    at the station.
