ï»¿THE LAST WOLF IN ENGLAND?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Although it is less than 7 miles from St Margarets you've probably
    never heard of Perry Oaks and you'd be hard pressed to find it on a
    map - but according to legend this medieval hamlet, now buried
    under concrete at Heathrow, is where the last wolf in England
    was killed.


    Perry Oaks and Heath Row were small hamlets on the western
    extremity of Hounslow Heath. In his 1935 book "Highwayman's Heath"
    Gordon S Maxwell wrote...

THE ST MARGARETS SUPPER CLUB
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Are you a single 38 to 48 something (give or take a few years) and
    sometimes feel you have lots of friends all over place but just no
    one local, or maybe you're so busy you don't really have many
    friends at all. Maybe you're fed up with your old friends and just
    fancy meeting some new people, either for socialising or
    networking. Either way, if you live in the St Margarets area and
    would like socialising on your doorstep, read on....Local female
    resident, is thinking about setting up a St Margarets supper club.
    It can be as fancy or as casual as you like, dinner parties
    around someone's house, bring a dish parties, order in a take away
    or simply a night out in a local restaurant.

    If you're interested email isabel@colepark.co.uk to find out more.

LOCAL CHOIR OFFERS FREE TASTER
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    If you are one of the many who have relished the particular thrill
    of communal singing at Christmas carol services and concerts
    in recent weeks, why not make it a weekly pleasure by joining
    a choir?

    Local choir 'Vocality' has just moved to St Margarets and extends a
    warm welcome to beginner and experienced singers for its new term,
    commencing this week at St Mary's Junior School.

    Vocality's unusual repertoire of harmony songs from around the
    world, combined with a fun and accessible no-sheet-music approach,
    makes rehearsals a weekly highlight for many of its members of
    all ages.

    Songs from a wide range of traditions - jazz, folk, spiritual,
    popular music and others - are selected for their uplifting
    qualities, and provide a welcome boost to the spirits on a
    winter's evening.

    Rehearsals are on Tuesdays 8.00-10.00pm at St Mary's School
    on Richmond Road. A free taster session is on offer to anyone
    wishing to try it out. Please visit www.vocalitysinging.co.uk
    for more details and to book a taster session.

MID-TERM BREAK FILM CAMPS WITH DREAMCATCHER MEDIA
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Seeing "Warhorse" hit the screens was interesting for us here
    at Dreamcatcher Media as it's not long since we walked out of our
    office at Twickenham Film Studios to see Steven Spielberg in the
    forecourt discussing the next take with his crew. Nearby, the
    majestic horses were in make-up! Yes, its true. The horses had an
    area cordoned off for make-up in the yard -- minus the usual
    dressing room mirror and bright lights of course. I watched
    as make-up artists patiently brushed their manes and around their
    hooves with toothbrushes! Having peeked through the studio doors
    to see the sets for inside the windmill and the horses stable, the
    magic of turning these sets into such realistic visuals on screen
    never ceases to amaze me. And, of course, Spielberg is a master
    at the art.

    Well it's nice to know that what's set to be a box office hit was
    made here in Twickenham. Children can pick up the filmmaking bug
    here too with Dreamcatcher Media's forthcoming mid-term break and
    summer film camps. Who knows, your child might be the Spielberg
    of the future!

    Dreamcatcher Media have been running film camps for children aged
    8-17 in Twickenham for several years now. Last year, they added two
    additional course venues in Notting Hill and Elstree. They have
    just announced their mid-term break camps for 13-17th February and
    2nd-5th April 2012, with summer courses starting early in July.
    Director David O'Keeffe says:

    "There's a magic to filmmaking that really sparks the imagination
    of our young students. They have fun coming up with their own
    unique idea for their film and it's a pleasure to help them turn it
    into something they can put up on YouTube or MySpace as their own
    piece of creative work."

PETITION TO OVERTURN PLANNING PERMISSION FOR THE TWICKENHAM STATION TOWER BLOCKS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    There is overwhelming opposition to the tower blocks over
    Twickenham Railway Station. Less than 20 comments to Richmond
    Council supported the height of the residential development and
    over 5500 opposed it. Despite the extent of public opposition,
    Richmond Council accepted the proposal.

    The Mayor of London (Boris) can overturn the decision. Over 5000
    new petitions need to be collected in the next two weeks. The only
    way that this can be achieved is if you can encourage others
    to complete the petition (partners, neighbours, family, friends,
    commuters, residents of Greater London, school parents and
    rugby fans).

    Sign the petition: http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/TRAG

    -- from Twickenham Residents' Action Group (TRAG)
