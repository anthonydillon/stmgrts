ï»¿THE ACT YOU'VE KNOWN FOR ALL THESE YEARS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    I've seen the Beatles twice and heard them once.

    The first time was in the 'Beatles Christmas Show' at the Astoria
    Cinema, Finsbury Park, early in January 1964. There were other acts
    on the bill - Billy J Kramer, the Fourmost, Tommy Quickly, Cilla
    Black and other members of Brian Epstein's 'stable' but most of us
    had only come to see the stars of the show. I say 'see' because
    that was all anyone could do. The roar of thousands of desperately
    over-excited teenage girls screaming their lungs out was
    overwhelming, impressive and totally drowning any music that the
    four boys on stage might have played.

PLEASE SUPPORT DEBRA'S ENGERGY HEALING EVENT - 11 MAY 2013
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Espirit 4 Health invites you to join us on an Energy Healing event
    on Saturday, 11th May 2013 to raise funds for DEBRA.

    DEBRA is the national charity working on behalf of people in the UK
    with the genetic skin blistering condition Epidermolysis
    Bullosa (EB).

    Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) is a very rare genetic condition in
    which the skin and internal body linings blister at the slightest
    knock or rub, causing painful, open wounds.

    EB is likely to affect 1 in 17,000 live births and it is estimated
    that there are currently 5,000 people with the condition in the UK.
    Because EB is an inherited condition (it cannot be caught), which
    is passed on genetically from parents to children, first time
    parents often do not know that they are carriers and will have no
    prior warning that the child will be affected, until birth.

NEW SPRING 2013 YOGA-FITNESS CLASSES
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Put a spring in your step with Yoga-Fitness

    Gwyneth does it. Madonna does it. Marilyn Monroe used to do it way
    before it became a popular practice. Even people with back pain do
    it. But why? What are the benefits?

    Improved body tone, strength, flexibility, posture and energy are
    just some of the reasons to start practicing, as well as an
    opportunity to rejuvenate and relax. All reason enough to get on
    the mat and start practising.
