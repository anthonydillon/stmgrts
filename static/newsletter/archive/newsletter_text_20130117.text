THE MONASTERY OF SION - PART 2 - AT THE END
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    In 1432, 18 years after its original foundation on meadows close
    to where Richmond Lock now stands, the monastery of Sion and its
    establishment of 60 nuns and 25 brothers, moved to a larger
    building recently constructed in what is now Syon Park. For all the
    extra room and facilities, life didn't get any easier for these
    'Disciples of Christ' who followed a strict programme of observance
    and worship...

EVENT REMINDER: SECOND TWICKENHAM HYPERLOCAL MEET UP - 24 JANUARY 2013
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The following is an invite from the very excellent Twickerati
    website. We went to last year's event and had a great time, so we
    will be heading over this year as well. If you fancy a pint and a
    chat about all things local, come along and say 'hello'.


    Hey, how you doin'? Or rather, hey, what you doin'? And to be a
    little more specific, what are you doing on the evening of Thursday
    24th of January? Twelve months after the first Twickerati
    Hyperlocal Twickenham Meet Up (aka 'Twickenham tweet up') it's only
    bloody time for another one, isn't it? Yes, yes it is.

    What's the point?

    If you read local websites or blogs, if you run a local website or
    blog, or if you want to get involved in some way then it's a chance
    to meet with some random strangers who are into the same thing. Or,
    if you've got ideas about Twickenham that can't be adequately
    addressed by another El Brute online consultation or through the
    medium of writing furious letters to the Richmond and Twickenham
    Times then it could be for you. Or if you just want to chat
    about Twickenham or social media stuff over a drink then come
    on down. We don't go in for 'networking' here at twickerati but if
    we did, it would be a bit like this only better.

    Who's going to be there?

    Tricky one that. Your humble correspondent is top of the list,
    which is probably just as well. And last year there were the
    founders of TeddingtonTown, St Margarets, Guide2Richmond, For
    Sanity's Sake plus a varied but very friendly assortment of locals
    with a general interest in Twickenham stuff. If you've read this
    far, you'd fit right in (in a good way, of course).

    When and where?

    Thursday 24th January from 8.30pm at the new bar, Ales and Tails
    at 31 York Street, Twickenham.

    What else do I need to do?

    Nothing, other than prepare a 15 minute Powerpoint presentation
    of your vision for Twickenham over the next decade. Actually, scrap
    that, just bring yourself.

    So, who's in?

    -- from Twickerati

RIVER CRANE POLLUTION - FISH RESTOCKING - DECEMBER 2012
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    In late October last year the River Crane and the Duke
    of Northumberland's River were both devastated by the uncontrolled
    discharge of an enormous volume of raw sewage. The incident
    occurred due to the blockage of a large Thames Water sewer main and
    the subsequent release of effluent into the river rather
    than allowing it to flood Heathrow Airport.

    Over the last year the Friends of the River Crane Environment
    (FORCE) have been reviewing what has happened in response to this
    disaster and how the river is coping. We know that, immediately
    following the pollution event, the river was essentially dead, all
    the fish and river insect life being killed along the 20 kilometres
    of the River Crane and Duke of Northumberland's River between the
    outfall (next to the A4 in Cranford) and the River Thames.

    Around 7,000 mature fish, including seventeen different species,
    were bagged up and sent to Mogden to be counted and we estimate
    that upwards of 10,000 fish were killed in total.
