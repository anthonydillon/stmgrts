ï»¿NEW JUBILEE POND IN RICHMOND PARK TO BE CREATED
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Sir David Attenborough launches Richmond Park Ponds and Streams
    conservation appeal.

    The Queen's visit to Richmond Park on May 15 will see a new Jubilee
    Pond being created in her honour and to commemorate her
    Diamond Jubilee.

    Sir David Attenborough, Patron of the local charity the Friends
    of Richmond Park, will dig the first spade of earth and hand
    over the pond to The Royal Parks (which manages Richmond Park)
    for completion.

    Located on the road from Sheen Cross to the Royal Ballet School,
    the pond is next to the area of the community celebrations which
    The Queen will visit during the Wild London Jubilee event, which
    will be held on Richmond Park's sports fields on May 15.

    The aim of the new pond is to create a freshwater habitat for a
    range of species including invertebrates, amphibians, birds and
    bats. It also aims to retain water in the Park, to help
    to counteract the effects of climate change.

EVENT REMINDER: QUEEN'S DIAMOND JUBILEE RICHMOND PARK - 15 MAY 2012
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    In Her Majesty's first official visit to the borough in 23 years,
    The Queen will attend the specially commissioned community festival
    'Wild London' in Richmond Park on 15 May 2012. Richmond Council and
    The Royal Parks have teamed up to host this special event which
    will pay tribute to The Queen's six decades on the throne and
    celebrate both London's natural environment and the important role
    that the borough's parks and gardens play in bringing people closer
    to nature.

    The event is made up of three main zones - the Recreation zone, the
    Conservation zone and the Inspiration zone. Each zone will have
    stalls from a variety of organisations who will be providing
    interactive activities, demonstrations and performances. These
    organisations represent the wide range of culture, sport and nature
    that the borough has to offer to visitors and residents. Find out
    more about who is attending and how to get to the event.

    The public festival will be held on the sports pitches between the
    Sheen Gate and the Roehampton Gate, starting at 11.00am. For those
    wanting to get a glimpse of The Queen on her drive into the park,
    she will be arriving at Richmond Park's Sheen Gate in the early
    afternoon. Exact timings will be announced the day before the
    visit.

ORLEANS GALLERY EXHIBITION- RICHMOND'S ROYAL CONNECTIONS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    To mark the Queen's Diamond Jubilee, The Leader of the Council,
    Lord True, opened an exhibition showcasing the Borough's royal
    history, at Orleans House Gallery in Twickenham.

    The Royal Connections exhibition is a culmination of a 40,000
    pounds project funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund exploring over 500
    years of Richmond's Royal past. On display are works from the
    Borough's art collection, as well as external loans from the
    prestigious Phillip Mould Gallery and National Portrait Gallery.
    
    Over 100 people from the local community helped curate the exhibit
    which plans to tell the story of Borough's intimate  royal connections.

    After 10 successful years running her Crown Rd Pilates studio,
    owner Sarah Duley is pleased to announce the opening of 117, an
    additional studio in St Margarets, Twickenham.

    Sarah and her team of experienced teachers will be offering more
    classes and more choices, adding Gyrotonic, Gyrokinesis, Yoga and
    Family Friendly Fridays, to the already well-established Pilates

PLANNING: LIDL SUPERMARKET AND TRAVELODGE IN EAST TWICKENHAM
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Residents of East Twickenham and St Margarets should be aware that
    a major planning application has been submitted to Richmond Council
    to redevelop the existing office block and car park on the main
    Richmond Road Road, behind the bus stop (and beside Old Ryde House)
    into a Lidl supermarket and a 92 bedroomed Travelodge hotel. This
    development is much bigger and a storey higher than the existing
    one, has very limited onsite parking and would increase traffic and
    parking pressures in the area.

    More Information
    
    - The reference number is 12/1001/FUL and the consultation
       will close on the 16 May 2012.

RICHMOND PARK - STARFISH DECOY SF8A  - THE FIRES BURN ON!
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Following on last week's article about Starfish Decoy SF8A - the
    "fake" town built in Richmond Park during WW2 to attract Luftwaffe
    bombers away from London - I have located some interesting
    photographs taken at the time.

    The first, taken on 22nd April 1944, is an aerial photograph
    of SF8A, the decoy in Richmond Park. The photograph is aligned
    with north to the top of the picture. On the left hand side of the
    photograph, just out of shot, is the Star and Garter Home, and
    in the top left hand corner is Sheen Gate and the adjacent
    cemetery.

MORE BREAKING NEWS FORM THE ST MARGARETS TRADERS ASSOCIATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    It is with great regret we announce that the famous St Margarets
    Diamond has gone missing!

    The story so far...

    The famous and very valuable St Margarets Diamond was recently
    re-discovered in St Margarets after being lost for centuries. The
    diamond went on display for all to admire but unfortunately has
    gone missing again!

    International diamond thief - Dia Monte has been seen in the area
    and Inspector Bright-Spark of the Yard has deduced that Dia Monte
    has stolen the diamond and hidden it somewhere in St Margarets. How
    does Inspector Bright Spark know this? Because a shopping list
    belonging to Dia Monte was found near to where the diamond
    was stolen.

    Can you help Inspector Bright-Spark solve the clues and recover the
    diamond? Our friends at Churchills Estate Agents are offering a
    reward prize of a family break to a fun packed theme park to the
    lucky junior detective who solves the mystery. Clue sheets and
    entry forms are available from Churchills offices in St
    Margarets Road.
