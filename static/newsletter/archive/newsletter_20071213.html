<p><em>13 December 2007</em></p>

<p>Welcome to the St Margarets Community Website Newsletter (<a href="https://stmargarets.london">stmargarets.london</a>). Each Thursday we will send you the latest news and events from the website.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2007/12/st_margarets_fair_christmas_dinner.html">St Margarets Fair Christmas Dinner</a></h3>

<p><img src="https://stmargarets.london/assets/images/2007/xmas_fair_dinner2-thumb.jpg" width="150" height="112" alt="The Christmas pudding is on its way..." align="right" style="padding: 2px; border: 1px solid #ccc" /></p>

<p>Around a hundred of St Margarets more senior citizens had an early Christmas meal courtesy of the St Margarets Fair and everyone who supported this year&#8217;s event. The venue was the Winchester Hall and the food was prepared by the Turks Head catering staff. During the meal last Wednesday evening 5th December, cheques were presented to three of the charity beneficiaries of this year&#8217;s Fair. Collecting the cheques were Richard Robinson, Chairman of the River Thames Boat Project, Diarmaid O&#8217;Sullivan the branch manager of South West London Alzheimer&#8217;s Society, and Claire Chapman the manager of Marble Hill Playcentres. Saturday the July 12th is the date of next year&#8217;s 30th anniversary Fair, which as always will be on Moormead recreation ground.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2007/12/alls_well_at_the_mary_wallace_theatre_for_14_18_ye.html">All&#39;s Well at the Mary Wallace Theatre for 14 - 18 year olds!</a></h3>

<p>In 1991 the Richmond Shakespeare Society opened its doors to a younger generation and started its first Youth Theatre group. 16 years later one of the original members is back to return the favour! Karin Abbott followed in the footsteps of her father, Francis, by treading the boards at the Mary Wallace Theatre from an early age. Having watched her step-mother Katie and younger brother George continue on the tradition of the RSS Youth Theatre she felt it was time to give something back.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2007/12/cllr_morgan_comments_on_the_cpz.html">Cllr Morgan Comments on the CPZ</a></h3>

<p>It was made clear to us at the local elections that a main issue for St  Margarets was the quantity of vehicles and the difficulty of parking them in some roads, especially at night. Though it seemed unlikely that residents wanted parking controls after working hours, a controlled parking zone [CPZ] could ease the position during the day for some residents in some roads by excluding commuter parking. Richmond uses a two-stage consultation process to decide whether or not to implement a CPZ ( <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2sflgr">See this article</a> ). Stage 1, which finds out who are these residents and which are the roads, was done in May/June; the results were published at <a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2007/07/cpz_results_published.html">on this site here</a> and <a href="http://www.richmond.gov.uk/st_margarets_parking_study.pdf">here, on the Council&#8217;s site</a> .</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2007/12/notes_on_cpz.html">Notes on CPZ</a></h3>

<p>The <a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2007/12/cpz_update.html">editorial by Kim Thomas</a> has resulted in a number of questions and comments about the CPZ that I felt warranted a brief note for clarification and balance.</p>


<ol>
<li>Many people had questions about the original consultation&#8217;s results.  This site published an <a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2007/07/cpz_results_published.html">article with links to the Richmond Council documents and many nice charts and maps</a></li>
<li>The current (second) consultation phase that we are now in was based on a Council decision published not long after the initial consultation results, on 18 July 2007.  This site&#8217;s article, <a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2007/07/expanded_cpz_moves_to_next_stage.html">Expanded CPZ Moves to Next Stage</a> describes the next steps and rough timetable for the secondary stage of the CPZ planning &#8212; which the Council has largely kept up with.  These include the following three points which suggest what is happening now shouldn&#8217;t be too surprising:
<ul>
<li>To progress a CPZ to the next stage of consultation in those roads south of Netherton Road and west of Cassillis Road, (including Southwestern Road and St Margarets Grove in the consultation but not necessarily in the implementation), to include the setting up of a parking working group of resident and business representatives to progress detailed design and advertise a traffic regulation order.</li>
<li>To agree for statutory consultation to take place prior to a decision being taken on those roads to be included within a zone.</li>
<li>To carry out a review six months after implementation, should a zone be introduced, and the review to include those areas adjacent to the zone.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you look at the streets currently under consideration, the voting there was closer to 48% in support of the CPZ, it was 65% against if you looked at the entire area in the initial survey.</li>
<li>Prior to receiving Kim&#8217;s editorial this site had asked our local councillors, including Cllr Trigg for more information on the status of the CPZ and received only the most basic information and are still waiting for a more detailed and formal set of information to publish an article.</li>
</ol>
