EVENT REMINDER: THE REAL THOMAS CROMWELL - 20 OCTOBER 2014
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    A talk on 20 October 2014 at 7pm is followed by a sparkling
    wine reception

    Born in Putney a lowly tavern keeper's son, and having lived for a
    time in Mortlake, Cromwell rose swiftly through the ranks to become
    the king's right-hand man and one of the most powerful figures
    in Tudor history.

    The architect of England's break with the Roman Catholic Church and
    the dissolution of the monasteries, he was reviled for years as a
    Machiavellian schemer who stopped at nothing in his quest for
    power. But Thomas Cromwell was also a loving husband, father and
    guardian, a witty and generous host, and a loyal and devoted
    servant. With new insights into Cromwell's character, his family
    life and his close relationships with both Cardinal Wolsey and
    Henry VIII, Tracy Borman examines the life, loves and legacy of the
    man who changed the shape of England forever.

EVENT REMINDER: SERIOUSLY SPOOKY HALLOWEEN ACTIVITIES AT STRAWBERRY HILL
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Horace Walpole's castle in Twickenham, Middlesex will be the scene
    for a week of seriously spooky Halloween activities for children
    and adults from 25 October to 31 October 2014.

    The villa is the perfect setting for a week of Halloween activities
    with its Gothic revival architecture and history and the exciting
    programme is supported by Twickenham based, Milestone and Collis.

    Mysterious and spooky workshops will be held for children including
    last year's sell-out Confusing Concoctions Workshop on 29 and 31
    October from 1pm. Colourful liquids and a spell book will be just
    two of the tools on hand to help the children create their own
    magic potion and befuddle their friends.
