JULY 27TH - REMEMBER THE FLOWER! REMEMBER THE CITY!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    July 27th is a largely forgotten anniversary but on that date we
    are invited to remember an insignificant flower and the city that
    it has come to symbolise.

      There's a little city flower every spring unfailing
      Growing in the crevices by some London railing,
      Though it has a Latin name, in town and countryside
      We in England call it London Pride.

    In the late spring of 1941, at the height of the wartime Blitz,
    Noel Coward was sitting on the platform of a bombed out London
    railway station watching people as they went to work. Despite
    the damage all around them, the fires, the smell of smoke and
    exposed sewers, despite the fact that many of them had spent
    sleepless nights in cramped air raid shelters, despite their
    exhaustion and their anxiety the people of London were picking
    their way through the rubble as if nothing had happened. London
    may have been down but it certainly wasn't out and ordinary
    Londoners were proving it by 'keeping calm and carrying on'.

IN THE NEWS: MOTHER BARRED FROM SCHOOL FOR CONFRONTING SON'S BULLY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Miss Hart said she felt compelled to protect her son when the
    teachers at Orleans Infants School in Twickenham failed to do so.
    "I am being punished because I stood up for my son when the school
    appeared to be doing nothing about my complaints," she said. The
    school said pupil safety was paramount and all bullying procedures
    had been followed.
