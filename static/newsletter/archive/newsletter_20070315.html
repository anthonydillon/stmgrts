<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2007/03/local_hatha_yog.html">Local Hatha Yoga Classes with Helen</a></h3>

<p><a href="https://stmargarets.london/yoga.html"></a></p>

<p>Hatha yoga is 5,000 years old. It is non-competitive and it teaches us self-discipline and self-awareness.</p>

<p>Yoga helps to:</p>


<ul>
<li>Support the body&#8217;s systems (endocrine, immune, respiratory, circulatory etc)</li>
<li>Strengthen and lengthen muscles</li>
<li>Improve posture</li>

<li>Focus the mind in the present, offering a relief from every day stresses and strains</li>
</ul>



<p>About Hatha Yoga</p>

<p>I teach <a href="https://stmargarets.london/directory/health_aNd_beauty/200703081619">hatha yoga</a>. My classes include preparatory movements, postures (asanas), breathing techniques (including pranayama) and relaxation. I vary my classes each week.</p>

<p>I focus on alignment and breathing, in order to help release tension in the mind and body and to help student&#8217;s develop greater body intelligence. I put emphasis on the connection between body and breath, rather than advanced posture work and speed.</p>

<p>Classes</p>


<p>There are two classes, Monday for all levels and Thursday mornings for beginners.  Please bring your own yoga mat. Or contact Helen to ordered a discounted mat.  Classes are held at Winchester Hall, next to the Turk&#8217;s Head Pub on Winchester Road.</p>
