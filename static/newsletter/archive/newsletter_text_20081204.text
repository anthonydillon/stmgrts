THE TWICE TOLD TALE OF THE TITANIC
----------------------------------------------------------------------
      "Any coincidence", said Miss Marple to herself, 
      "is always work noting. You can throw it away later
      if it is only a coincidence."
      
        - Agatha Christie
        
      Anyone who has wandered down Ducks Walk in recent times will 
      have seen the blue plaque commemorating the life of Charles 
      Herbert Lightoller who once lived there. Lightoller was born 
      in 1874 and went to sea when he was only 13. In 1912, after many
      adventures at sea, he was appointed Second Officer aboard the 
      'Titanic', the White Star Line's new and 'virtually unsinkable'
      ship on its ill-fated maiden voyage from Southampton 
      to New York.
      
      Lightoller's heroism on the night of 14 April 1912, when the 
      'Titanic' ran into an iceberg and sank, has often been told
      in books and films. After organising passengers into lifeboats
      Lightoller personally saved over 30 survivors by diving into the 
      freezing water and encouraging them to cling to an upturned boat.
      They were all eventually rescued by the 'Carpathia'. Second 
      Officer Lightoller was the last survivor to be pulled 
      from the water.
      
      What is less well known is this familiar story of a huge 
      'unsinkable' ship hitting an iceberg in mid Atlantic and sinking 
      had been told 14 years earlier in almost identical detail 
      in a popular novella. This time the ship was not the 'Titanic'
      but the 'Titan'!  How's that for similarity?

PLEASE VOTE FOR CRANE VALLEY PARK
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Mayor of London has recently announced the final 
    of a competition which will result in ten London parks winning 
    L400,000 each. One of the 47 finalists is Crane Valley Park a 
    project which the Friends of the River Crane Environment (FORCE) 
    have been promoting, together with the London Borough of Richmond
    upon Thames , the London Borough of Hounslow and London 
    Wildlife Trust.
    
    If we were to win, this funding would enable a new park 
    to be created, doubling the length of the existing Crane Park, 
    and providing a continuous managed green valley park linking
    Twickenham Station in the east with Hounslow Heath in the west.
    Crane Valley Park would give local people of all ages somewhere 
    to walk and cycle, to enjoy nature and the fresh air.
