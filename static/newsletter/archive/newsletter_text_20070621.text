CPZ POLL THOUGHTS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    To date, with 160 people voting in our informal CPZ poll, ~57% 
    of you have said 'NO' to a CPZ in the Moormead and north of the 
    A316 area (only ~37% said 'YES').  We also know of two non-web 
    groups walking various streets collecting names of people who are
    against the CPZ, which we have not seen since the last
    Council elections.
    
    While some might have predicted this, we did not.  We assumed 
    that most people  would be for anything that might relieve some 
    of the parking pressure (right or wrong).  It will be interesting 
    to see what the actual survey results are.
    
    Where you surprised?

MORE ON ST MARY'S ASTROTURF
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    There have been several new comments worth reading on St Mary's
    Astroturf Planning Problems.  For example, this from a long note
    and email chain posted by Peter Hunt:

       "I have just read [Cllr] Trigg's letter to this forum.
        I cannot believe that people so obsessed with process
        over common sense can manage to get elected.  I hope
        that any parents resident in his ward will take the
        opportunity to let him know directly that they do not
        consider his behaviour as supporting their needs
        as voters."
