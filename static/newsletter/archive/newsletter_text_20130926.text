THE RISE AND FALL AND RISE AGAIN OF THE COFFEE HOUSES
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Following on the recent debate about Harris and Hoole:-
  
    a) Do we actually want/need another coffee shop?
    b) Should it be allowed to sell alcohol between 11.00am and
       10.00pm?...

    ...I decided to step out and count the number of coffee outlets we
    have in St Margarets. I started my census at the little "Expresso"
    kiosk down by the roundabout - "one" - but by the time I reached
    the coffee shop on St Margarets Station - "five" - and faced
    with the prospect of at least seven more to come I gave up... so
    much coffee, so little time.

SIMON CHAPMAN WINS A RICHMOND COMMUNITY AWARDS 2013
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Twenty-eight residents from around the borough were honoured on the
    21 September 2013 at an event to celebrate Richmond Council's
    Community Awards.

    Over the four week nomination period nearly 150 nominations were
    received. An officer panel chaired by the Cabinet Member
    for Communities, Business and Culture, reviewed each nomination and
    selected a final 28 to be presented with an award.

    The winners were nominated for a wide range of activities, ranging
    from those who have established and managed community groups, those
    who organise community events, residents who have volunteered or
    raise money for charity and those who help support the most
    vulnerable in society.

    Simon won as he has dedicated enormous time and effort to the
    development of St Margaret's as a thriving business community.

    Well done and thank you Simon
