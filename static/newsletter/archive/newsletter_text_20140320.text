LATEST NEWS
===========================================================



ï»¿"BLOODY BELGIANS" IN ST MARGARETS IN THE FIRST WORLD WAR
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Building Pelabon Workshop No. 4: the building which later became
    Richmond Ice Rink. 1914-15

    News about the First World War Belgian refugees across the border
    in East Twickenham has now hit the headlines, but the story of the
    refugees in St Margarets is still to be told. If East Twickenham
    was the hub of the Belgian community, then St Margarets and
    adjacent parts of Central Twickenham were its perimeter.

    If you don't yet know the background, East Twickenham became the
    centre of a community of 6000 First World War Belgians after a huge
    Munitions Works was set up by Monsieur Charles Pelabon. This
    started in a disused roller-skating rink in Cambridge Road and then
    expanded to cover the whole of the area which is now the Richmond
    Bridge development. Another of Pelabon's buildings later became the
    famous Richmond Ice Rink, which was demolished to make way for
    these luxury flats.

CLAUDE DUVAL - DANCING IN THE MOONLIGHT
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Regular readers of this website already know that our little corner
    of Paradise sits on the southern edge of what was the most
    dangerous 4,000 acres of open countryside in the entire kingdom. In
    its time Hounslow Heath was the favoured haunt of footpads, robbers
    and highwaymen and the most handsome, the most charming, the most
    dashing of them all was the roguish Claude Duval. Huzzah!

    There is a well established stereotype of the highwayman -
    handsome, debonair, aristocratic and fearless. You know the type.
    Valencienne lace at his throat, a well balanced pistol in his hand
    and a buxom lady swooning in his arms. If you're thinking James
    Mason, you've got it.
