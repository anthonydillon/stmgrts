<p>Welcome to the St Margarets Community Website Newsletter (<a href="https://stmargarets.london">stmargarets.london</a>). Occasional Thursdays we will send you the latest news and events from the website.</p>


<h2>Latest News</h2>



<!-- start include file /home/stmargarets/html/static/newsletter/news_story.incl --><br />
<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2009/09/news_from_the_st_margarets_traders_association.html">News from the St Margarets Traders Association</a></h3>

<p>The traders association with support from Richmond council has been actively seeking to encourage and support new businesses to the area. We are very please to become on of the few local areas that does not have any empty shops on the market. The last few remaining empty units in Crown Road and St Margarets Road are all &#8216;work in progress&#8217; and very soon should all have re opened. We thought you might like a summary of some of the changes taking place:</p>


<ul>
<li>Mrs Moon haberdashery will be opening at the empty shop at 41 Crown Road</li>
<li>Gaia is moving into the empty shop at 8 Crown road (whilst their premises is being re-built).</li>
<li>The former &#8216;Nosh&#8217; restaurant is currently being refurbished and will reopen later in the year under new ownership.</li>

<li>The car showroom at 49 Crown Road has re-opened under new management</li>
<li>The empty unit at 91 Crown Road is under offer - watch this space.</li>
<li>The former &#8216;Fiori&#8217; site at the station is due to be refurbished - the owners say they also have a tenant in place for the New Year.</li>
</ul>


<p>The Traders Association will be also launching the St Margarets magazine in November. The magazine will include news and information about all the latest ranges of offer in St Margarets along with recommendations for your festive table.</p>

<p>We would also like to include some local stories, recommendations, pictures and illustrations. If you would like to submit an article or favourite picture for inclusion in the magazine please contact the editor at <a href="mailto:%65%76%65%6E%74%73%40%73%74%6D%67%72%74%73%2E%6F%72%67%2E%75%6B">events@stmgrts.org.uk</a></p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2009/09/turings_poisoned_apple_a_footnote.html">Turing&#39;s Poisoned Apple - A Footnote</a></h3>

<p><img src="https://stmargarets.london/assets/images/2009/turing_chair-thumb.png" width="140" height="150" alt="Alan Turing in a chair"  align="right" style="padding: 2px; border: 1px solid #ccc;" /></p>


<p>On 21<sup>st</sup> May this year this website published <a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2009/05/turings_poisoned_apple.html">an article about Alan Turing</a>, the mathematical genius and code breaker who helped shorten the Second World War by unravelling the German&#8217;s Enigma Code. Despite his inspired, patriotic work, in 1952 Turing was charged with gross indecency as a homosexual and underwent &#8220;chemical castration&#8221; &#8212; the injection of the oestrogen hormone - for his so called &#8216;crimes&#8217;. He also lost his security clearance, meaning he could no longer work for GCHQ, the post-war successor to Bletchley Park.</p>

<p>Readers of this article will be pleased to learn that on Friday 11th September 2009 the Prime Minister Gordon Brown issued an unequivocal apology to Alan Turing, describing his treatment at the hands of the justice system as &#8220;inhumane&#8221;, &#8220;horrifying&#8221; and &#8220;utterly unfair&#8221;.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Without his outstanding contribution the history of world war two could well have been very different&#8221;, he said.</p></blockquote>

<p>This belated apology will be welcomed by all those gay men and women who have suffered as a result of homophobic laws and homophobic attitudes. It will make no difference however to Alan Turning.  On the morning of 8 June 1954, dishonoured and defiled, he committed suicide by eating an apple laced with cyanide, He was 41 years old.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2009/09/event_reminder_riverniscence.html">Event Reminder: Riverniscence</a></h3>

<p><img src="https://stmargarets.london/images/events/rivernicence_thumb.png" width="150" height="106" alt="River-nicence poster" align="right" style="padding: 2px; border: 1px solid #ccc;" /></p>

<p>Between the Locks is a two-year oral history project to record the lives of people making their living from the river and the heritage of the Thames river community, bounded by the locks at Richmond and Teddington, centred on Twickenham and Eel Pie Island. The project is being run by the Environment Trust for Richmond Upon Thames, supported by funds from the Heritage Lottery Fund and Hampton Fuel Allotment Charity.</p>

<p>The project brings together school students from Christ&#8217;s with elders of the river community. As well as recording the elders&#8217; voices, the students are carrying out some of the practical activities of boatbuilding, lock-keeping, riverbank management and other skills. Sound and video recordings of the project will be made available to schools, libraries and community centres via DVD and the internet and a travelling exhibition, designed with the help of the students, will ensure that the stories are shared with the local community.</p>
