ST MARGARETS FAIR 2006 A BIG SUCCESS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Brilliant weather saw record crowds at this year's July 15th Fair 
    on Moormead.  Once again it looks like the Fair has exceeded the 
    previous year's record profits — all of which go to local schools 
    and designated charities.  This year Moormead itself is also set
    to benefit, with some of the money going towards the proposed 
    cricket pavilion refurbishment. The Council will match 
    {L-} for {L-} any donation made by the Fair for this project. 
    A more detailed report in September when the final figures 
    are available.   The Fair Committee will be having an open 
    meeting in Winchester Hall on Monday the 18th of September at
    8pm for anyone interested in helping out next year.
