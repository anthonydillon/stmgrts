CPZ CONSULTATION IN ST MARGARETS DELAYED
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The consultation for the proposed Controlled Parking Zone [CPZ] 
    in St Margarets village will not start until late January at the
    earliest. The Council's Cabinet plans to decide at its meeting 
    on Monday, 15 January 2007, on the details of its new charging 
    scheme for CPZs, which is currently out to consultation (see 
    Consultation on emission based charging for parking permits and
    note the deadline for receipt of completed questionnaires and
    comments is 15 December 2006.)
    
    If all runs to plan, the consultation will start as soon as is 
    feasible after January 15 and will contain full details of the 
    charges that will apply if a CPZ is created. A legal challenge 
    to the new scheme (unlikely but possible) will delay 
    matters further.

ART DECO LONDON - LOCAL BOOK, LOCAL BARGAIN
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Art Deco London  written by local resident Colin Hines 
    with photographs by Paul Riddle and Keith Cheetham is the first 
    ever guide book to the 20's and 30's deco delights of the capital. 
    Its 60 pages contain 110 superb colour photographs and shows where 
    in London magnificent examples of art deco can be found, eaten and
    quaffed in, slept in, shopped in, and campaigned for. Its deco 
    delights range from 'palaces of the people' cinemas (many saved
    thanks to bingo), theatres, hotels, homes, shops, museums, a deco
    hospital and even a 'decover and out' crematorium.
    
    Local deco delights include Twickenham Bridge, Mortlake 
    Crematorium and the authors own 'Miami in Middlesex' 30's home.
    
    The book would make an excellent Christmas present for anyone 
    interested in architechture - think mini-coffee table book.

LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD FOR SUNVIL'S NOEL JOSEPHIDES
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Noel Josephides, the co-founder of Sunvil Holidays, based in Old 
    Isleworth, Middlesex, has been awarded the British Guild of Travel
    Writers' highest honour, the 2006 Lifetime Achievement Award in
    recognition of his contribution to the world of travel, which 
    includes his pioneering campaign for 'green' tourism long before
    the concept was adopted by other sectors of the travel industry.
    
    Cyprus-born Josephides co-founded Sunvil Holidays, a small tour 
    operation to Cyprus, in 1973. The company was badly affected by 
    the Turkish invasion of 1974, but survived, expanded and now 
    produces ten brochures a year to a range of destinations 
    worldwide. Based in Isleworth, Middlesex, Sunvil has always 
    stayed true to its original mission to provide responsible, 
    low-volume, low-impact tourism to areas off the beaten track.
    When Josephides first started campaigning for 'green' tourism 
    in the early 1980s, the idea was both new and controversial.

EVENT REMINDER: CHRISTMAS SHOOTING STAR NIGHT
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    December will be ushered in with a special Shooting Start Winter 
    Party at the Turks Head on Friday 1st December in aid 
    of The Shooting Star Children's Hospice. This will definitely 
    put everyone in the mood for a festive Christmas period before 
    getting bogged down with all that Christmas shopping.
    
    With four terrific local Twickenham bands playing a wide range 
    of music, from Motown to Glamrock, it promises to be a 
    fun-filled evening. The headline act is  "The Shooting Ska 
    Allstars" playing their highly infectious blend of Reggae
    and Ska music.  "The Funk Bomb Detonators" kick off the evening
    with 60's Soul and Motown numbers and St Margarets' very own 
    "Doghouse"  will be playing a great selection of hits from 
    across the years. Glitter and platform heels will be the order
    of the day as  Glamrock band "Bulge" go on stage, celebrating 
    10 years since they debuted live for the first time, at the 
    Turk's Head.
    
    The bands are giving up their time for free to ensure that
    all the money raised on the night goes direct to the charity
    and Karen Peffer from Shooting Star is certainly looking 
    forward to it; "After the success of the first music night 
    that took place in March, we are delighted that this second
    event is taking place in St Margarets and we hope lots of 
    people will come and support us and enjoy the party!" 
    
    Tickets are L5 on the door and the music starts at 8.00 pm
