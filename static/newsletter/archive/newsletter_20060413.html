<p><em>13 April 2006</em></p>

<p>Welcome to the St Margarets Community Website Newsletter (<a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk">www.stmgrts.org.uk</a>).  Each Thursday we will send you the latest news and events from the website.</p>

<h2>Latest News</h2>


<!-- start include file /home/stmargarets/html/static/newsletter/news_story.incl -->

<h3><a href="/dynamicURL.cgi?URL=http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2006/04/the_easter_lind.html">The Easter Lindt?</a></h3>

<p><img src="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/easter_1-thumb.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="lindt egg" align="right" /></p>

<p>We just had a call from the manager of <a href="/dynamicURL.cgi?URL=http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/directory/home%20and%20garden/200507150408">Gift</a>  (2 Crown Road - 0208 891 1115). Apparently they have just had a huge delivery of Lindt Luxury Easter eggs, all are being sold at <em>40% less</em> than Tesco or Superdrug.</p>

<p>Gift wondered if we would like to hold a special draw for those members who have signed up for the newsletter (since we forgot to update the site with a new offer this month), with the lucky reader winning a Lindt Luxury Egg.</p>

<p>The 40% reduction offer is, I am told, also available at <a href="/dynamicURL.cgi?URL=http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/directory/general%20store/200506090425">Cutters</a>.</p>

<p>So we have had a draw and emailed one reader; hopefully, they will allow us to post their details.</p>

<h3><a href="/dynamicURL.cgi?URL=http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2006/04/new_pet_shop_op.html">New Pet Shop Opening</a></h3>

<p>Absolute Pets opens it&#8217;s doors on Friday, 14 April 2006 at 47b Crown Road St Margarets, the site of the former Mirror Shop.   The new shop will cater exclusively to cats and dogs.  The owners Lynda Vartuli and Glen Cardno have been on a whirlwind shopping trip to the States to bring back the latest must-have accessories for your pet, including designerwear, collars, leads, carry bags and fragrances from Pucci, Fox &amp; Hound, Dog Design, Cats Rule &amp; Paul Mitchell Grooming Products.  They also sell foods from Hills/Science, James Wellbeloved, Arden Grange and more.</p>

<h3><a href="/dynamicURL.cgi?URL=http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2006/04/who_is_the_st_m.html">Who is the St Margarets Association of Residents?</a></h3>

<p>After posting the <a href="/dynamicURL.cgi?URL=http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2006/03/reply_to_reside.html">Reply to Residents Group Letter on Proposed Indoor Soft Play Area</a> article, we recieved a  number of emails asking who the <em>St Margarets Association of Residents</em> was, so we asked them to pass along some information.</p>

<p>Turns out they didn&#8217;t have a website, so we have hosted a page for them <a href="/dynamicURL.cgi?URL=http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/static/info/smar.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3><a href="/dynamicURL.cgi?URL=http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2006/04/heathrow_expans.html">Heathrow Expansion Concerns</a></h3>

<p>The new Terminal 5 at Heathrow Airport and any increase in flights and changes to the flight paths will have an impact to the St Margarets&#8217; area and the quality of life we currently enjoy.  The <a href="/dynamicURL.cgi?URL=http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/directory/group/200510100724">Hacan Organisation</a> is a formidable pressure group making waves within Central government and at the European court.  </p>

<h3><a href="/dynamicURL.cgi?URL=http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2006/04/st_margarets_ro.html">St Margarets Roundabout Closure</a></h3>

<p>The St Margarets Roundabout will be closed at night from 10 pm to 5 am, from 2<sup>nd</sup> to 27<sup>th</sup> May. </p>

<p>Entry or exit from St Margarets Road will be blocked and through traffic on the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">A316 </span></span>will pass by under traffic light control.</p>
