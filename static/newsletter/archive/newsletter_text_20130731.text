----------------------------------------------------------------------

NEW COMPLETE BEGINNERS YOGA COURSES AT THE ETNA CENTRE
SEPTEMBER AND NOVEMBER 2013
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Gwyneth does it. Madonna does it. Marilyn Monroe used to do it way
    before it became a popular practice. But why? What are the
    benefits?

    Improved body tone, strength, flexibility, posture and energy are
    just some of the reasons to get on the mat and start practicing,
    as well as an opportunity to rejuvenate and relax.

    If you are a complete beginner and fancy trying it, join a
    Yoga-Fitness 'Complete Beginners Course'. This will introduce you
    into the world of Yoga and the key Yoga poses, enabling you to walk
    into any general yoga class with confidence.
