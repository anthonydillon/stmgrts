LATEST NEWS
===========================================================



MOOR MEAD AND FRIEND'S GROUP
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Thank you to everyone who has given their input and support so 
    far to the discussion regarding Moor Mead Park and thePavilion. 
    Since the initial meetings in Winchester Hall, with support 
    from the Council, we have achieved the following:
    
     - New playground
     - New bulb planting
     - Extra benches
     - Repainted the pavilion inside and outside 
       in preparation for refurbishment works
     - Had a trial with the Fitpoint -- outdoor gym

    With regards to the pavilion we have secured a grant 
    from St Margaret's Fair Committee and also additional funding 
    from the Council which means that we can go ahead with 
    refurbishing the building and making it fit for usethis will 
    include toilets, accessible kitchen and seatingarea. Work will 
    begin after the Fair and should be ready in time for a 
    summer opening.

'GROSS INCOMPETENCE' BY GAS COMPANY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Vincent Cable MP, St Margaret's councillors and local traders 
    have protested to the gas infrastructure company, National Grid 
    plc, at what Vincent Cable called "mind bogglingly incompetent
    project management".
    
    The work - replacing gas mains - started in the spring without
    any warning; was repeatedly interrupted; and then abandoned. 
    It was due to restart on 1st June and signs advertising the 
    fact were displayed, discouraging shoppers. But nothing 
    happened. The workers have never appeared.
    
    Vincent Cable has written to the company's Chief Executive
    to protest and to demand that a senior project manager be 
    put in charge to finish the work: "some of the utility 
    companies make a habit of digging up roads and pavements 
    for weeks on end. But this saga in St Margaret's has gone on 
    for months and is no nearer a resolution. The traders are 
    furious since their livelihoods are on the line. There should
    surely be some financial sanction when utilities cause 
    unnecessary inconvenience and loss to communities as National 
    Grid is doing."
    
      -- from local MP, Vince Cable

NO BAKER, JUST MORE ESTATE AGENTS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The old Koblers' Bakery building has apparently been sold by 
    Kimberley Foster, who also owns a series of now derelict shops, 
    including Artefact, Hairpin Bend and Laisy Daisy on St Margarets
    Road near the Brunnel site,  to Chase Buchanan, the estate agent
    who is seeking planning permission to change the building to A2
    use for their offices.
    
    According to the application:
    
        "This proposal is in keeping with the spirit and 
         direction of local planning and will protect the
         retail integrity of St Margarets Road whilst aiding 
         the growth of a successful local business 
         and employer."
         
    St Margarets will now have six shop fronts dedicated to Estate 
    Agents -- 18% of all shops.

TESCO PARKING AND RICHMOND COUNCIL'S CCTV
----------------------------------------------------------------------
        "The council recently applied for permission to use 
         CCTV images to issues parking tickets to people misusing 
         the loading bay, bus stop and double yellow lines outside
         Tesco.  This is a move that SPASM has been advocating 
         for some time, if only to show the true scale 
         of the problem.
         
         Sadly, it has been implemented in rather an unfortunate 
         way.  Ideally, a notice would have gone up warning people
         that CCTV was being used for parking control, as the ideal 
         number of parking tickets would have been zero, as people
         moved on to park or load legally.
         
         Instead, a large number of tickets seem to have been issued,
         in some cases, several to the same car as a batch of images
         has been analysed.
         
         This makes the whole exercise look like a cynical revenue
         raising scheme, rather than a positive way of reducing 
         the traffic issues in St Margarets.
         
         We urge the Council to erect prominent signs along that
         stretch of road so that people are aware that CCTV is and 
         has been used to issue parking tickets, to deter people 
         before they get a ticket, not after."
         
             -- from Nigel Cannings of SPASM
