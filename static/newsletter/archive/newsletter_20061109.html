<p><em>9 November 2006</em></p>

<p>Welcome to the St Margarets Community Website Newsletter (<a href="https://stmargarets.london">stmargarets.london</a>).  Each Thursday we will send you the latest news and events from the website.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2006/11/review_the_firs.html">Review: The First Stone</a></h3>

<p><img src="https://stmargarets.london/assets/images/2006/casale-cover-thumb.jpg" align="right" style="border: 1px solid #333; padding: 1px;" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>The First Stone</em> is the first novel by a local man, Guido Casale.  Guido has lived on the border of Old Isleworth and St Margarets since 1983 and both of his daughters have passed through the St Margarets schools, Orleans Infants and St Stephens.  Even though the names have been changed, the book takes place entirely in and around St Margarets.  All of the locations are clearly recognisable.  </p>

<p>The story itself is of two lives that become briefly intertwined &#8212; a young girl and a criminal posing as a neighbour.  Their lives have many strange parallels and they become dependant on each other for friendship.  The main plots are around a gold bullion robbery and the young girl&#8217;s struggle with growing up despite some mental and psychological struggles.</p>

<p>The story however is not a typical crime or psychological thriller, even though it has elements of both &#8212; it is really a powerful character drama.  The magic of Guido&#8217;s writing is ability to portray the story from both the perspectives of the man and the young girl.  You can see the world from they way they do &#8212; its beautifully done.</p>

<p>I highly recommend getting a copy.</p>

<p>You can purchase the book at the new agents next to the St Margarets Train Station.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2006/11/richmond_counci.html">Richmond Council Looks to Encourage Eco-Friendly Cars</a></h3>

<p>Richmond Council is looking at plans to use the <span class="caps">CPZ </span>parking permit fees to encourage cars with low <span class="caps">CO2 </span>emissions. The current proposal would actually lower the cost of permits for people with smaller, more efficient cars, but raise the price of a permit by 200% for the worst polluters.</p>

<p>According to a recent survey by primemove.com, Richmond borough is one of the most likely to have large 4&#215;4s, 63% more likely than the average area in London, with 5,099 cars registered since 2001.</p>

<p>Richmond Council is asking for feedback on this proposal with an online <a href="http://forms.richmond.gov.uk/AF3/an/default.aspx/RenderForm/?F.Name=NAJupv7axm0">questionnaire</a></p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2006/11/event_reminder_15.html">Event Reminder: Big Band Blitz 2006</a></h3>

<p><a href="/images/events/BigBandBlitz.jpg"></a></p>

<p>The Museum of Richmond will be the benefiting charity for the popular annual <a href="https://stmargarets.london/event/Show/200611051559">1940&#8217;s Big Band Blitz</a> at Clarendon Hall, York House, Twickenham on Saturday 18 November. This year the event will be part of the Queen&#8217;s 80th Birthday celebration.</p>

<p>The Mayor of Richmond and his guests will be stepping back in time to the 1940s.</p>

<p>Big Band Blitz will re-create a special 1940&#8217;s Glenn Miller wartime evening of big band music, dance and entertainment, featuring the legendary music of Glenn Miller and other Big Bands of the period.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2006/11/new_monday_jazz.html">New Monday Jazz Jam at The Rising Sun</a></h3>

<p><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/samleak.html"></a></p>

<p>There is a new weekly jazz fixture on Monday nights at <a href="https://stmargarets.london/directory/pub/200611051507">The Rising Sun</a> hosted by the Sam Leak Trio.  Sam says</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;with the Jam Session I am hoping to reach out particularly to the Jazzers in the Richmond and Twickenham community, whose numbers have been hugely elevated due to the fantastic course run by Jazz Bassist Dave Jones at the Richmond Adult Community College. I&#8217;d also like to attract many of the Jazz students around the area and London who are out there looking for Jam Sessions to play at and to meet up with other musicians. Aside from this from this I&#8217;m keen that Jazz enthusiasts (or even those with only a mild interest in Jazz!) and players of all levels come and check it out &#8212; whether to play or simply watch some (hopefully) great jamming, and to enjoy the gig in the first half of each session which will be featuring some great soloists each week!&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2006/11/licensing_subco.html">Licensing Sub-Committee Procedure Questioned</a></h3>

<p>A local resident has initiated a hearing at Richmond Magistrates&#8217; Court, for it to decide whether Richmond&#8217;s licensing sub-committee followed the correct procedure when it recently granted a licence to &#8216;Parvinu&#8217; for the proposed wine bar below Phelps. There were 89 written complaints from local residents, more than any other single licensing issue in St Margarets - including the recent applications for extension to hours from local pubs when the law changed.  At the onset of the meeting the Chairman announced that only 22 of these complaints would be taken into consideration as he had decided to set a boundary limit of 150 metres for valid objections.  Philip Morgan one of St Margarets local councillors (representing local residents) questioned the basis for this boundary.  He was told it was based on a licensing application regarding a Wetherspoon&#8217;s pub in the Midlands.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2006/11/remembering_ant.html">Remembering Anthony Wilkinson</a></h3>

<p>Sadly last week, Anthony Wilkinson died.  Anthony was a long serving station manager at the St Margarets station, who retired only a few years previously.  There is a condolence book at the station.</p>

<blockquote><p>Many residents will remember Tony from the St Margarets Railway Station. After a few years of semi-retirement, Tony died suddenly last week.</p>

<p>A keen photographer, cyclist, motor bike enthusiast, cook, gardener, calligrapher, wine and beer- maker he also taught himself how to play the flute and serenaded many of us over the years from the ticket kiosk.</p></blockquote>
