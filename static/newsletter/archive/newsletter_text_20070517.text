:: ST MARGARETS COMMUNITY WEBSITE NEWSLETTER :: 

17 May 2007

Welcome to the St Margarets Community Website Newsletter. 
Each Thursday we will send you the latest news and events from the website (http://www.stmgrts.org.uk).


LATEST NEWS
===========================================================



SITE NEWS: NEW FORUM
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    We have changed the forum software; however, you shouldn't have
    to re-register -- unless you had a username or email address that
    was from a Russian spam house or contained 'xxx', 'hodia',
    'cheap_rx' or anything similar questionable.

    Why the change?

    First of all, we should say that we never really liked the old
    forums for many reasons:

      -  Since it was based on a common bit of open source
        software (YABB) I constantly had a lot of spammers
        trying to get in and spend a fair amount of time
        deleting dummy user accounts.
      -  We felt the structure was far too rigid and forced
        conversations into tiny little topic areas.
      -  It didn't feel like part of the site.
      -  Usage was never very high compared to the article comments.

COACH HOUSE CAFE LOOKING FOR HELP
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    "Since reopening the Coach House Café in April we continue
     to be overwhelmed by the local support we've received and
     everyone we talk to is genuinely delighted that the café
     is open again and they seem very keen on what we have
     to offer.

     We are on the hunt for a really good café assistant, who
     can make great coffee (quickly) and who can look after
     the customers. It would work really well if we could
     offer this position to someone with the relevant skill
     and experience within the neighbouring St Margarets'
     community.  If you are interested, full details of the
     job can be obtained by emailing Jenni
     at the coachhousecafe@hotmail.co.uk".

STILL WANT TO LEARN & PLAY BRIDGE?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Learn & Play Bridge group (see article) at the Coach House
    Cafe in Marble Hill Park got off to a quiet start on Friday
    morning 11th May with a table of players enjoying a game.  Bridge
    teacher Ned Paul who has set up the weekly group with the support
    of the cafe commented:  "Time flew by as we got to grips with a
    few basic hands, although we were able to pause a long enough
    to have a cup of excellent coffee and a delicious piece of cake.
    I'd like a few more players to join in.  The group is ideal
    for anyone who would like to start bridge or for those who have
    played before but whose knowledge is a bit precarious.  The
    group is going forward on an informal basis where you need only
    attend those Fridays when you are free.  I'll ensure that
    everybody who comes progresses whatever your starting standard
    and however many sessions you can attend."

    The group meets at the Cafe at 10am on Fridays and plays
    until noon.
