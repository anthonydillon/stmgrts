LATEST NEWS
===========================================================



DETAILS EMERGE ON TESCO'S LOADING BAY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Last month the Richmond Council granted Tesco�s request for a 
    larger loading bay on St Margarets Road. Over the past few days 
    details have emerged regarding the specifics of the implementation 
    of the new loading bay. The actual implementation appears to be 
    far more lenient towards Tesco than previously suggested in the 
    Council�s Cabinet Report.
    
    It seems the bay will not only be longer, but substantially wider 
    than it currently is. Also, the rules for the bay will also be 
    more far more forgiving for Tesco and harder for residents than 
    they are currently.

AREA CONSULTATION MEETINGS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Area Consultation Meeting for St Margarets and North 
    Twickenham and Twickenham Riverside are scheduled for 31 October 
    in The Salon, York House. This is a good opportunity to meet our 
    local Councillors and Police Officers and have a say on issues of 
    local concerns, for example:

      *  graffiti and vandalism
      *  controversial planning and licensing issues
      *  loading bay, parking and traffic issues
      *  park restoration plans

    The St Margarets Community Website strongly urges residents to 
    come out and have a frank and open discussion. With an election 
    year coming up, we might find more willing ears.

    Council Planning Control Manager, David Barnes, asking the 
    Committee to reject the proposal for the wine bar under Streets
