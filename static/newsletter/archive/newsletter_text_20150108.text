LATEST NEWS
===========================================================



ï»¿THE AMIABLE CRANE
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Generally speaking the Crane is an amiable river. On its 9 mile
    journey from the source in North Hyde Road, Hayes, where it
    connects with Yeading Brook, to its exit into the Thames
    at Isleworth there is nothing to interrupt its leisurely progress.
    All is peace... until the final contrary kilometre. Twice a day,
    every day, the River Crane slows to a complete halt and then begins
    to turn back on itself. Instead of continuing on towards the Thames
    it moves in reverse, picking up speed, depth and sometimes
    ferocity.

JMW TURNER'S TWICKENHAM HOUSE 'SAVED' BY LOTTERY GRANT
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    A house designed and owned by JMW Turner is to be restored and
    opened to the public after receiving a 1.4m grant from the Heritage
    Lottery Fund. pounds

    Turner built Sandycombe Lodge in Twickenham, London, in 1813, and
    used it as his country retreat until 1826.

    But it has fallen into a poor state of repair in recent years.

    It has only been open to the public for one afternoon a month,
    but will be open for 46 weeks of the year from 2016, once
    restoration work is finished.

    Turner, one of Britain's greatest painters, designed the building
    as a retreat from his central London studio and as a permanent home
    for his elderly father, a retired wigmaker and barber, who looked
    after the house and garden.
