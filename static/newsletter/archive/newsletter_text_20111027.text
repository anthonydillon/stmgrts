ï»¿7 JANUARY 1928 - THE DAY THAT ST MARGARETS FLOODED
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The warning signs were in the local newspapers for all to see...

    - "Kew Garden sustained greater damage by the recent frost and
    snowfall than had been experienced for 40 years"

     - "Owing to the strong steam it took three tugs to tow and push two
    coal lighters through the centre arch of Richmond Bridge
    on Tuesday."

    - "Twenty three degrees of frost were registered at Kew Observatory
    at 7.00am last Saturday - a record low temperature for 1927."

    - "The thaw was accompanied during the night by the wind which
    at times rose to gale force. These heavy gusts, together with the
    thud of snow falling from the roofs, kept many Londoners awake."

TWICKENHAM STATION DEVELOPMENT - PUBLIC MEETING ON 18 OCTOBER 2011
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The meeting at York House, organised by TRAG, was attended by more
    than 200 local residents and councillors. TRAG presented two
    alternate plans for Twickenham Station redevelopment. Both plans
    are much smaller in scale than the proposed Solum plans.

    You can look at these plans, known as Plan B1 and Plan B2 and let
    us know what you think.

TONE UP VOICE WORKSHOPS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Inspiring creativity, confidence and well-being.

    This new and unique approach to health and wellbeing uses
    breathing, warm ups, stretches, and rhythmic and vocal exercises
    to develop the power and range of your voice and gain confidence
    in singing and speaking. Harnessing the power of your voice has
    many health benefits- among them relieving stress, working your
    abdominal core muscles, thereby helping to improve posture. It also
    stimulates the cardio-vascular system- in other words gives your
    body a good work-out
