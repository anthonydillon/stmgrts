ï»¿AN EXTRAORDINARY CHARACTER
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    "In the court of the evening, by particular desire of several
    persons of distinction, the celebrated CHEVALIERE D'EON will FENCE
    with a NOBLEMAN."

    On the evening of 23rd August 1793 the patrons of the Theatre
    Royal, Richmond were looking forward to a real treat. Included
    on the bill that evening was a fencing display by that acknowledged
    champion of the flashing blade - the Chevaliere d'Eon. This was the
    same person who on June 19th that year had received the personal
    congratulations of the Prince of Wales and his mistress Mrs
    Fitzherbert after a fencing demonstration that had shown "a vigour
    and firmness incredible".

    Unfortunately growing celebrity and royal approval did not please
    everyone at the theatre that night. One reviewer commented that the
    event was "a disgusting sight... a fine display of fencing by the
    Chevalier but in a dress that was scarcely decent."

MINSTER OF CHANCE CONTINUES
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Good news, locally produced Minister of Chance, a modern,
    pay-as-you-go radio-play is going to continue with Episode three.


    Dear friends,

    Thank you so much for making the Minister of Chance such a
    phenomenal success!

    We're thrilled to say the series will continue & we are now
    planning to record Episode 3 this autumn. Meanwhile, please do keep
    spreading the word... it's perfect for airport delays & sun-loungers!

    Dan and I are truly grateful for your support...

    Clare Eden

HEATHROW AIRPORT TO TEST 'MIXED-MODE' RUNWAY USE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    People living under Heathrow Airport's flight path have been sent
    leaflets about changes to rules that allow the use of both
    runways simultaneously.

    The runways are restricted to take-off or landing and switch each
    afternoon, except in an emergency, to give residents respite
    from the noise.

    As part of a trial starting next month the threshold for triggering
    the emergency system will be lowered.

    Airport operator BAA said it would allow it to minimise disruption.

    A BAA spokesperson said leaflets had been sent to 150,000 homes
    that would be affected by the trials.

    Under the changes, dual use can be deployed when a plane faces a
    10-minute wait to land or take off and if 30% of all flights are
    delayed by more than 15 minutes.

    The average time delay for flights at the west London airport is
    currently 12 minutes.

    The first trial finishes on 29 February while the second will run
    from 1 July 2012 until 30 September - coinciding with the
    London Olympics.

    John Stewart, chairman of the HACAN Clearskies campaign, said it
    was a major concern for people living in west London.

DREAMCATCHER FILM CAMP - 24 TO 28 OCTOBER 2011
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    After a very successful summer running Film Camps in Notting Hill,
    Elstree and Twickenham Film Studios, Dreamcatcher Media have
    announced their Mid-term break Film Camp running from 24th to 28th
    October. Director David O'Keeffe says;

    "We had a great summer with films being made on a whole range
    of subjects and completed to a very high standard indeed. It was
    wonderful to see the children being highly creative and coming
    up with their own film ideas."

    Some students have entered their films for film festivals with one
    picking up a prize at Bedford Park Festival in Chiswick early in
    the Summer.

    This Mid-term break the Camp for 8 - 16 year olds will run at Cole
    Court, London Road, Twickenham TW1 1HD from Monday 24th to Friday
    28th October. This new venue for us is minutes walk from Twickenham
    and St Margarets stations. It offers more space with the large
    house, including cafe and training rooms, set in its own beautiful
    grounds. Off-street parking spaces are available for pick ups and
    drop offs.

CREATIVITY IS KEY! BUCKING EMPLOYMENT TRENDS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The high cost of childcare and commuting is forcing women to give
    up their jobs to avoid ending up out of pocket, according to
    new research.

    The latest ONS Labour Force Survey says the number of women opting
    to look after their children instead of doing paid employment has
    risen by 32,000 nationally since last summer, with rising childcare
    costs being a key factor in their decision.

    However, local, entrepreneurial parents are taking matters
    into their own hands and returning to work under their own terms.

    Two examples of success are For Sanity's Sake co-founded by Rachel
    McLean and Andrea Quinteo, from Twickenham; and the local franchise
    of Caterpillar Music started by Emily and Tim Mascarenhas
    from Teddington.

    The paper will no longer be distributed, along with its sister
    title the Kingston Informer. The Informer's website

    being sustainable in the market.

    We would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our readers
    and advertisers who have supported the paper over the years.

    The Informer has had a proud tradition of being at the heart of the
