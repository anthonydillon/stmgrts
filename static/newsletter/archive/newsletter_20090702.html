<p><em>2 July 2009</em></p>

<p>Welcome to the St Margarets Community Website Newsletter (<a href="https://stmargarets.london">stmargarets.london</a>). Occasional Thursdays we will send you the latest news and events from the website.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2009/06/take_the_st_margarets_alliance_survey.html">Take the St Margarets Alliance Survey</a></h3>

<p><img src="http://www.stmargaretsalliance.com/imgs/logo1.jpg" alt="St Margarets Alliance" width="169" height="188" align="right" /></p>

<p>The St Margarets Alliance is <a href="https://stmargarets.london/sma_survey">asking all residents to complete a survey</a> as the first stage towards creating a Community Action Plan.  The Survey asks residents to consider which aspects of their local environment, economy, or social well-being are most important to them and to prioritise the most important and urgent.</p>

<p>Community Action Plans are central to the Sustainable Communities Act (SCA) of 2007, which aims to create a more local form of democracy.  The Plans are approved by the Secretary of State and funded from central government and community funds.  As such, Community Action Plans help communities to shape their economic, social and environmental well-being.</p>

<p><em>The group is non party-political and its purpose is to coordinate a Community Action Plan for the area. St Margarets Alliance does not have a specific agenda for the St Margarets area: the results of the Survey will form the basis for the basis of all future initiatives.  The group&#8217;s guiding principle is &#8216;residents first&#8217;.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://stmargarets.london/sma_survey/"><strong>Take the survey now</strong></a></p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2009/07/swap_our_schools.html">SWAP OUR SCHOOLS</a></h3>

<p>Last week, the Council, in the shape of Matthew Paul, braved a packed hall of parents at St Stephen&#8217;s, to explain the 2 form entry plans for Orleans and St Stephen&#8217;s.</p>

<p>In brief, to solve issues around pupil capacity and catchment areas, the Council proposes to build 2 new classrooms, plus ancillary buildings, at St Stephen&#8217;s and 5 new classrooms at Orleans.  Each school will then become a primary school, each with 2 forms serving Reception to Year 7.</p>

<p>Objections centred around three areas.  First, how on earth do you squeeze 60 more children into St Stephen&#8217;s, especially as Reception classrooms have to be bigger.  Second, how can you sensibly conduct building works on such a tiny site.  Third, and for many the most important, it will split the community.</p>

<p>Speaking personally, if the proposals had been implemented 10 years ago, all three of my children would never have met their best friends, and we would have not met many of the people we know today.  Football at Moormead would be fraught with inter-school rivalry, if it survived in its current form at all.</p>

<p>Yes, it can be a pain having to traipse from school to school.  Done it, and patched up the scraped knees from the railway bridge as well.</p>

<p>But do we want to see St Margarets split in two?  A lot of people work very hard for us to be seen as a homogeneous community, and not two villages separated by the A316.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2009/07/planning_developer_trying_to_avoid_providing_affor.html">Planning: Developer trying to avoid providing affordable housing</a></h3>

<p>The following application has just been brought to my attention.</p>

<p>Back last year application <a href="http://www2.richmond.gov.uk/PlanData2/planning_caseno.aspx?strCaseNo=08%2F0307%2FFUL">08/0307/FUL</a> was granted permission:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Redevelopment of the site to provide a 3-storey building comprising 17 private units (11 &#215; 1-bedoom and 6 &#215; 2-bedroom) and 10 affordable units (3 &#215; 1-bedroom for shared ownership and 2 &#215; 3-bedroom, 4 &#215; 2-bedroom and 1 &#215; 1-bedroom for social rent), basement parking for 20 vehicles and 27 cycle parking spaces, refuse and recycling storage and communal amenity space.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www2.richmond.gov.uk/PlanData2/planning_caseno.aspx?strCaseNo=08%2F0307%2FFUL">Read the Council&#8217;s notes</a></p>

<p>However there were a number of conditions attached, in particular U20861:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;No development shall begin until details of schemes for the provision of education, health, public realm, transport infrastructure and affordable housing to meet the needs of the development in accordance with the relevant policies of the Unitary Development Plan and the London Plan have been submitted to an approved in writing by the local planning authority.  The schemes shall include a timetable for the provision to be made and shall be carried out in accordance with the approved details.</p>

<p>REASON: to help off set the increased burden on local public infrastructure resulting from this development and to comply with the terms of the Council&#8217;s adopted Planning Obligations Strategy.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The developers are now applying to have this removed.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2009/07/the_marathon_de_sables_one_of_the_hardest_races_on.html">The Marathon de Sables: One of the hardest races on earth</a></h3>

<p><em>Why is this one of the hardest races on earth?</em></p>

<p>The race was first run 26 years ago when Patrick Bauer ran his own race unsupported across 300km of the Sahara. He wanted others to take part in a similar experience and set up the Marathon de Sables. Over 10,000 people have since run the race with over 800 competitors from around the world now racing each year. In the UK alone, there is a waiting list of 2000 people to even get on the race. So I am not alone in my madness to complete this challenge.</p>

<p>The race itself covers 151 miles of desert in sections of approximately 25, 34, 38, 82, 42, 22 km and this is run over 6 days (sometimes 7 if you do not finish the double marathon in the two days allowed). In addition to running one must carry all their equipment with them to survive for the duration of the race (so this is clothing, food, emergency medical kit, torch, compass, cooking equipment etc.) Water is rationed and handed out at each check point.</p>

<p>The temperatures mid day could reach 120 F degrees and the terrain will vary from rocks to sand with about 15-20% being run on sand dunes.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2009/06/the_best_ever_st_margarets_community_event.html">The Best Ever St Margarets Community Event</a></h3>

<p><img src="https://stmargarets.london/images/crstfair_summer09/stilts.JPG" alt="Crown Road Summer Fair 2009" height="150" width="100"  align="right" style="padding:2px;border: 1px solid #ccc;" /></p>


<p>What a lovely sunny day, Crown Road closed to traffic and a great chance to walk along the street and look at the shops and stalls whilst  mingling  with friends and neighbours.</p>

<p>At the top of the road Parvinu were lured out of the wine bar basement to set up antique tables and chairs in the street offering prosecco and a comfy chair. Our local community police officers had changed their shifts so that they could come and join in meeting local residents and offering to mark mobile phones and bicycles. Zoran was serving his usual high class burgers and Sunshine and Ravioli were doing a great trade in hot dogs. The crowds in the street were joined by Vincent Cable our local MP.</p>

<p>Centre stage was the Has St Margarets got Talent Contest held on the big stage donated by a local business man Gary Flynn at London Network Scaffolding. Residents were queuing up to display their talents from Tango dancing to street dancing and Irish dancing no shortage of singers and music from local bands. Chris from Rock and Fairy the new hairdressing salon seemed to feature in quite a few of the bands!  The talent show was hosted by John Stapleton and Lynn Faulds Wood. Amanda Holden was unable to attend at the last minute and the crowd was not disappointed when Peter Davison stepped in to help out.  Local star of TV&#8217;s  Gadget show Jason Bradbury and Gail Porter kept the crowd entertained and if you missed Jason&#8217;s amazing break dancing demo you really missed something spectacular.</p>

<p>The event was intended to raise both money and awareness of bowel cancer. Crown Road is the home of Lynn&#8217;s  Bowel Cancer Campaign and they said;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;What an amazing day  -  great for raising awareness of the symptoms of bowel cancer and lots of money raised too - which will help us to save even more lives. A big thank you to absolutely everyone involved especially Simon, Barry. Anita and Pete too for making all of our games&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>St Margarets is some times called the village by the estate agents but it certainly felt like a great place to be on Sunday 14<sup>th</sup> June.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2009/06/governor_vacancy_orleans_infant_school.html">Governor Vacancy - Orleans Infant School</a></h3>

<p>The Governing Body of Orleans Infant School currently has a vacancy for a Community Governor.
