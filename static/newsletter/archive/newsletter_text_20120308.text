ï»¿TALLY HO! WHAT! WHAT!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    It is hard to imagine but there was a time when St Margarets,
    with its streets and houses, shops and schools, was part of a vast
    royal hunting ground strictly preserved for the King and his
    nobles. It stretched from Windsor in the west, eastwards
    across Hounslow Heath towards the fringes of London and northwards
    into Hertfordshire. Its popularity as a Royal Chase was due in part
    to it being almost equidistant from London and Windsor, with Kew
    Palace and Hampton Court both adjacent. Long before estate agents
    started describing St Margarets as "the village" (oh, the horror!)
    our home was woodland and open heath echoing with cries of "View
    Halloa" and "Tally Ho!" as the wealthy went hawking, shooting,
    fishing and hunting stags and wild boars, deer and foxes...

RICHMOND COUNCIL CONSULTATION ON SIXTH FORMS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Richmond Council will be asking parents and other residents their
    views on statutory proposals to establish sixth forms in the
    borough's five maintained secondary schools.

    Over the past year, the head teachers of all the schools have been
    meeting regularly with Council officers and the Principal
    of Richmond upon Thames College to develop proposals. That work has
    now evolved into the formation of 'Richmond upon Thames Post-16
    Partnership' to move this agenda forward.

    In a series of five consultations, one for each non-academy school,
    residents will be asked for their views on the high-level vision
    and specification for each sixth form, outlining key issues such
    as intake numbers and the broad principles that will underpin each
    school's offer.

    The schools are committed to working together, in partnership
    with Richmond upon Thames College, to share expertise and enable
    young people to benefit from a broader range of local provision
    than is currently available.
