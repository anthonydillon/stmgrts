<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2006/07/event_reminder_6.html">Event Reminder : The 2006 St Margarets Fair</a></h3>

<p><img src="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/images/events/200602210457_2006_Fair.gif" width="150" height="212" alt="St Margarets Fair" align="right"  style="padding:2px;border:1px solid #ccc;" /></p>

<p>This year&#8217;s <a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/directory/charity/200507051436">St Margarets Fair</a> will be <a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/event/Fair/200602210457">held on Saturday, 15th July</a> from 11am to 7:30pm.  It is the 28th time the Fair has been held and is the centrepiece of the local calendar.</p>

<p>The Fair is a charity event and this year half of the income will go to the four local schools (Orleans Infant, St Stephen&#8217;s CE Junior, St Marys CE Primary and Orleans Park Schools) in the area and the remaining income will go towards the refurbishment of the <a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/directory/group/200510200949">Moormead Pavillion</a>, an important community resource in urgent need of repairs.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/static/fair/smf_06_programme.html">programme of events</a> for this year&#8217;s Fair include six bands, a football tournament, korfball, country dancing, a dog show, a charity auction and will be opened by Samantha Bond (aka Miss Moneypenny).</p>

<p><em>Come down for a great day out and help support your local community.</em></p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2006/07/abigail_cova_an.html">Abigail Cova and the Marble Hill Dance Studio</a></h3>

<p>Abigail has lived in St Margarets for six years, originally hailing from Scotland where she danced with Scottish Ballet, the country&#8217;s national ballet company.</p>

<p>Last year she opened <a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/directory/art/200607060232">Marble Hill Dance Studio</a>, which started with 20 students and now boasts 70, all through word of mouth. Abigail decided to open the school as she felt the area was lacking a local dance school. The school has 100% pass rate in all examinations taken including the Vocational Graded Royal Academy of Dance Syllabus. The school is based at her husband&#8217;s pub &#8212; <a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/directory/pub/200506090609">The Crown</a> that is situated on Richmond Road. The function room has been specially equipped with mirrors and barres to accommodate dance lessons.</p>

<p><em>We are running a series of articles from Georgie Islip, a local resident and fitness and nutrition specialist who runs a personal training company, GeoLifestyle in the area.  This second article is on &#8216;the benefits of exercise&#8217;&#8230;</em></p>


<p><strong>The Benefits of Exercise</strong></p>

<p>Exercise includes four core areas; these are cardiovascular fitness, flexibility, endurance and strength. Each component helps towards the feeling of well-being and healthiness. </p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2006/07/cllr_khosas_cpz.html">Cllr Khosa&#8217;s <span class="caps">CPZ</span> Consultation Update</a></h3>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;The council is currently in the process of reviewing its criteria for <span class="caps">CPZ</span>s throughout the Borough and the decisions about the consultation for our area have now had to be deferred till the autumn.</p>

<p>We continue to convey the urgency of our area to Cabinet members but have to abide by their timetable although I am told we are pretty much on the top as far as priority wards are concerned.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2006/06/moormead_pavili.html">Moormead Pavilion Cleaned Up </a></h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2006/06/moormead_park_c_1.html">Pavilion Clearing Out Day</a> was a big success.  According to Claire Wilson, </p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;We had over the course of the day about 50-60 helpers and made a fabulous start to the clearing out and cleaning up process.  The interior is emerging as having great potential for community use, the next stage is raising the funds to pay for the internal refurbishment requirements to make it fit for using.  Externally the first coat of paint has gone up, a great job done there by everyone involved, particularly the children who threw themselves into!<br />
 <br /><br /><br />
A huge thanks to everyone who took part. Stage 1 of reclaiming the pavilion completed.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
