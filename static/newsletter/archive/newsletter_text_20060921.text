REVIEW : BROOK'S BLUES BAR
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Last night we decided to try the new Thursday evening fixture at 
    the Turk's Head Pub, Brook's Blues Bar.  On stage were Fran 
    McGillvray and Mike Burke who played two great sets of classic 
    acoustic blues well into the night.  The atmosphere of Winchester 
    Hall was lovely with candle lit tables, a not to loud sound 
    system, light food and a bar.  Its has more of a club feel than 
    a concert, so great to bring your friends.  
    
    For £7 its a good value and a fun night out -- highly recommended.

YOUR SAY 2017 &MDASH; A NEW CONSULTATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    On 13th October a new consultation starts to help determine the 
    future of the next Community Plan for 2007-2017.  Your Say 2017 
    is a campaign being launched by the Local Strategic Partnership, 
    a group of organisations whose aim is to work together to improve 
    services within the borough, including the Police and the 
    health services. 

    The consultation will take the form of a website through which 
    residents and local people can record their views on key 
    priorities.  People can go online and register from the 19th  
    September and then it will go live from the 13th October to 
    3rd November 2006.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
    After 9 weeks of fierce competition, the 1st Richmond Summer 
    League run by Whitton Volleyball Club has named its winners. The

ST MARGARETS FAIR UPDATE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    This year's July Fair raised a record £18,000, and here's where 
    the money is going.
    
    £1,500 pays for Christmas presents and a meal in the Turks Head 
    for many of St Margarets older residents. There's a £500 donation 
    to Marble Hill Play Centres. As always the four local schools 
    receive around 50% of the profits, distributed on a points system
    awarded for the tasks they undertook for the Fair.
