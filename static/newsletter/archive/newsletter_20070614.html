<p><em>14 June 2007</em></p>

<p>Welcome to the St Margarets Community Website Newsletter (<a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk">www.stmgrts.org.uk</a>). Each Thursday we will send you the latest news and events from the website.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2007/06/moor_mead_and_friends_group.html">Moor Mead and Friend&#39;s Group</a></h3>

<p>Thank you to everyone who has given their input and support so far to the discussion regarding Moor Mead Park and the Pavilion. Since the initial meetings in Winchester Hall, with support from the Council, we have achieved the following:</p>


<ul>
<li>New playground</li>
<li>New bulb planting</li>
<li>Extra benches</li>
<li>Repainted the pavilion inside and outside in preparation for refurbishment works</li>
<li>Had a trial with the Fitpoint &#8212; outdoor gym</li>
</ul>


<p>With regards to the pavilion we have secured a grant from St Margaret&#8217;s Fair Committee and also additional funding from the Council which means that we can go ahead with refurbishing the building and making it fit for use this will include toilets, accessible kitchen and seating area. Work will begin after the Fair and should be ready in time for a summer opening.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2007/06/gross_incompetence_by_gas_company.html">&#39;Gross Incompetence&#39; by Gas Company</a></h3>

<p>Vincent Cable <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">MP,</span></span></span> St Margaret&#8217;s councillors and local traders have protested to the gas infrastructure company, National Grid plc, at what Vincent Cable called &#8220;mind bogglingly incompetent project management&#8221;.</p>

<p>The work - replacing gas mains - started in the spring without any warning; was repeatedly interrupted; and then abandoned. It was due to restart on 1st June and signs advertising the fact were displayed, discouraging shoppers. But nothing happened. The workers have never appeared.</p>

<p>Vincent Cable has written to the company&#8217;s Chief Executive to protest and to demand that a senior project manager be put in charge to finish the work: &#8220;some of the utility companies make a habit of digging up roads and pavements for weeks on end. But this saga in St Margaret&#8217;s has gone on for months and is no nearer a resolution. The traders are furious since their livelihoods are on the line. There should surely be some financial sanction when utilities cause unnecessary inconvenience and loss to communities as National Grid is doing.&#8221;</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2007/06/no_baker_just_more_estate_agents.html">No Baker, Just More Estate Agents</a></h3>

<p>The old Koblers&#8217; Bakery building has apparently been sold by Kimberley Foster, who also owns a series of now derelict shops, including Artefact, Hairpin Bend and Laisy Daisy on St Margarets Road near the Brunnel site,  to Chase Buchanan, the estate agent who is seeking <a href="http://www.ukplanning.com/richmond/showCaseFile.do?councilName=London+Borough+of+Richmond+upon+Thames&amp;appNumber=07%2F1816%2FCOU">planning permission</a> to change the building to A2 use for their offices.</p>

<p>According to the application:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;This proposal is in keeping with the spirit and direction of local planning and will protect the retail integrity of St Margarets Road whilst aiding the growth of a successful local business and employer.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>St Margarets will now have six shop fronts dedicated to Estate Agents &#8212; 18% of all shops.</p>

<p>If you would like to comment on the application, you may do so <a href="http://www.ukplanning.com/richmond/createComment.do;jsessionid=3DAEFAB1054AFD969FF67B2E4EBD537F.wam2?action=CreateApplicationComment&amp;applicationType=PLANNING%20FOLDER&amp;appNumber=07%2F1816%2FCOU">here</a>.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2007/06/tesco_parking_and_richmond_councils_cctv.html">Tesco Parking and Richmond Council&#39;s <span class="caps">CCTV</span></a></h3>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;The council recently applied for permission to use <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">CCTV </span></span></span>images to issues parking tickets to people misusing the loading bay, bus stop and double yellow lines outside Tesco.  This is a move that <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">SPASM </span></span></span>has been advocating for some time, if only to show the true scale of the problem.</p>

<p>Sadly, it has been implemented in rather an unfortunate way.  Ideally, a notice would have gone up warning people that <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">CCTV </span></span></span>was being used for parking control, as the ideal number of parking tickets would have been zero, as people moved on to park or load legally.</p>

<p>Instead, a large number of tickets seem to have been issued, in some cases, several to the same car as a batch of images has been analysed.</p>

<p>This makes the whole exercise look like a cynical revenue raising scheme, rather than a positive way of reducing the traffic issues in St Margarets.</p>

<p>We urge the Council to erect prominent signs along that stretch of road so that people are aware that <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">CCTV </span></span></span>is and has been used to issue parking tickets, to deter people before they get a ticket, not after.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
