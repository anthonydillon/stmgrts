<p><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/directory/restaurant/200809111151">Parvinu at Phelps</a> has now opened providing St Margarets with a new wine bar with food.</p>

<p>They have been open for two weeks and when your website reporter called in the other evening seemed to be nicely busy. The bar has a great atmosphere, primarily due to the mix customers they seem to be attracting . Gavin Mitchell told us</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;As you know we always believed that a responsibly managed bar offering excellent wines and easy dining in a comfortable setting would be well received in a community such as St Margarets. Judging by the response we have had so far we seem to be catering to the right audience and delivering at the right level. We aim to ensure that we maintain our standards and enhance our offering so that we can consolidate ourselves as a positive addition and be a contributor to the local community.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><cite> &#8212; <em>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</em> 1956</cite></p>

<p>Sometimes I feel like a character in one of those cheesy 1950&Otilde;s science fiction films. You know the type. There&Otilde;s a handsome hero, his beautiful girlfriend and a crusty professor and <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">THEY ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE</span></span></span> IN <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">THE ENTIRE WORLD</span></span></span>!!! who know that their little town has just been invaded by aliens&Eacute;and is anyone listening to them? <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">NOOOOOOOOOO</span></span></span>!!!!!</p>

<p>Well friends, before you turn over to the other channel let me tell you that it is happening here in St Margarets and this time there are three of them! Holy Moley! They all come from the East and if left unchecked they will be shortly parking on your front lawn and asking if they can borrow a cup of sugar.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/alce_gallery-thumb.jpg" width="150" height="112" alt="Alce Harfield's work" align="right" style="padding: 2px; border: 1px solid #ccc;" /></p>


<p>Come see an exhibition of Art work by the artist Alce Harfield at the The Hampton Hill Playhouse.</p>

<p>Alce was born in Sussex in 1966 into an unusually artistic family. She grew up surrounded by photographers, art teachers, architects and printmakers, so it came as no surprise when she embarked on an artistic career of her own. Alce studied at Worthing College of Art, prior to gaining an honours degree from Leicester Polytechnic.</p>

<p>Painted in acrylics on canvas and paper, Alce&#8217;s work betrays a wide range of influences and is eager to experiment. She is well known for her broad spectrum of work, including landscapes and cityscapes, figurative pieces and more whimsical contemporary imagery.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2008/09/raising_money_for_romanian_childrens_charity.html">Raising money for Romanian children&#39;s charity</a></h3>

<p>St Margarets residents and their friends of St Margarets have come together to challenge themselves &#8212; get fit, have fun, and get to know their fellow neighbours, all in the name of charity.</p>

<p>The initiative has been inspired by the work of <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">F.R.O.D.O. </span></span></span>(Foundation for the Relief of Disabled Orphans), a UK charity which provides medical treatment and care to disabled children who have been orphaned or abandoned in developing countries. With the highest incidence of abandonment in the world, Romania is the initial focus for the charity. The results achieved here on behalf of this vulnerable group in the two years since it was founded have been significant with over 180 children helped directly.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;It is the clarity and directness of the work which makes <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">F.R.O.D.O. </span></span></span>such an exciting organisation to support,&#8221; said Julie Hollyer one of the St Margarets <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">F.R.O.D.O. </span></span></span>group. &#8220;It&#8217;s run by a small team in the UK but continually punches above its weight in its ambitions and achievements.&#8221; Our aim is to raise enough money to send a Treatment &amp; Training team from the UK to Romania which could treat as many as 70 children. It&#8217;s also about showing our kids that life is a lottery, just two hours away there are children who are dying from completely curable conditions. The campaign will include a fundraising and learning programme in local schools.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The target is &#163;25,000 which the supporters confidently believe is achievable. Events over the next 8-10 months will include sponsored sporting events, The Great St Margarets Dine Out, wardrobe swap and a school&#8217;s programme to involve the children in the campaign.</p>

<p>The charity initiative was launched at St Margarets Fair with a cake stall which succeeded in raising over &#163;700.</p>

<p><strong>The next big event is the <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">F.R.O.D.O. </span></span></span>team in the London Duathlon on September 14 in Richmond Park. Ten runners and cyclists from the area and the charity will be taking part with the aim of raising &#163;5,000 towards the target. All sponsors and cheerer ons are welcome.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2008/07/disabled_mans_charity_parachute_jump.html">Michael Hanrahan</a> did his charity parachute jump on 12 August.</p>

<p>A very big thank you to everyone who sponsored him at the quiz night. He raised a total of &#163;350.20 on the night and a further &#163;440 online.

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2008/09/event_reminder_days_of_wine_and_roses.html">Event Reminder: Days of Wine and Roses</a></h3>

<p><img src="http://stmgrts.org.uk/images/events/Wine-n-Roses_thumb.jpg" width="99" height="150" alt="Nikki Squire as Mona with Kevin Boland as Donal" align="right" style="padding: 2px; border: 1px solid #ccc;" /></p>

<p>Next up from the Richmond Shakespeare Society is Owen McCafferty&#8217;s poignant love story <a href="http://stmgrts.org.uk/event/play/200705141906">Days of Wine and Roses</a>, on stage at Twickenham&#8217;s Mary Wallace Theatre from September 13 to 20.</p>

<p>Originally a 1958 teleplay written by a Texan which transferred to the big screen with Jack Lemmon and Lee Remick,it was reset for the stage by Northern Irish writer Owen McCafferty and relocated to London in the Swinging Sixties.</p>

<p>Two people, Donal and Mona, meet for the first time at Belfast Airport in 1962, awaiting their delayed flight as they move to live in London. Donal is a bookie&#8217;s clerk, Mona a civil servant with a sheltered family life, but after one drink she begins to change &#8212; and many more drinks follow.</p>

<p>Gradually their marriage turns to dust as Mona is drawn deeper and deeper into alcoholism &#8212; until finally Donal resolves to return to Belfast, the city of his birth, taking little Kieran with him.</p>

<p>Director and Swan Award winner Chris Hurles says: &#8220;Nikki Squire and Kevin Boland put their hearts and souls into the demanding roles of Donal and Mona. As strangers in a strange city, they fall in love with life and each other &#8212; but as alcohol takes its grip, their lives increasingly spiral out of control.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a very powerful play with adult themes and graphic scenes, so it&#8217;s not really suitable for children.&#8221;</p>

<p>Performances run from Saturday September 13 at 7.45pm, with Sunday&#8217;s show a 4pm matinee and no Wednesday show. Tickets &#163;8 or &#163;10.</p>

<p>As <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">RSS </span></span></span>is a Club Theatre, tickets may only be sold to members by post, phone or from Box Office, Mary Wallace Theatre, Embankment, Twickenham, <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">TW1</span></span></span> 3DU, 020 8744 0547, <a href="http://www.rss-mwt.org.uk/">www.rss-mwt.org.uk</a> Bookings must be secured by credit card, or by cash or cheque within three days. Membership 020 8940 1606, <a href="mailto:%6D%65%6D%62%65%72%73%68%69%70%40%72%73%73%2D%6D%77%74%2E%6F%72%67%2E%75%6B">membership@rss-mwt.org.uk</a>.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2008/09/new_jazz_class_at_racc.html">New Jazz Class at <span class="caps">RACC</span></a></h3>

<h4>Arranging For Bands and Composing</h4>

<p>The Richmond Adult Community College Jazz Faculty is running a new 36 week course starting later this month targeted at musicians who want to improve their arranging and composing skills.</p>

<p>The course will be running between 10.00 and 12.00 every Saturday morning (to avoid overlap with the Saturday afternoon ensembles).</p>

<p>Some pre-knowledge and understanding of Jazz harmonic structure and basic arranging principles would be useful but not essential - for those new to the subject there are some excellent &#8216;standard works&#8217; such as Henry Mancini&#8217;s &#8216;Sounds and Scores&#8217; and Don Sebesky&#8217;s The Contemporary Arranger&#8217; which would be useful pre reading. (I have copies you can borrow!) The cost will be probably &#163;150 per term or &#163;400 for three terms though this depends on the number of students we can get.</p>

<p>&#8220;A great opportunity to develop new Jazz arranging skills&#8221;</p>

<h4>Why should I sign up to this course?</h4>

<p>We are very lucky to have the Richmond Adult College Jazz faculty on our doorstep and many of us have attended and enjoyed the Saturday afternoon Jazz workshops.</p>

<p>The college has some great tutors and first class resources.</p>

<p>&#8216;Arranging For Bands and Composition&#8217; has been developed for musicians who want to be able to create their own scores and arrangements for anything ranging from a small Jazz ensemble to a big band across a range of musical styles.</p>

<p>It is developed from a short course run at Parkshot this summer. The classes will be taught using Sibelius software and Pro Studio. There will be opportunities to have worked performed by the Faculty ensembles.</p>

<p>This is a great opportunity to improve existing musical skills and to develop new capabilities - possibly even earn some money from on line publishing via Sibelius.com.</p>

<p>However we need at least eight people to sign up to make the course viable and at the moment there are only four of us so if you are interested, e-mail me at <a href="mailto:%67%65%6F%66%66%40%72%74%74%6F%6E%6C%69%6E%65%2E%63%6F%6D">geoff@rttonline.com</a> for a detailed course outline or phone me 0208 892 6433 for more information.</p>

<h4>Breaking news on The Rising Sun</h4>

<p>Many of you have provided great support for our Jazz Showcase evenings at The Rising Sun every Monday.</p>

<p>The pub is being refurbished but will re open for Jazz on Monday 29th September - more details to follow and keep an eye on the new web site <a href="http://www.risingsuntwickenham.co.uk/">www.risingsuntwickenham.co.uk</a></p>

<p>See you then</p>
