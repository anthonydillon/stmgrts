<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2006/11/event_reminder_17.html">Event Reminder: Christmas Shooting Star Night</a></h3>

<p><img src="https://stmargarets.london/images/events/Skaband_thumb.jpg" width="150" height="98" alt="Ska Band" style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding:1px;" align="right" /></p>

<p>December will be ushered in with a special <a href="https://stmargarets.london/event/Show/200611021616">Shooting Start Winter Party</a> at the Turks Head on Friday 1st December in aid of The Shooting Star Children&#8217;s Hospice. This will definitely put everyone in the mood for a festive Christmas period before getting bogged down with all that Christmas shopping.</p>

<p>With four terrific local Twickenham bands playing a wide range of music, from Motown to Glamrock, it promises to be a fun-filled evening. The headline act is  &#8220;The Shooting Ska Allstars&#8221; playing their highly infectious blend of Reggae and Ska music.  &#8220;The Funk Bomb Detonators&#8221; kick off the evening with 60&#8217;s Soul and Motown numbers and St Margarets&#8217; very own &#8220;Doghouse&#8221;  will be playing a great selection of hits from across the years. Glitter and platform heels will be the order of the day as  Glamrock band &#8220;Bulge&#8221; go on stage, celebrating 10 years since they debuted live for the first time, at the Turk&#8217;s Head.</p>

<p>The bands are giving up their time for free to ensure that all the money raised on the night goes direct to the charity and Karen Peffer from Shooting Star is certainly looking forward to it; &#8220;After the success of the first music night that took place in March, we are delighted that this second event is taking place in St Margarets and we hope lots of people will come and support us and enjoy the party!&#8221; </p>

<p>Tickets are &#163;5 on the door and the music starts at 8.00 pm</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2006/11/event_reminder_16.html">Event Reminder: The Good Wine Shop Tasting</a></h3>

<p><img src="https://stmargarets.london/images/events/mark_good_wine_thumb.jpg" width="150" height="112" alt="Mark of The Good Wine Shop" style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding:1px;" align="right"  /></p>

<p><a href="https://stmargarets.london/directory/wine_aNd_spirits/200511281416">The Good Wine Shop</a> in Isleworth is hosting a special pre-Christmas <a href="https://stmargarets.london/event/Exhibition/200611131514">wine tasting event</a>.</p>

<p>A selection of more than 50 quality wines will be on offer for guests to sample during the evening event which takes place at Winchester Hall on Wednesday 22nd November, 6.00pm to 9.00pm. </p>

<p>Owner Mark Wrigglesworth will be on hand to help guests decipher their Rioja from their Riesling and offer expert tips and advice on choosing the best wines for all occasions. Guests will also be able to enjoy a range of carefully selected breads, meats and cheeses to compliment the red, white and sparkling wines. Mark said, </p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;We believe wine is all about enjoyment. There can be a certain snobbery surrounding wines but at The Good Wine Shop we aim to break down those barriers, offering the finest vintages from the world&#8217;s best small producers, which wouldn&#8217;t normally be found on the high street.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Special pre-Christmas offers will be available at the event. Tickets can be purchased from The Good Wine Shop in advance at a cost of &#163;7.50 per person or &#163;10.00 on the door.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2006/11/letter_to_the_e.html">Letter to the Editor: The Gas Man Cometh (NOT!)</a></h3>

<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m just wondering if anyone knows how much longer British Gas / Transco / whomever is responsible these days are going to leave the hole (or holes, as they have now become) blocking the pavement in St Margarets Road (opposite Taylor&#8217;d Lighting)?</p><p>
I think it was about three weeks ago that the first one appeared, surrounded by &#8220;Pavement Closed&#8221; signs - unfortunately you can&#8217;t just arbitrarily close the pavement there, there is no other route to walk in to St Margarets from many houses in the area.</p><p>
Just under a week after the hole appeared, on the Saturday, some men arrived and did a bit more work.  Presumably they were not on a good enough overtime rate, for they only did about half a day&#8217;s work then disappeared.</p><p>
The following Saturday some more work was done and a further, much bigger hole appeared.  The pavement was still &#8220;closed&#8221;, those of us with children had by then push some of the signs floating around the area in to the road such that cars would be forced to give us some space.</p><p>
Now after three weeks someone somewhere has seen some sense and placed barriers to force the cars to move across and mark out a proper pedestrian route around the holes &#8212; but there is no sign of any work taking place in or around the holes at all.</p><p>
How much longer will they be there?  Are we just expected to put up with this ignorant behaviour by our utility companies?</p></blockquote>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2006/11/review_the_firs.html">Review: The First Stone</a></h3>

<p><img src="https://stmargarets.london/assets/images/2006/casale-cover-thumb.jpg" align="right" style="border: 1px solid #333; padding: 1px;" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>The First Stone</em> is the first novel by a local man, Guido Casale.  Guido has lived on the border of Old Isleworth and St Margarets since 1983 and both of his daughters have passed through the St Margarets schools, Orleans Infants and St Stephens.  Even though the names have been changed, the book takes place entirely in and around St Margarets.  All of the locations are clearly recognisable.  </p>

<p>The story itself is of two lives that become briefly intertwined &#8212; a young girl and a criminal posing as a neighbour.  Their lives have many strange parallels and they become dependant on each other for friendship.  The main plots are around a gold bullion robbery and the young girl&#8217;s struggle with growing up despite some mental and psychological struggles.</p>

<p>The story however is not a typical crime or psychological thriller, even though it has elements of both &#8212; it is really a powerful character drama.  The magic of Guido&#8217;s writing is ability to portray the story from both the perspectives of the man and the young girl.  You can see the world from they way they do &#8212; its beautifully done.</p>

<p>I highly recommend getting a copy.</p>

<p>You can purchase the book at the new agents next to the St Margarets Train Station.</p>
