ST MARGARETS CPZ : LETTER ON "STOPPING UP ORDER"
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    We have received the following letter regarding the odd inclusion
    on in the CPZ survey about the road behind Taylor'd Lighting 
    on St Margarets Road.
    
      "A questionnaire has been circulated this week to all 
       who could be affected by the proposed St Margarets CPZ. 
       My comments here are not about the main thrust
       of the questionnaire but about Question 4: - "Are you 
       in favour of the proposed stopping up order at the 
       rear of 141-143 St Margarets Road?"

ST MARGARETS' CONTROLLED PARKING ZONE SURVEY CIRCULATED
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The St Margarets Controlled Parking Zone (CPZ) Survey was 
    distributed this weekend.  Residents given the survey have until
    15 June 2007 to complete it.  The CPZ was a major issue 
    in the last election and remains a divisive issue 
    for the community.
    
    Also, the Council is to hold exhibitions with detailed plans 
    at the Winchester Hall next to the Turks Head on Tuesday 5th 
    and Thursday 7th June from 4pm to 8pm. In attendance will be 
    your local councillors and council officers from the Transport 
    Department. In addition the councillors will be happy to meet 
    up at alternative times should this be necessary.

DEATH OF A LOCAL POSTMAN
----------------------------------------------------------------------

      "It is with great sadness that I am writing to report 
       the tragic death of James 'Mario' Seebrook, who was
       the son of a close friend of mine. James had been 
       missing for a few weeks before he was found. He was
       a well liked member of the community, being a local
       postman, who always had a good word for everyone. He 
       will be sadly missed."
       
     -- from Tricia Ford
