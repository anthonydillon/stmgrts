<h3>Brula Gets 8 Out of 10 from The Guardian</h3>

<p>Local restuarant, Brula was given an excellent review in this Saturday&#8217;s The Guardian.</p>

<blockquote><p>If there is one thing that would most improve the quality of life for those of us living in the more piquant areas of urban Britain - apart, perhaps, from roadsweepers prepared to go that vital step beyond their strict contractual obligations and occasionally sweep the road - that thing would be a great neighbourhood restaurant 50 yards from our door. All my adult life, I was reflecting after lunch at Brula, I have dreamed of having such a place at the end of the road, perhaps in place of the bail hostel against the wall of which one of the neighbours was taking a decorous leak as I ambled past doing the reflecting.</p>

<p>Brula, alas, is miles away in Twickenham. It is 50 yards from a colleague&#8217;s front door, however, and should you ever take the Simon Hoggart Tour, do ask the guide to stop off there for lunch. Simon, I notice from a perfunctory Googling, has never mentioned Brula in his writings, and no wonder. Only a madman would give directions to a hidden gem such as this.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
