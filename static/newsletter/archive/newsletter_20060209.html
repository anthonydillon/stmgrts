<h3>A Star-Studded Night in St Margarets</h3>

<p>A <a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/cgi-bin/events.cgi?key=200602091031&amp;action=getevent">great night of music</a> is planned for Friday 10<sup>th</sup> March at the Winchester Hall, <a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/cgi-bin/directory.cgi?key=200505231518&amp;action=getlisting">Turks&#8217; Head</a> all in aid of a great local charity, <a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/cgi-bin/directory.cgi?key=200602091019&amp;action=getlisting">The Shooting Star Children&#8217;s Hospice</a>.</p>

<p>Toby Hartwell, a local resident for the last 20 years or so, is running this Year&#8217;s London marathon and aiming to raise &#163;2000 for the charity. He explains,  &#8220;At my good friend Phil Cutts&#8217;s 50<sup>th</sup> Birthday we both decided to accept the challenge of running the marathon and I was keen to put the hard work involved to a useful end by raising funds for Shooting Star. My children were both at St Stephen&#8217;s and little Orleans schools and much of the fund-raising at the school during their time there contributed to the building of the children&#8217;s hospice.&#8221; Shooting Star now needs over &#163;2,000,000 a year just to keep going and they rely purely on donations. Phil is running for the Macmillan Cancer Relief and they can be both regularly seen plodding round Richmond Park.</p>

<p>For March 10<sup>th</sup> Toby called on a number musical friends who live locally and they have all gladly given up their time for this worthy cause.  The evening promises to be a lot of fun. Tickets are &#163;5.00 on the door and their will an auction of some very desirable items including a Fender guitar and amplifier and Virgin balloon flights. The music starts at 8.00. All the money raised goes direct to the charity.</p>

<h3>Levelling of Moormead Park has Started</h3>

<p>Approximately one quarter of the lawn of Moormead Park is currently being levelled and re-seeded.  The money was provided by a grant given to St Stephen&#8217;s Junior School and will allow the school to make better use of the park as playing fields.</p>
