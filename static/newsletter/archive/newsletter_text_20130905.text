ï»¿THE RIVULET OF HAPPY FAMILIES
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Unless you are one of those lucky souls who actually has the River
    Crane gurgling away at the bottom of your garden you may be unaware
    of the river or forgotten it. In the early 1930's the writer A.G
    Linney paid a visit to the river and was so taken by what he saw
    that he later described it as "A Rivulet of Happy Families" - a
    little flowery perhaps but true nevertheless. Well, the Crane does
    flow through St Margarets, doesn't it, which most of us think of
    as a demi-paradise, full of happy people skipping down
    flower-strewn streets to enjoy coffee at one of the many outlets.
    This is what Linney wrote in 1932...

EVENT REMINDER: GREAT ANNUAL STREET SALE - 14 SEPTEMBER 2013
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    It's a Guaranteed GASS!

    There are times when the stuff that we accumulate around ourselves
    threatens to take over our lives. Shelves groan under the weight
    of unread books and record racks creak with unplayed CDs. Cupboards
    are stuffed with things that we don't even know we had and
    wardrobes are hung with clothes that went out of fashion when David
    Bowie abandoned the 3 inch stack heel for lounge suits. What can we
    do about it all? There are 3 possible solutions:

    1. Do nothing until the neighbours wonder, "Whatever happened to old
       so-and-so?" and our bodies are found buried under a mountain
       of David Cassidy albums, Dan Brown books and rusting Swiss
       Fondue sets.
    2. Take everything to your local charity shop
    3. Take it all to GASS and sell it.

    Term time is starting again, and it's no different for Fetch! puppy

    time to start training and socialising them. Our Puppy Life Skills
    Classes are designed to provide a foundation of new skills for your
    puppy and help prevent problem behaviours developing as they
    mature. The Puppy Life Skills Classes are held at St Margarets
    Catholic Church and there is no waiting for a course to begin. You
    can start within days of contacting us and the flexible schedule
    allows you to attend to suit your diary and your
    puppy's requirements.

RISC RELEASES REPORT ON FAITH-BASED ADMISSIONS DISCRIMINATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    In a new report, Richmond Inclusive Schools Campaign (RISC) claim
    that faith-based admissions to local church primary schools are
    significantly restricting the choices available to non-churchgoing
    parents. Recently Vince Cable called for local faith schools to be
    more "community minded" in their admissions. The RISC report
    suggests simple changes their governing bodies could make to
    do that.
