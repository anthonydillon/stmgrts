HAVE YOU CHECKED UP ON YOUR HEALTH?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    As we near the end of summer, make sure you take time to check up
    on your health and wellbeing by booking in for a free NHS
    Health Check.

    When we get older we have a higher risk of developing conditions
    like high blood pressure, heart disease or type 2 diabetes. Your
    free NHS Health Check can spot early signs and help prevent these
    happening to you which means you'll be more likely to enjoy life
    for longer.
