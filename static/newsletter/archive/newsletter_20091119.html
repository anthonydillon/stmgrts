<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2009/11/st_margarets_community_action_plan_stage_2_survey.html">St Margarets Community Action Plan: Stage 2 Survey Now Online</a></h3>

<p>Stage 2 of the St Margarets Residents&#39; Survey is now available for completion online.  The Survey sets out the issues and solutions most frequently stated in the Stage 1 Survey and invites residents to comment on them as well as adding any further thoughts or ideas.  Those who completed Survey at the Results Evening on 15th September do not need to complete this version, which has mainly been fine-tuned for clarity.  You are also welcome to complete Stage 2 even if you didn&#39;t complete the Stage 1 Survey. </p>

<p>As it took longer than anticipated to finalise the online version of Stage 2 and to meet with LBRUT, Alliance has postponed the meeting originally scheduled for Tuesday 17th November at the Winchester Hall and an alternative date will arranged - this is likely to be after Christmas.</p>

<p>LBRUT is currently offering assistance with seeking the views of under-represented groups in the area and progressing the Plan.</p>

<p>If you would like to be kept informed of future developments please contact <a href="mailto:%61%6C%6C%69%61%6E%63%65%75%70%64%61%74%65%40%62%74%69%6E%74%65%72%6E%65%74%2E%63%6F%6D">allianceupdate@btinternet.com</a></p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2009/11/the_crane_park_shot_tower.html">The Crane Park Shot Tower</a></h3>

<p><img src="https://stmargarets.london/images//shot_tower_2_thumb.png" width="150" height="116" alt="cartoon" align="right" style="padding: 2px; border: 1px solid #ccc;" /></p>

<p><em>How to make Musket Balls for your army</em></p>

<ol>
<li>Take a lump of lead.</li>
<li>Heat it in a crucible until it melts.</li>
<li>Carefully pour the molten lead into a mould.</li>
<li>Wait until the lead has solidified.</li>
<li>Break open the mould and remove the lead ball.</li>
<li>File off any high spots or lumps</li>
<li>Check the ball for irregularities by rolling it down a slope.</li>
<li>Repeat the above 10,000 times - or more if you have a large army.</li>
</ol>

<p>This slow process was how musket balls were made until 1782 when a Bristol plumber had a strange dream. William Watts imagined that he saw raindrops forming into perfectly round spheres as they fell through the air. Wondering if molten lead would behave in the same way he conducted an experiment in which he poured molten lead through a sieve from the tower of his local church. It worked!</p>

<p>Encouraged by his success Watts experimented further, adding a three-story tower to his house and digging a shaft underneath to achieve a longer drop. Later in 1782 William Watts patented his process and made a fortune. Soon &#8220;Shot Towers&#8221; were being constructed all over the world, from Finland to Philadelphia, from Tasmania to Twickenham.  (Yes, we do have a shot tower of our own in Crane Park)</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2009/11/st_margarets_is_back_in_business.html">St Margarets is Back in Business</a></h3>

<p>Every available empty shop in St Margarets has been filled, thanks to the efforts of the St Margarets Traders Association and Richmond Council.</p>

<p>The Council has helped the organisation with funding for a number of schemes to raise awareness of the area. This has included match funded grants of &#163;4,000 to help pay for St Margarets branded shopping bags, a magazine and several events during the year, including the summer and Christmas fair, which takes place on Sunday, 6 December.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2009/11/the_marathon_de_sables_1st_april_2010_where_am_i_n.html">The Marathon de Sables: 1st April 2010. Where am I now?</a></h3>

<p>OK, is this an April fool&#8217;s joke? I will be leaving to do this mad run on the 1st of April and then starting the race on Easter Sunday.</p>

<p>It has been a few months since I have written about my training, but I&#8217;ve just been slowly increasing my mileage and working at my training programme. Some days are good and some are just bad. The hardest part is setting out on my silly long runs. At the weekend when I should have been at a race (doing 28 miles on Friday and then 28 on Saturday) I felt so bad that I hadn&#8217;t joined my friend as I had a cold that I went for  a 3 hours 40 minute run around Richmond Park and it was great! I think as I ran back to St Margarets, coughing and sounding like a goods train, I was probably running like Forest Gump, and I did have my head down so no one would recognise me. How could they? I was the only one running with a great big pack on my back covered in mud, so no one could see me!</p>

<p>Over the last few months I have been meeting up at Reigate Hill with my mad friend who&#8217;s doing the race. He is so mega fit, and whilst I&#8217;m trying to run up these inclines, my running becomes a walk because they are so steep. John runs by my side and tells me to plod up the hill (HOW?). However, my running becomes so slow that I&#8217;m quicker walking. I do catch him up eventually and we set off again. Finishing the run does feel so good.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2009/11/1st_st_margarets_beaver_scouts_seek_new_leader.html">1st St Margarets Beaver Scouts Seek New Leader!</a></h3>

<p><img src="https://stmargarets.london/images//BeaversLeaderSearch_thumb.jpg" width="150" height="84" alt="Leader?" align="right" style="padding: 2px; border: 1px solid #ccc;" /></p>

<p>The 1st St Margarets Scouts&#8217; Beaver Colony faces closure unless it can find a new leader by the end of December.</p>

<p>Current leader Simon Bliss, who responded to an article in last year&#8217;s local press is heading back to his native Australia and, with no replacement on the horizon, the Colony&#8217;s 14 year history will come to an end.</p>

<p>Aged 6 to 8, Beaver Scouts are the youngest members of the Scout association.  They progress to Cubs and then to becoming full Scouts at age 10.</p>

<p>Recent activities have included a Vikings project, Safety and Emergency Aid and a visit from an Army Major talking about Army life and his role in the Army.</p>

<p>Outgoing Beaver Leader Simon says &#8220;I will be sad to go and really hope this 30-strong Colony can go forward with a new leader.&#8221;</p>

<p>Anyone interested in finding out more about either role should contact Jo Kitson 020 8891 2110, email <a href="mailto:%4A%6F%68%61%6E%6E%61%5F%6B%69%74%73%6F%6E%40%68%6F%74%6D%61%69%6C%2E%63%6F%6D">Johanna_kitson@hotmail.com</a></p>
