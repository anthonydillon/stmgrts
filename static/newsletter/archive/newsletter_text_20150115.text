ï»¿THE HIGH BRICK WALL
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    If 200 years ago you happened to be a member of the landed gentry,
    with a prominent position in society and a shed full of money, the
    world was your oyster. If you wanted to cut down a few ancient
    trees to improve the view or move a main road because it got in the
    way you just got on and did it. Such autonomy was demonstrated
    by Sir William Cooper, the Chaplain-in-ordinary to King George 3rd.
    He lived in Isleworth House which still stands hidden behind a high
