<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2007/02/event_reminder_25.html">Event Reminder: Hamlet</a></h3>

<p><em>The Prince of Double Twists</em></p>

<p>It&#8217;s a thriller with all the ingredients &#8212; deliberate murder, accidental stabbings, romantic love and uncontrollable lust, plus wickedly black humour. Oh yes, and amongst all this excitement, possibly the most famous moments of poetry ever put on stage.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://stmgrts.org.uk/event/Play/200702250521">production</a> of Hamlet now in preparation at the <a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/directory/theatre/200506260340">Mary Wallace Theatre</a> promises to be one of the borough&#8217;s major theatrical events. Director David Duff has prudently cut the script to make sure the evening&#8217;s entertainment is short enough for people using public transport (~3 hours). For keen students of Shakespeare there is a special invitation to stay behind after Sunday&#8217;s performance and discuss the play with the actors and director who have been working together on the script since last year.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2007/02/strong_dog_foul.html">Strong Dog Fouling Enforcement Coming</a></h3>

<p>The Council will be adopting new dog fouling powers that will increase the maximum penalty for failing to remove dog faeces deposited on the highway to &#163;1000 on conviction. The Council will be targeting its enforcement operations at known hotspots in the vicinity of Primary schools.</p>

<p>New signage and publicity in the local newspapers will advertise this new power in the next couple of months. Leaflets will also be handed out to dog walkers and local residents in the vicinity of targeted enforcement areas. The Council will be offering those actually caught in the act of failing to remove faeces the opportunity of paying a fixed penalty notice of &#163;80. If the notice is not paid, legal proceedings will be issued. Such operations will be dependent on Council resources and the level of Police support that can be made available.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2007/02/hawk_in_moormea.html">Hawk in Moormead Park Threatens Small Birds</a></h3>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;I thought local &#8216;bird loving&#8217; residents may be interested to hear that a large hawk has been seen at the top of Sidney Road and also on Moormead Park.</p>

<p>I have spoken to a few residents that have thought squirrels may be to blame for the recent  significant reduction of small birds in the area, and this bird of prey may be the cause.</p>

<p>If the hawk decides to nest in the area, it could decimate the local bird community; especially, as it is large enough to take a cat or very small dog. I personally saw it catch a black song bird and its mate in one claw, but was unsuccesful in getting the bird to drop its prey. The bird stands approximately two feet high, and has a wingspan of over three feet.</p>

<p>The sighting has been reported to both the <span class="caps">RSPCA </span>and the local council.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><em>from Jonathan Blair, local resident</em></p>
