In addition to the developers&#8217; displays, there will be <a href="http://www.rivercentre.org.uk/#rcdetails">a display on the River Centre</a> : the projected building, its uses, and the work that&#8217;s already under way with local schools, groups and the community, to spread awareness and knowledge of the Thames and the area in which we live.</p>

<p>The exhibition will be held on the ground floor of the Civic Centre, Twickenham from Monday 9 March to Sunday 15 March (inclusive).

<p><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">FORCE </span></span></span>( <a href="http://www.force.org.uk/">Friends of the River Crane Environment</a> ) are delighted to announce that Crane Valley Park is one of the winners of the Mayor&#8217;s Priority Parks programme. We are very grateful to everyone who voted for Crane Valley Park - the response from local people, and particularly local schoolchildren, has been terrific. In fact we polled 6,677 votes which was the highest score for any of the parks across the whole of London. So a huge thank you goes out to all our members and their friends and families.</p>

<p>The award was formally announced to the press, radio and television by Boris Johnson himself in Crane Park this morning. The full results can be <a href="http://www.london.gov.uk/parksvote/results/">viewed online</a></p>

<p>The work now begins in earnest to use the award of &#163;400,000 to create a bigger and better park for all to enjoy.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/directory/sports/200903060340">Nordic Walking</a> evolved in the 1930&#8217;s by cross-country skiers who wanted to retain their fitness during the summer months.</p>

<p>Suitable for all abilities, this is an excellent activity and a great way to get fit. Supporting all the joints and burning 46% more calories than normal walking, toning the upper and lower body as you learn the technique. Each session lasts 90 minutes and all equipment supplied.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2009/03/update_on_a316_footbridge_at_st_margarets_roundabo.html">Update on <span class="caps">A316</span> Footbridge at St Margarets Roundabout</a></h3>

<blockquote><p>I met Tony Arbour and three TfL representatives at the <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">A316 </span></span></span>footbridge yesterday and can report the following:</p>


<ul>
<li>The bridge is 30 years old and one of four similar &#8216;temporary&#8217; structures on this stretch of the <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">A316.</span></span></span></li>
<li>It is inspected every six years, the last time being last summer.</li>
<li>As a result of concerns raised at the last inspection, a more detailed investigation was carried out in September last year, which it passed.</li>

<li>TfL acknowledges the bridge is in poor condition, but believes it is structurally safe.</li>
<li>TfL says the greatest risk to structure is traffic impact to piers. However, as the speed limit is below 50 mph, crash protection to the piers is in theory not required, but TfL will reconsider this.</li>
<li>The bridge is scheduled to be removed and refurbished in 2009/10 i.e. within the next 12 months.</li>
<li>This involves removing it for a period of around six weeks, shot-blasting, repainting and redecking - this has just been completed for the crossing at Hospital Bridge Road.</li>
<li>During the refurbishment, the pedestrian crossing lights at the roundabout will be re-phased to provide longer crossing times, at least during morning and afternoon.</li>
<li>The telephone number on the bridge for reporting defects has now been redirected so it gets answered.</li>
</ul>



<p>I confirm I am satisfied with the above arrangements and thank Tony for making the arrangements. Tony &#8212; the only additional thing to push TfL on is to try to ensure the work is undertaken this summer during the school holidays.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2009/03/spring_is_on_its_way_time_to_get_fit.html">Spring is on its way! Time to get fit!</a></h3>

<p>It&#8217;s still light in the evenings until 5.30 or 6pm. The mornings are also getting lighter. This means exercise should be easier to fit back into your life again.</p>

<p>Whether you just want to improve your fitness to run for a bus, play with your children, or be fitter skiing, make sure you start slowly and build up your exercise over the next few weeks. Here are a few simple tips to get you going:</p>


<ol>
<li>Set yourself a realistic goal that you can achieve and monitor.</li>
<li>Fit exercise into your daily life. Plan into your day when you can go for a walk, run or visit the gym. Do not cancel.</li>
<li>Focus on doing a good workout and have a plan of what you want to achieve in each session.</li>
<li>You can do a hard workout in 40/50 minutes by increasing the intensity of your session.</li>
<li>Do not increase your mileage by more than 10% per week as you could then be prone to injuries.</li>
<li>Invest in a good fitting pair of running shoes. These will prevent injury and will last you about 5-10 months depending on your mileage.</li>

<li>Train with a friend to keep yourself motivated.</li>
<li>Include some strength training and core work, like squats, lunges, plank and reverse curls in your plan. These exercises will help to improve your posture and strengthen your back.</li>
<li>You will feel rather stiff the day after exercise if you have not done much for a while. This is common and will go over the next few days. Try doing a little exercise, swim or stretch out as this will help alleviate your muscle soreness.</li>
<li>If you are trying to lose weight then never miss a meal and <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">ALWAYS </span></span></span>eat breakfast.</li>
<li>Remember exercise is fun and you will feel the benefits in a matter of weeks.</li>
</ol>



<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p>If you have any questions about exercise then email Georgie at <a href="mailto:%67%65%6F%72%67%69%65%40%72%75%6E%2E%75%6B%2E%6E%65%74">georgie@run.uk.net</a></p>


<p>Georgie runs run, her personal training business in St. Margarets. Bootcamps and early bird sessions will start in April. Visit <a href="http://www.run.uk.net/">www.run.uk.net</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Mr Richard Carter of Richmond Council Enforcement Team has been aware of the building work at 66 Crown Road without planning permission since January 09. He has visited the site and spoken to the landlord who has told him it is being changed into 8 separate bed sits without planning permission.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2009/03/the_meek_and_mild_murderer.html">The Meek and Mild Murderer</a></h3>

<p><img src="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/assets/images/2009/avershaw-thumb.jpg" width="99" height="150" alt="Jerry Avershaw" align="right" style="padding: 2px; border: 1px solid #ccc;" /></p>

<p>The 3<sup>rd</sup> August 1795 wasn&#8217;t a good day for meek and mild John Little from Kew. He was down to be hanged on Kennington Common Gallows with two other murderers - a notorious highwayman and a child killer The huge and bloodthirsty crowd of spectators that gathered couldn&#8217;t believe their luck. Three in a day!</p>

<p>John Little worked as a curator in the laboratory at Kew Observatory in the Old Deer Park at Richmond. This quiet and religious man had become a favourite of King George 3<sup>rd</sup> who he often attended on walks through the Observatory gardens. There was however another darker side to this apparently decent fellow. He had borrowed money from a friend, an elderly gentleman named McEvoy, who lived on the lane between Kew and Richmond. When Mr McEvoy suggested that it might be a good idea if the money was paid back John Little climbed into his house one night and beat him to death with a large stone. While he was there he also murdered McEvoy&#8217;s elderly housekeeper Sarah King in similar fashion. The cries of distress roused the neighbours who called the constable.  Instead of making an escape while he had the chance, John Little hid himself in a chimney of the house where he was soon found and brought to justice. It was later suggested that John Little might have been involved in the murder of a man called Stroud whose body was found under an iron vice in the Octagon Room at Kew Observatory, proving that you never can tell with people!</p>
