<blockquote><p>&#8216;Go tell the Spartans, thou that passeth by,<br />
That faithful to their precepts, here we lie&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p><cite>Simonides of Ceos (556-468 BC)</cite></p>

<p>Last weekend we marked Armistice Day and that moment at the end of the 1<sup>st</sup> World War when the guns finally stopped. The 11<sup>th</sup> hour of the 11<sup>th</sup> day of the 11<sup>th</sup> month, 1918. Sergeant-Major Richard Tobin of &#8216;Hood Battalion, Royal Naval Division&#8217; recalled the day&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Armistice came, the day we dreamed off. The guns stopped, the fighting stopped. Four years of noise and bangs ended in silence. The killings had stopped.</p>

<p>We were stunned. I had been out there since 1914. I should have been happy. I was sad. I thought of the slaughter, the hardships, the waste and the friends I had lost.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><img src="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/cgi-bin/poll.cgi?pollname=FILM&amp;action=image" align="right" /></p>

<p>Twickenham Film Studios have asked the council to consider removing the recycling bins from the council property adjacent to The Barons. The studios have decided that the bins are not suitable for outside their main reception area and request that they be moved as soon as possible. But where to? Do you have any suggestions as to where else in St Margarets that would make a good place for the recycling bins?</p>

<p><em>Twickenham Rowing Club welcomes new and aspiring rowers and coxes!</em></p>

<p>What better way to get fit than to join Twickenham Rowing Club where for less than it costs to join a gym you get coaching, a regularly updated training programme, peers with which to train and enjoy social evenings, and the opportunity to embrace your competitive spirit in all-round-the-year races.</p>

<p>We also seek coxswains for our boats - Coxes have the very important role of steering crews towards a Win, and to give instructions and commands about what needs to be done, motivate your rowers and finally coach from within the boat.</p>

<p>Twickenham Rowing Club is a welcoming open club and accepts people of all ages and abilities. We offer a number of different squads for experienced rowers and run regular courses for beginners of all ages.</p>

<p>Founded in 1860, Twickenham Rowing Club is one of the oldest and largest rowing clubs in London. Our unique position on London&#8217;s most beautiful stretch of the Thames makes Twickenham an idyllic place to row. As a pillar of the local community, Twickenham has a strong reputation as a friendly, sociable and welcoming club and caters for beginners and experienced rowers of all ages. The club is currently benefiting from sustained growth in membership. Our ever stronger senior squads cater for professionals with demanding careers who also want to race at Henley.</p>

<p>If you are interested in hearing more about what the club has to offer, meeting some of us or having a look around the clubhouse, please email Jacqui Johnston: <a href="mailto:%6D%61%6E%61%67%65%72%40%74%77%69%63%6B%65%6E%68%61%6D%72%63%2E%6E%65%74">manager@twickenhamrc.net</a></p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2011/11/beware_of_bogus_force_representative.html">Beware of Bogus Force Representative</a></h3>

<p>Heathfield Safer Neighbourhood Team have informed us that a man has been calling door to door in the Crane Park area,  claiming to be working on behalf of the Friends of the river Crane Environment (FORCE) and requesting bank details in order to set up direct debits to support a recovery fund for the River Crane.</p>

<p>We have no knowledge of this man or the scheme and it is not a method that we would ever adopt or support.    If you are approached please do not provide any personal information and inform the police by calling 101.</p>

<p>We are working with the Environment Agency, Thames Water and others to develop a response to the pollution incident on the River Crane and expect this to be fully funded by Thames Water.</p>

<p><span class="caps">FORCE </span>does run a membership scheme, details of this are available on our website</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2011/11/river_crane_pollution_update_10_november_2011.html">River Crane Pollution Update - 10 November 2011</a></h3>

<p>Rob Gray gave the <a href="http://www.force.org.uk/"><span class="caps">FORCE</span></a> AGM on 10<sup>th</sup> November 2011 the inside story: the cause was a jammed &#8216;penstock&#8217; (a sluice or floodgate for regulating the flow from a pent body of water, as in a watermill) at the point where two 2m sewage pipes join to become a single 3m pipe. It jammed after had been closed to allow Thames Water (TW) to inspect the 3m tunnel using a remote controlled camera on a &#8216;surf board&#8217;.</p>

<p>The TW engineers worked through the night to try to free it; it is lifted by a screw gear; when this sheared off they asked the Army if they could use explosives to free it. In the end they attached jacks to it somehow and jacked it up.</p>

<p>Before this the sewage had backed up into a hotel basement and was forecast to flood a much larger area when Heathrow woke and went to the loo en masse. So TW decided that they had no choice but to open an emergency gate and discharge it into the river; it would in any event have overflowed into the river before long.</p>

<p>TW have removed, they say, c. 10,000 dead fish which they have taken to Mogden so that the range of species (more than 20) and ages can be recorded.</p>

<p>The last time a London river was fouled like this was a discharge of bleach into the Wandle by TW a few years ago: they paid &pound;0.5 mn. into a trust fund to pay for the cost of bringing the river back to life. So it is expected that something similar will be agreed this time, before TW come to court in a year&#8217;s time or later.</p>
