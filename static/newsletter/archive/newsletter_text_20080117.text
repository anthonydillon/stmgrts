EVENT REMINDER: AN INSPECTOR CALLS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Three first-class first-timers take the stage at Twickenham's Mary
    Wallace Theatre this weekend -- in the classic J B Priestley
    thriller An Inspector Calls.

    This mystery-with-a-twist set in the Midlands city of Brumley
    just prior to World War I, marks the debut of new Richmond
    Shakespeare Society actors Keith Atkinson, Martin Elswood and
    Jonathan Dunn. Set in 1912, it begins as successful mill owner
    Arthur Birling and his family celebrate daughter Sheila's
    engagement to Gerald Croft, the son of a fellow industrialist.

    They are affluent, self absorbed and sure in the belief that
    nothing can disrupt their lives, till Inspector Goole,
    investigating the suicide of former Birling employee Eva Smith,
    arrives to interview them.

    They all claim to have had no hand in her demise. But under
    questioning they reveal uncomfortable facts showing the crucial
    part they each played in her life -- and death.

    Shows are at 7.45pm on Jan 19th, 21st, 22nd and 24th -26th,
    matinees 4pm Sun 20th and 3pm Sat 26th. Tickets L8 or L10, all
    performances now non-smoking.

CROSS ABOUT THE CROSSING - AN UPDATE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    I've just spent a very wet hour standing at the St Margarets
    Roundabout with two guys from Transport for London (TfL) Signals.
    I know a lot more about traffic lights than I did before.

    My gripe is specifically over the crossing on the North
    St Margarets side, on the Northbound side. Frequently, people
    turning left from the A316 don't see the crossing, or assume it
    is the Northbound filter light, and go straight through the
    crossing when the light is red.

    This is made worse by the fact that on one side of the road,
    the corner is completely blind, and so traffic can't see a
    person waiting to cross, which otherwise would trigger the
    thought that it might be a pedestrian crossing, what TfL called
    a problem with "intervisibility".

LOCAL WINE TASTING SESSIONS FOR 2008
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    We had a meeting of the St Margaret's Wine Growers Group shortly
    before Christmas and there has been a new development! Its remit
    has been expanded to become the St Margaret's Wine Appeciation
    Group. Activities now include local wine tasting sessions, in
    local residents' homes, led by local Master of Wine, Greg Sherwood.

    We are kicking off with our First Wine Tasting on Thursday
    17th January 2008 at 8pm - 10pm. It will be in my house
    in Sandycoombe Road, St Margaret's (5 minutes walk from the station).
    Greg will be presenting and discussing a selection of wines
    for us to taste. Cost for the evening is L10 payable at the door,
    to cover the wine and will include nibbles. If you would like
    to come, please contact me for details (see end of this email)
    so that I can estimate the numbers for catering and supplies
    of glasses.

    Greg Sherwood, 35, Master of Wine, is the general manager
    of fine wines for London wine merchant Handford Wines, owned
    by James Handford MW. A South African native, Greg now lives
    in St Margarets, Twickenham. Greg writes a regular column for
    wineanorak.com, an online wine magazine.

    Everyone is welcome, from complete novices to old hands. If the
    sessions go well we hope to stage them fortnightly and later
    in the year, to arrange visits to vineyards in the south-east.
    And don't worry we are not planning to focus on very expensive
    wines, there will be something for all budgets.

    Finally for would-be vine growers, if you are planting this year,
    you need to get your vine in by the end of March. I have prepared
    a leaflet describing the basics of growing vines, including
    suppliers. Please contact me if you would like a copy.
