CRANE VALLEY PARK WINS MAYOR'S PRIZE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    FORCE ( Friends of the River Crane Environment ) are delighted 
    to announce that Crane Valley Park is one of the winners 
    of the Mayor's Priority Parks programme. We are very grateful 
    to everyone who voted for Crane Valley Park - the response 
    from local people, and particularly local schoolchildren, has 
    been terrific. In fact we polled 6,677 votes which was the highest
    score for any of the parks across the whole of London. So a huge
    thank you goes out to all our members and their friends 
    and families.
    
    The award was formally announced to the press, radio and 
    television by Boris Johnson himself in Crane Park this morning.
    The full results can be viewed online
    
    The work now begins in earnest to use the award of L400,000
    to create a bigger and better park for all to enjoy.

 TRY NORDIC WALKING COMES TO RICHMOND
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Nordic Walking evolved in the 1930's by cross-country skiers who
    wanted to retain their fitness during the summer months.
    
    Suitable for all abilities, this is an excellent activity and a 
    great way to get fit. Supporting all the joints and burning 46%
    more calories than normal walking, toning the upper and lower 
    body as you learn the technique. Each session lasts 90 minutes
    and all equipment supplied.
    
    To book a taster session or a course please call qualified 
    instructor Beverley Boon at beverley@trynordic.co.uk or 
    call 07903 356 092.

UPDATE ON A316 FOOTBRIDGE AT ST MARGARETS ROUNDABOUT
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    I met Tony Arbour and three TfL representatives at the A316 
    footbridge yesterday and can report the following:
    
     - The bridge is 30 years old and one of four similar 
       'temporary' structures on this stretch of the A316.
     - It is inspected every six years, the last time being 
       last summer.
     - As a result of concerns raised at the last inspection, 
       a more detailed investigation was carried out in September
       last year, which it passed.
     - TfL acknowledges the bridge is in poor condition, but 
       believes it is structurally safe.
     - TfL says the greatest risk to structure is traffic impact
       to piers. However, as the speed limit is below 50 mph, 
       crash protection to the piers is in theory not required, but 
       TfL will reconsider this.
     - The bridge is scheduled to be removed and refurbished 
       in 2009/10 i.e. within the next 12 months.
     - This involves removing it for a period of around six weeks,
       shot-blasting, repainting and redecking - this has just been
       completed for the crossing at Hospital Bridge Road.
     - During the refurbishment, the pedestrian crossing lights 
       at the roundabout will be re-phased to provide longer 
       crossing times, at least during morning and afternoon.
     - The telephone number on the bridge for reporting defects 
       has now been redirected so it gets answered.

    I confirm I am satisfied with the above arrangements and thank
    Tony for making the arrangements. Tony -- the only additional
    thing to push TfL on is to try to ensure the work is undertaken 
    this summer during the school holidays.
    
    -- from Simon Fullalove, NSMRA

SPRING IS ON ITS WAY! TIME TO GET FIT!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    It's still light in the evenings until 5.30 or 6pm. The mornings 
    are also getting lighter. This means exercise should be easier 
    to fit back into your life again.
    
    Whether you just want to improve your fitness to run for a bus, 
    play with your children, or be fitter skiing, make sure you start 
    slowly and build up your exercise over the next few weeks. Here are
    a few simple tips to get you going:
    
     - Set yourself a realistic goal that you can achieve and monitor.
     - Fit exercise into your daily life. Plan into your day when you
       can go for a walk, run or visit the gym. Do not cancel.
     - Focus on doing a good workout and have a plan of what you want 
       to achieve in each session.
     - You can do a hard workout in 40/50 minutes by increasing 
       the intensity of your session.
     - Do not increase your mileage by more than 10% per week 
       as you could then be prone to injuries.
     - Invest in a good fitting pair of running shoes. These will 
       prevent injury and will last you about 5-10 months depending
       on your mileage.
     - Train with a friend to keep yourself motivated.
     - Include some strength training and core work, like squats, 
       lunges, plank and reverse curls in your plan. These exercises
       will help to improve your posture and strengthen your back.
     - You will feel rather stiff the day after exercise if you have
       not done much for a while. This is common and will go over
       the next few days. Try doing a little exercise, swim or 
       stretch out as this will help alleviate your muscle soreness.
     - If you are trying to lose weight then never miss a meal and
       ALWAYS eat breakfast.
     - Remember exercise is fun and you will feel the benefits
       in a matter of weeks.

    Enjoy!
    
    If you have any questions about exercise then email Georgie at georgie@run.uk.net
    
    Georgie runs run, her personal training business in St Margarets.
    Bootcamps and early bird sessions will start in April.

FORMER SURGERY AT 66 CROWN ROAD
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    _more details following on a previous article_

    Mr Richard Carter of Richmond Council Enforcement Team has been 
    aware of the building work at 66 Crown Road without planning 
    permission since January 09. He has visited the site and spoken
    to the landlord who has told him it is being changed into 8 
    separate bed sits without planning permission.
    
    No planning permission has been applied for and none has been 
    given however because they have told Mr Carter that they do intend 
    to apply for planning permission this week the council are not 
    currently taking any action at all.
    
    If you wish to register your views you can notify the enforcement
    team of a breach of planning permission online or you can email 
    envprotection@richmond.gov.uk or call Mr Carter directly 
    on 020 8891 7458.
    
    If you do register your opinion with the council you will be 
    automatically notified by them of any application for planning 
    permission should one be made.

    diesel engines.)

THE MEEK AND MILD MURDERER
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The 3rd August 1795 wasn't a good day for meek and mild John 
    Little from Kew. He was down to be hanged on Kennington Common 
    Gallows with two other murderers - a notorious highwayman and 
    a child killer The huge and bloodthirsty crowd of spectators
    that gathered couldn't believe their luck. Three in a day!
    
    John Little worked as a curator in the laboratory at Kew Observatory 
    in the Old Deer Park at Richmond. This quiet and religious man had
    become a favourite of King George 3rd who he often attended on walks
    through the Observatory gardens. There was however another darker 
    side to this apparently decent fellow. He had borrowed money 
    from a friend, an elderly gentleman named McEvoy, who lived 
    on the lane between Kew and Richmond. When Mr McEvoy suggested 
    that it might be a good idea if the money was paid back John Little
    climbed into his house one night and beat him to death with a large
    stone. While he was there he also murdered McEvoy's elderly 
    housekeeper Sarah King in similar fashion. The cries of distress 
    roused the neighbours who called the constable.  Instead of making
    an escape while he had the chance, John Little hid himself 
    in a chimney of the house where he was soon found and brought
    to justice. It was later suggested that John Little might have 
    been involved in the murder of a man called Stroud whose body was
    found under an iron vice in the Octagon Room at Kew Observatory,
    proving that you never can tell with people!
