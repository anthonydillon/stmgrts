A ROCK 'N' ROLL ROMANCE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    "It had come to pass, that afternoon, that Miss Morleena Kenwigs 
     had  received an invitation to repair next day, per steamer
     from Westminster Bridge, unto the Eel-pie Island at Twickenham: 
     there to make merry upon a cold collation, bottled beer, shrub, 
     and shrimps, and to dance in the open air to the music 
     of a locomotive band ..."
     
     Charles Dickens "Nicholas Nickleby" 1839
     
     
     For centuries people have been coming to Eel Pie Island 
     in Twickenham to enjoy a good time. The 1635 map of the island
     shows a plot of land as "hath bin A Boulding Alley". By the 
     following century a popular public house had appeared. During 
     Victorian times trippers would arrive by steamer to enjoy picnics
     under the willows and during the 1920's flappers and their beaux
     would row across to cut a rug at the Eel Pie Hotel. By the late
     1950's the flappers had been replaced by duffel coated ravers
     and their 'chicks' who crowded across the newly opened footbridge
     to stomp the night away to jazz legends like Ken Colyer and the
     Crane River Jazzband. By the 1960's the jazzers had been replaced 
     by rising rhythm and blues stars like the Rolling Stones, the Who
     and the Yardbirds. When the hotel burnt down in 1971 Eel Pie 
     Island fell off the "Must Visit" list and slowly slipped 
     into suburban slumber... until now!
