I TOLD BOB DYLAN HE WAS DEAD
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    In the summer of 1969 I told Bob Dylan he was dead. He hadn't
    heard the news at the time but he didn't appear to be
    too bothered. Perhaps, like the rest of us who had made it through 
    the Sixties, Bob had become inured to rock deaths - including his
    own. Since Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper had died
    in that plane crash in February 1959 a whole gang of rockers had 
    joined the great tour bus in the sky - Eddie Cochran, Otis Redding,
    the Bar-Kays, Brian Jones, Johnny Kidd, Sam Cooke, Bobby Fuller, 
    Johnny Burnette, Joe Meek, Frankie Lymon and countless others. 
    There was one major difference however. They really were dead and
    Bob Dylan wasn't but it didn't matter. The story going round 
    in the summer of '69 said he was and the rumour carried just 
    enough fact to make it seem plausible.

RECIPE: SPICY TURKEY JAMBALAYA
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    We are adding back a feature we attempted to start back 
    in August 2005, a regular recipe.  Here is one perfect 
    for your Christmas leftovers.
    
      "Christmas is soon approaching and many of us will be
       sitting down in a little less than a week to a huge 
       turkey dinner.  For the cooks in the family, the turkey
       dinner is a true feat of ability.  Trying to get the 
       turkey nicely browned, the sprouts perfectly cooked, 
       the potatoes roasted to crispiness, all while keeping
       the in-laws and children at bay, truly requires immense
       planning and timing abilities and tests the skill 
       of even the most talented chef.  It's no wonder then
       that after Christmas dinner is over, the cook is
       exhausted and ready to throw the turkey some place
       where it will never been seen again!  Don't do it! 
       There are so many brilliant ways of using those turkey
       leftovers that aren't just boring sandwiches and 
       microwaved leftovers.  My absolute favourite way 
       of using turkey leftovers is to make a hearty 
       jambalaya full of spices and vegetables."

NEW WEBSITE FOR THE GOOD WINE SHOP
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Good Wine Shop is an Independent Wine Merchant based 
    in St Margarets, south west London. Since 1999 we have built 
    a reputation locally for sourcing interesting, good value and
    often quirky wines from some of the worlds best small producers.
    Big high street brands and supermarket wines aren't really our 
    thing, however that doesn't mean we only sell expensive wine. 
    There are wines in our range for all budgets but quality is
    never sacrificed.
    
    Having managed to successfully establish our business locally we
    wanted to spread our wings onto the internet and see if wine 
    lovers further a field would respond as well to the range 
    of wines as our local customers do. We personally select all
    of the wines offered, a number of which we ship direct from the 
    cellar door in Europe. Our aim is to offer the same service and
    personal touch to a wider audience in the UK via the internet.
    
    Have a browse through our collection of Christmas cases & wines
    or simply use our wine search to narrow the options. We're sure 
    you'll be able to find something that hits the spot!

THANK YOU FOR THE CHRISTMAS FAIR
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Congratulations and thanks to all those who helped organise and

    of people where able to enjoy the night.
    
    Thank you!

EVENT REMINDER: HARVEY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Veta Louise and her daughter Myrtle Mae have arranged an afternoon 
    party -- hoping to find an an ideal husband for Myrtle. But things
    go horribly wrong when Uncle Elwood P Dowd drops in with his best
    friend Harvey -- a 6' 1" white rabbit invisible to everyone else.
    
    And as their party plans go progressively down the rabbit hole, 
    the baffled family resolves to commit Uncle Elwood to the local
    mental hospital.
    
    Come to the Richmond Shakespeare Society's Mary Wallace Theatre,
    Twickenham for a madcap masterpiece of merriment and mayhem as 
    Elwood and his bunny chum dispel the despair of the credit crunch
    in this beautifully written play by Mary Chase.
    
    And, on the way, teach us a thing or two about Life...
    
    Director John Gilbert says: "The play works best in the period 
    in which it's written, so we're conjuring up a world that hints 
    at but doesn't precisely copy late 1940s America, with references 
    to the film culture so vital at that time.To do this we're working
    with students from the London College of Fashion on some 
    marvellous makeup to go with the wonderful costumes.
    
      "In 1950 Harvey became a memorable film starring James 
       Stewart. As Elwood shares his ... well, idiosyncratic 
       outlook, its Pulitzer Prize credentials still sparkle 
       through just as superbly. We expect it to become this 
       year's top pre-Christmas present, and given its likely 
       popularity, we'll be performing 10 shows rather than
       our usual eight."

    Harvey runs from December 12th to 20th at 7.45pm (Sun 14th 4pm,
    matinees Sats 13th & 20th 3pm, no show Weds 17th). 
    Box office 020 8744 0547 for bookings, membership 
    and more details.
