ï»¿GREAT ANNUAL STREET SALE - 10 SEPTEMBER 2011 - IT'S A GUARANTEED GASS!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    There are times when the stuff that we accumulate around ourselves
    threatens to take over our lives. Bookshelves groan under the
    weight of unread books and CD racks creak with forgotten records.
    Cupboards are stuffed with things that we don't even know we had
    and wardrobes are hung with clothes that went out of fashion when
    David Bowie abandoned the 3 inch stack heel for lounge suits. What
    can we do? There are 3 possible solutions:-

    1) Do nothing until the neighbours wonder, "Whatever happened
       to old so-and-so?" and our bodies are found buried under a 
       mountain of David Cassidy albums, Dan Brown books and rusting
       Swiss Fondue sets.
    2) Go out at midnight and stick it all into a neighbour's skip.
    3) Take it all to GASS and sell it.

CHARLIE SHORE'S CHILDREN'S REGATTA
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Saturday 17th September will start with the recreation of the
    Charlie Shore's Twickenham Boys' and Girls' Regatta, which was
    founded in 1894 and last held in 1958; it is hoped to be an annual
    event. The regatta competitors are boys and girls (ages 13-16). The
    event will be for 20 rowers from schools in the Borough.

    The Charlie Shore Regatta is sponsored by the Richmond
    Environmental Information Centre, with the Twickenham Rowing Club
    as its delivery partner. The 350m course will be from opposite the
    White Swan to the site of the original Charlie Shore boathouse,
    just below the Eel Pie Island footbridge.

    Heats will be two abreast using 'ER' boats, followed by a
    demonstration race using traditional two-man skiffs. The format
    of the race will be a knockout with a repecharge so every crew has
    at least two races. Races will commence at 10:00 and finish
    at 13:00, followed by a prize giving.

RHYTHM FORCE 2011
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    A musical showcase from the British Army's finest musicians
    featuring Rock, Pop, Soul, Jazz Big Band, Folk and Celtic
    music performances

    RHYTHM FORCE was launched in 2006 to showcase the Corps of Army
    Music's contemporary musical talent. The RFU has agreed to sponsor
    the highly popular event as part of the Great River Race and
    Twickenham Riverside Regatta Weekend on 17th and 18th September
    with two nights of concerts in Orleans Gardens on Saturday 17 &
    Sunday 18 Sept 6.45pm-10.45pm.

    The Corps is delighted to have this opportunity to continue
    to develop its contemporary music, rock and pop bands. They hope
    that their loyal fans will continue to support them until their
    return to traditional home Kneller Hall.

    Each night there will be three of the best army contemporary groups
    and a special guest group. Both concerts will finish with the
    superb Army Big Band.

    The concerts will maintain the picnic and party atmosphere
    inside the big riverside marquee. We do hope you will join us
    for what is sure to be two very special concerts on a special
    weekend in Twickenham.
