﻿ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    "I have done something! I have made a grand step! I have appeared
     before the public as an author, but..."

     - ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON Aged 13. Burlington Lodge Academy,
       Isleworth, Nov 1863

    He was in every respect a true Scot, born in Scotland of Scottish
    parents, with an education in one of Scotland's finest schools,
    Edinburgh Academy and a family lineage stretching back to the
    Balfour chiefs of Inchrye in Fife... but in 1863 13 year old Robert
    Louis Balfour Stevenson, who was later to write "Treasure Island",
    "Kidnapped" and "Strange Case of Dr Jeykyll and Mr Hyde" came
    to live briefly in Isleworth.

CALLING ALL DRUMMERS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    St Margarets' Elastic Band needs a drummer, percussionist/timpanist

    They need to have good reading skills and a set of drums/percussion
    and access to timpani would be useful too!

    The band has a busy schedule of events this year including a
    charity fund raising concert on April 15 (for the St Margarets'
    Fair), the Richmond May Fair, St Margarets' Fair in July and
    Remembrance Sunday in November and will be going to Fontainebleau
    again next year as part of the twinning/jumelage programme.

MEET UP AND TALK ABOUT ST MARGARETS - 24 FEBRUARY 2014 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Readers who are interested in what goes on in St Margarets are
    invited to join an informal, but structured gathering at St
    Margarets Tavern on Monday, from 6.30 to 8pm.

    A few locals have shown an interest in putting ideas forward
    for improving the local area. They want to hear from more local
    residents that want to be part of the conversation.

    In the future the group can look at different things,
    from organising events in the area, to informing local village
    plans. If you have an idea for improving the area, take it along.

    Details and the chance to register interest can be found
    here: http://meetu.ps/2bNQbK
