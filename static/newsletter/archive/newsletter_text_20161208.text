RIDING THE RUSTY HUSKY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    When I was a teenager I used to deliver newspapers in the
    countryside around the village of Welham Green in Hertfordshire.
    Because the delivery round was eight miles long Fred the newsagent
    allowed me to use his car - the "Rusty Husky" - a rather tired

    farmyards and fallen snow.
