EVENT REMINDER: THE LAKE TWINS AT TURNER'S HOUSE - 20 TO 24 AUGUST 2015
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    A new interpretation of JMW Turner as artist and architect

    The Lake Twins at Turner's House is an exciting new exhibition
    by the internationally exhibited, London-based artist twins Phoebe
    and Lydia Lake, who have gained acclaim from previous work
    at heritage sites.

    The artworks in graphite on paper explore the twins' interpretation
    of Turner's architectural intentions. Enticed by the symmetry of
    his design when they first visited Turner's House, the Twins have
    spent days working there, absorbing the atmosphere and referencing
    the Regency architecture in their unique style.

FROM KIDS COME FIRST - BREAKING UP IS HARD TO DO
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Whether we're divorcing, separating or 'consciously uncoupling',
    these days it seems far too many of us are experiencing the trauma
    and effects of a family breakdown!

    The end of an intimate, co-parenting relationship can often feel
    like 'splitting up' = 'splitting YOU' and you may notice that your
    children just can't seem to get enough of YOU? So why do you feel
    so 'halved'? Well, firstly, you're literally no longer one half of
    a 'double act' - you're now a single parent and that feels
    different emotionally. When we're in love and together, we adopt or
    absorb parts of the person we love. So, of course, when we break
    up we do feel diminished and possibly halved. It's as if we have
    lost parts of ourselves and feels like something is missing.
