﻿IS THERE A STAG BEETLE AT THE BOTTOM OF YOUR GARDEN?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Last Friday I was tidying up what I like to call my office - a.k.a
    the back bedroom - when I found, lurking in the wastepaper bin, a
    Stag Beetle giving me one of those "What are you staring at, pal?"
    looks. It was big - about the size of a large box of matches - and
    waving around a set of fearsome jaws. To be honest I was shocked,
    not just by its menacing appearance but also because I hadn't seen
    such a beast, indoors or outdoors for years. How did it get into
    the house and what was it doing in my waste paper bin? Following
    B.U.R.P - the Beetle Universal Rehousing Programme - I gently
    removed it to a pile of dead logs at the bottom of the garden and
    forgot all about it until a few days later when…

EVENT REMINDER: ST MARGARETS FAIR 2015
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Saturday, 11 July 2015 from 12 to 7.30pm in Moormead Park.

    On a spring evening in the late 70's after the Queen's Jubilee,
    over a drink at the Turks Head pub, a group of friends had the idea
    of creating an event on the nearby Moormead recreation ground which
    would provide a grand party for the local community, and at the
    same time raise money for various charities.

    The day was a huge success and so the St Margarets Fair became an
    annual event. More helpers were needed; the local schools became
    involved, more stallholders signed up, a Fair BBQ arrived and a
    five-a-side football tournament became a fixture.

    The Fair is now a much loved and looked forward to event for the St
    Margarets community, with 1000's of local residents attending every
    year. It's a true community event with a small group of local
    volunteers making up the Fair committee and an army of local
    residents and volunteers from local schools and businesses making
    it all happen on the day.

VIEW THETWICKENHAM ALIVE FILM FESTIVAL WINNING FILMS FOR 2015
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Film Festival is a community event created by Twickenham Alive
    in 2013 which brings together filmmakers from the London Borough
    of Richmond upon Thames and allows audiences to see types of films
    that they would not otherwise see. This is a very successful non
    profit making event which is appreciated by those who take part
    either as filmmakers or as members of the audience.

    Watch the winning films

SUCCESSFUL POETRY EVENT IN RICHMOND PARK
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    For over 300 years Richmond Park has inspired poetry and prose
    from writers such as James Thomson (writer of Rule Britannia),
    early 20th century novelist/naturalist W H Hudson, renowned 20th
    century essayist and poet Edward Thomas to Australian poet Rosemary
    Dobson and London punk poet Ian Dury.

    On 17th June, winner of the 2014 prestigious TS Eliot Award
    for poetry, David Harsent (who lives in Barnes), premiered a new
    poem dedicated to Richmond Park and its wildlife at an event
    in Pembroke Lodge to celebrate the restoration of Poets Corner
    in the Park.

EVENT REMINDER: RSS TAMING OF THE SHREW - 20 TO 25 JULY 2015
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Richmond Shakespeare Society (RSS) - one of the borough's
    longest-standing theatre companies - is staging The Taming of the
    Shrew by William Shakespeare from Monday 20th to Saturday 25th July
    at the Fountain Gardens, Twickenham Riverside.

    Colour and comedy are about to burst onto the tranquil Thameside
    setting of Twickenham's idyllic Fountain Gardens. Even the naked
    ladies have been tempted to crack a smile at the antics of this
    talented team of RSS players as they romp through Shakespeare's
    famous battle of the sexes. Set in the rollicking, riotous world
    of the circus ring, RSS's open air production of this much-loved
    comedy will be as bawdy and boisterous as a classic 'Carry On'.
