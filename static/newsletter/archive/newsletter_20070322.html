<p><em>22 March 2007</em></p>

<p>Welcome to the St Margarets Community Website Newsletter (<a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk">www.stmgrts.org.uk</a>). Each Thursday we will send you the latest news and events from the website.</p>


<h2>Latest News</h2>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2007/03/richmond_counci_4.html">Richmond Council&#39;s <span class="caps">CCTV</span> Parking &amp; Traffic Plans</a></h3>

<p><img src="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/cctv_car-thumb.jpg" width="150" height="112" alt="Cllr Trigg in the CCTV Smart Car" align="right" style="padding: 1px; border: 1px solid #ccc;"  /></p>

<p>St Margarets is about to get two new tools in fighting irresponsibly motorists.  the first is the two month trial of a new high-tech car fitted with a <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">CCTV </span></span></span>camera on a periscope.  The specially modified Smart car will target known hotspots, homing in on motorists parking on pavements and illegally parking around schools and pedestrian crossings.</p>

<p>It will also be called to enforce traffic and parking restrictions on rugby match days around Twickenham Stadium.  Motorists caught flouting the rules will be issued with a fixed penalty notice.  The cars are already being used by Westminster, Enfield, Camden and Islington Councils and have proved effective in improving pedestrian safety and reducing traffic accidents and congestion.</p>

<p>Councillor David Trigg, Cabinet Member for Traffic, Transport and Parking, said:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Indiscriminate parking around schools and pedestrian crossings is highly irresponsible and poses a real danger to pedestrians.</p>

<p>&#8220;This new technology will enable us to focus on problem areas quickly and efficiently, in a way that parking attendants are unable to do.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Additionally, the <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">CCTV </span></span></span>camera on the mast, next to <em>Broadway Stores</em> will become operational from 1<sup>st</sup> April for monitoring the Tesco loading bay area, resulting in increased issue of fixed penalty notice to any offending parkers.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2007/03/reader_appeal_r.html">Reader Appeal: Report Noisy Planes</a></h3>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;I would like to let the people of St Margarets know that if, like me, they get woken up at night by aircraft noises landing at Heathrow it is possible to send a complaint about it to <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">BAA </span></span></span>and Richmond council. Have a look at <a href="http://www.richmond.gov.uk/home/environment/pollution/noise_pollution/aircraft_noise/aircraft_noise_complaints.htm">this Council webpage</a> and email or call them to let them know that the noise of aeroplanes landing at 4 am wakes you up.  If nobody lets them know then they won&#8217;t write it in their reports and they<br />
will assume everything is <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">OK.</span></span></span>&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2007/03/positively_pila.html">Positively Pilates Classes Starting in St Margarets</a></h3>

<p>Beginner and intermediate Pilates classes are starting in St Margarets on Thursday evenings after Easter.</p>

<p>The classes are a great way to tone up and improve your posture through a series of relaxing exercises. The beginners classes are between 7.30 and 8.20 and the intermediate classes are between 8.30 and 9.20. Eight sessions are &#163;60.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you prefer one-to-one tuition, you can choose home personal Pilates training.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re interested in signing up or would like more information please email <a href="mailto:%69%6E%66%6F%40%70%6F%73%69%74%69%76%65%6C%79%2D%70%69%6C%61%74%65%73%2E%63%6F%2E%75%6B">info@positively-pilates.co.uk</a> , visit <a href="http://www.positively-pilates.co.uk/">www.positively-pilates.co.uk</a> or call 07855 451 722.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2007/03/reader_appeal_t.html">Reader Appeal: The Barons Road</a></h3>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;The road surface in The Barons is in very bad condition and is once again pock marked where the surface has been peeled off.  It dangerous for cylcists like myself.</p>

<p>The road has never been re-surfaced in over 15 years.  They patch it and the patches come off.  It looks horrible.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve asked Richmond Council a number of times to schedure a re-surface but they say &#39;&#8230; no money&#39;.</p>

<p>I have once again asked for their help.</p>

<p>Can I ask through your Newsletter that other Barons residents, who feel the same, please report the problem to Richmond Council?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
