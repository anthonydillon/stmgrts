THE TURNING OF THE TIDE - RICHMOND LOCK
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    When Richmond Lock and Weir and its footbridge were opened in 1894
    by the Duke and Duchess of York there were cheers and celebrations
    in St Margarets. Now they had a short cut to Richmond on their
    doorstep. (Twickenham Bridge would not be built for another
    39 years.)

    There were celebrations in Isleworth as well. They were cheering
    because they didn't have a short cut to Richmond on their doorstep.

    When the old London Bridge was demolished in 1832, with its 19
    cramped piers and protective palisades, it resulted in the tides
    on the Thames rising and falling far more rapidly than they had
    done before. With the bridge no longer holding the river back water
    levels at Teddington dropped by 30 inches. The river flowing
    through Twickenham and Richmond became a stream running between mud
    banks. For much of the time the upper river was unnavigable
    by anything but the smallest craft.

CELEBRATE ORLEANS INFANTS CENTENARY AT THE CROWN ROAD ST MARGARETS FAIR
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Orleans Infants School are hoping to raise funds at the fair to
    help with their refurbishment project. The school are producing a
    1911 themed programme and are looking for any local photographs
    of the era that could be included in their programme. If you can
    help please contact traders@mystmargarets.com and we'll pass your
    details on to the school.

GET IN THE MOOD FOR THE ST MARGARETS FAIR
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    This year we have a beautiful little comedy movie produced and
    donated by local film-maker Joel Byron
    (www.bigplusproductions.com). The film was shot on a mixture
    of retro Super 8mm film and 35mm Lomography photos taken from last
    year's 2010 Fair, and has managed to perfectly capture the essence
    of the event with a beautiful vintage feel to it.

FILM CAMPS THIS SUMMER FOR CHILDREN AT TWICKENHAM FILM STUDIOS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    It's that time of year again and while the paparazzi chase the
    stars at the Cannes Film Festival, here at Twickenham Film Studios
    we're busy getting ready for this year's Summer Film Camp. As
    for the studios themselves, Steven Spielberg has now left
    after completing filming of "Warhorse" but the studio crews are
    still working morning to night filming two series for BBC3.

    Here in Dreamcatcher Media's office, we're busy finalising some
    exciting plans for this year's Camp! As well as the usual mix
    of fascinating visits to working film and TV studios, we're
    planning on some special filming opportunities during the summer.

UPDATE: THE MINISTER OF CHANCE
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    For background information, read Have you heard THE MINISTER OF
    CHANCE yet?

    We wanted to let you know that Episode Two has just been released
    on 12th May - we had to delay it because of a very exciting
    development with iTunes. We couldn't originally sell via iTunes
    within their existing system - and it's such a brand new concept --
    but they've been watching us and are so impressed with 'the quality
    & innovation of our business model' that they've been looking
    for ways round their own system to make it possible to include us
    in their catalogue. That's taken a while to sort out but we are
    delighted to announce that people can now buy Episode One and Two
    as an mp3 from our site or via iTunes as they prefer.

    We have been overwhelmed by the critical response so far and truly
    appreciate your continued interest.

    Thank you.

NEW TWICKENHAM STATION PLANS PUBLISHED
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Solum have withdrawn their planning applications for a 165-unit
    development and a podium for it to rest on above the platforms.
    Instead they have submitted a new single bid (11/1443) for a
    115-unit development plus podium, which was published on May 11,
    2011. The usually-mandatory affordable housing has been cut out
    allowing a 1-floor height reduction.

    The piling work for the podium is scheduled for October (there are
    no rugby internationals this autumn) so Solum are looking for a
    quick go-ahead for this scheme, either from the Council or from an
    Inspector on appeal. So if you wish to comment or object you should
    do so quickly.

    The key document is the Planning Statement, the 6th item on the web
    page. Re Affordable housing, see pp. 11 - 13:

    '... no affordable housing . . this approach has been agreed by the
    council ... confidential financial assessment ...'

    It seems clear that this application has been agreed by officers
    in advance & is expected to sail through. What will residents'
    group TRAG-SOS have to say when they see what has been cooked up,
    I wonder?
