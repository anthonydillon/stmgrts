LATEST NEWS
===========================================================



INTRODUCING RICHMOND FREESHARE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Nigel Cannings, a local resident,  has started a local website 
    for people to share unused items.  He says, "I've got involved 
    with freesharing.org and agreed to put together a web template 
    for people to start their own FreeSharing groups.  As a result 
    of which, I am pleased to announce that I have started 
    Richmond's first FreeSharing group."
    
    What is FreeSharing?  It is like FreeCycle in the sense that it
    encourages people to donate unwanted items to other local people,
    rather than throw them away.
    
    The difference between FreeSharing and FreeCycle is that FreeCycle
    is a very structured and proscriptive organisation (you can't, 
    for example, say you are a FreeCycle group without approval, which 
    rather defeats the grass roots feel of the thing).  FreeSharing 
    is much looser, and is self-regulating.

TESCO CLOSED FOR REFURBISHMENT
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    But this shouldn't worry you...
    
    Without Tesco the good folk of St Margarets have the perfect 
    opportunity to rediscover the rest of the shops on the high street.
    We should be supporting our community and should remember it is the
    small independent traders that help keep our community alive.
    
    Here is a guide to your local shops selling food, so why not use 
    this opportunity to support your local community after all... 
    every little helps.
