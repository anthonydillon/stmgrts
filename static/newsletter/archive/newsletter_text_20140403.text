ï»¿DRESSING THE PRESS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    or how to titivate your 'Telegraph'

    When I was a boy I used to deliver newspapers to an aristocratic
    lady who was a cousin of the Queen Mother. She lived in a large
    Jacobean house in the middle of a country estate and had assorted
    staff, including a chauffeur and a butler ... but it was the butler
    what did it!

    Every morning, instead of sticking her newspapers, the 'Times', the
    'Telegraph' and the 'Sporting Life', through the Jacobean letter
    box I took them directly to the butler's pantry where he would
    prepare them for the lady and her guests. On occasions these would
    include the Queen Mother. The butler referred to his early morning
    ritual as 'Dressing the Press', which he considered an essential

A MESSAGE FROM RICHMOND POLICE - CON-WOMAN
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    We wanted to make you aware of a deeply worrying and unpleasant
    crime that is currently taking place in and around Richmond in
    order that you can be more aware and also alert your more
    vulnerable or elderly neighbours.

    Over the weekend there were 3 burglary artifice crimes and one 2
    weeks ago that was very similar. Burglary artifice is a particular
    type of burglary whereby a suspect knocks on a victims door and
    passes themselves off as a professional - ie. Fixing a water leak,
    bogus builder and is plausible enough to be let in and they then
    steal items from the house, often money , jewellery etc, or someone
    who is in trouble and needs assistance as in this case.
