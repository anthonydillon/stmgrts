NEW NOTICBOARD

    St Margarets finally has its own noticeboard, located opposite the
    St Margarets Tavern at the top of Crown Road.  It is for use by 
    all residents to give information about forthcoming, or results
    of past events. It will also carry details of Police, RFU and 
    Council events of interest but no commercial advertising. 
    
    Cllr Geoff Acton said, "we hope that all residents will find it
    a valuable addition to the St Margarets' street scene."

LENTEN PROJECT 2006
