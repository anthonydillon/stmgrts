LATEST NEWS
===========================================================



EVENT REMINDER: OPEN AIR BARD
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    See Shakespeare's madcap Comedy of Errors on the sunken lawn at 
    Twickenham's York House in the latest production from the Richmond
    Shakespeare Society, a perfect way to enjoy the fun and frolic 
    of Shakespeare's shortest comedy on a balmy summer's evening.
    
    The play, the Bard's shortest, and one of his most farcical, 
    tells of two sets of twins separated as babies by a shipwreck. 
    One pair ended up in Syracuse, the other in Ephesus where the 
    play is set.
    
    The classic tangle of Shakespearean mistaken identity which 
    follows risks turning to tragedy, but eventually all comes out 
    right, and a family reunion provides the happy ending that a 
    feel-good midsummer play demands.
    
    Tickets are already on sale from the box office on 020 8744 0547.
    Shows are at 7.45pm on Sunday July 1 to Saturday July 7, matinee 
    July 7 at 3pm, no show Wednesday July 4. Seating this year is 
    picnic style on the grass, so bring rugs, cushions or deckchair.
    
    Meanwhile tomorrow's stars have been treading the boards at the
    Mary Wallace with Stages in Time, a Youth Theatre roller-coaster
    ride through the history of theatre from the Commedia dell'Arte
    to the present day.
    
    Director Katie Abbott says: "We had scenes from The Importance
    of Being Earnest', Richard III, Oliver, and a mini Restoration
    comedy, and the talented and enthusiastic young cast worked
    really hard to bring them all to life."

PROTECT YOUR HOME
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    "Please will you remind everyone that although our area
     seems to be relatively crime-free there are still 
     criminals about looking for opportunities for easy
     pickings.
     
     On the night of June 27th a house in Park House Gardens
     was entered (through a front window that had not been 
     secured) whilst the occupants were asleep -- a particularly
     frightening experience if you wake up to the thief 
     actually removing stuff from the bedroom in which you 
     are sleeping!  Valuables, a laptop, money and keys were
     taken and the thief left through the front door.
     
     So don't be complacent, make sure all your windows and
     doors are locked securely and keep your keys out 
     of sight. Take all sensible precautions!
     
     If you need locks or security items do go and see the
     helpful and friendly staff at Cowley security at 146
     Colne Road Twickenham (phone 8894 1212) -- no this is 
     not my shop! I just know them to be a local, long 
     established, and very helpful small business."
     
    -- from reader, Lee Hearson

GUESS WHO PAYS THE HIGHEST COUNCIL TAX?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    "Richmond-upon-Thames has the highest average council tax bill
     in the country, sitting at L1,665 for 07/08, the highest 
     in Great Britain. This is 106 per cent higher than in 1997-98
     (L807)."
    
    "The average council tax bill has risen by L918 in South 
     Buckinghamshire during the last ten years from L714 in 
     1997-98 to L1,631 in 2007-08. The next biggest increases 
     have been in Kingston-upon-Thames (L895) and
     Richmond-upon-Thames (L857)."
    
    "At L1,665, it is more than two and a half times higher 
     than in Wandsworth."


    -- from mortgage introducer's article, Council tax 
       rising ahead of inflation

    Anyone surprised?

BT'S OVERSIZED PHONE ADVERTISING BOX
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    "[How has this] this godforsaken excrescence made 
     its appearance.  How in hell did BT get permission
     (do they need it?) to take over the pavement. The 
     previous box (hardly less obscene -- oh for the 
     return of the classic K6) was set further back, 
     took up less space..."
     
    -- Peter Moore
    
    Indeed.
    
    The Council did move the bike rack near it that made passing 
    with a push chair impossible, but how can BT be allowed to take
    up ~75% of the pavement?
