LATEST NEWS
===========================================================



BOOGIE BEFORE BEDTIME ... WITH THE POLICE!
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    If you missed the Boogie Before Bedtime last Friday night at 
    Winchester Hall next door to The Turk's Head, then you missed a 
    treat. Hopefully, this will be a regular event, because let's 
    face it, how often does anyone get the chance to get down and 
    boogie, anyway? And for free?
    
    Hosted by the Police Liaison Group, and supported by the 
    generosity of Twickenham Police and the Rugby Football Union, 
    the great and the good of St Margarets & North Twickenham Ward
    cast off all restraint and rocked to the best of DJ Martin 
    Peters' tunes. You'd have to go a long way to find that kind 
    of footwork and energy - and that's just the police we're 
    talking about...
    
    The other highlight of the evening - one that will be discussed 
    at supper tables all over the Ward for weeks to come - was the 
    high-octane display of Bhangra dancing put on by several pillars 
    of the community, plus the constabulary and the Council.
    
    Eat your hearts out, Bollywood -- you've nothing to compare!

RECYCLING REMINDER
----------------------------------------------------------------------

        "Just to remind local residents that not only can you 
         recycle your cans bottles paper etc. at both sites � near 
         St Margarets Station and in East Twickenham but there now 
         banks in these places for your cardboard.  If you want 
         to be even greener you can recycle your plastic (not just 
         plastic bottles but bags, toothpaste tubes, supermarket 
         food wrapping, crisp packets, cellophane in fact every 
         conceivable type of plastic) at the big Tesco in Isleworth,
         courtesy of Hounslow borough council! Our borough seems 
         a bit slow in getting plastic recycling going so until 
         they do this is an alternative but only when you have
         to shop there � not a special journey to do it!    And
         don't forget to use your green food waste bin, a vital 
         part of keeping our landfill to a minimum. If we dont its
         a certainty that taxes will rise to pay for our 
         unwillingness to embrace such measures."
         
         -- Lee Hearson

PLANNING PERMISSION SOUGHT FOR HAND CAR WASH ON A316
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The following has been highlighted by a local resident.
    
        "Can I draw residents attention to a planning 
         application which has been submitted to open 
         a hand car wash on the Chertsey Road (A316) 
         at the end of the parking area for the offices. 
         Details are on the link below - not sure if
         residents on the opposite of the Chertsey Road 
         have been informed but it involves building 
         an office and the erection of   large Perspex 
         shelter - not very pleasant to look at.  
         Residents have contacted ward councillors - 
         Cllr Philip Morgan has responded to state 
         that he will support resident's objections."
