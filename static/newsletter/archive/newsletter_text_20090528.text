CHILDREN'S WRITING COMPETITION LAUNCHED
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Children in the borough of Richmond are being asked to combine 
    literary flair with the goal of buying text books to support the 
    learning of slum children in Delhi, India.
    
    A teacher at St John the Baptist C of E School, Hampton Wick, 
    visited slums in Delhi last year and witnessed the poor provision
    of education and educational resources. In response, the school 
    have decided to run a writing competition, not only to create  
    funding to buy modern text books for those children who attend 
    school, but to raise awareness of the amazing work carried out 
    by ASHA, an Indian charity which works in some of Delhi's worst
    slums. Visit www.asha-india.org/educationsuccessstories.aspx 
    to read about the charity's work.
    
    The competition is open for children aged between 6-11 years old,
    who attend any of Richmond's state primary schools.
    
    Children are being asked to write a poem or a short piece 
    of prose, no longer than 500 words, on the theme, 'I Have a Dream'.
    To tell their story, children in Years 1 and 2 are being invited 
    to draw a story board of six frames with written captions. The fee
    of 3pounds per entry will go to ASHA.

TWICKENHAM FESTIVAL 2009
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Twickenham's annual Festival is this year filled with music, fun
    and action-packed events.  From 12th - 21st June a huge variety 
    of community activities will take place.  The first weekend kicks 
    off with:
    
    Friday 12th June, the now traditional Twickenham Festival Tug 
    of War, starting at 6pm on Church Street.  Don't miss the teams 
    showing their strength - come and cheer them on!  Alfresco Dining
    is available for those who have built up an appetite; finish your
    meal off with a little culture at either the Mary Wallace Theatre, 
    it has a Shakespeare performance to enjoy or at the Bearcat Comedy
    Club night, special guest still top secret!
    
    Saturday 13th June has something available to suit all tastes.  
    A few delicious samples at the Farmers Market, Holly Road could 
    start your day, where a special hog roast will be on offer.  Then,
    you can choose either to hot-foot it to the Riverside for the 
    Marriott Twickenham Dragon Boat Challenge, or if you have 
    pre-booked, you could be on your way to see the inside of Pope's 
    Grotto, Turners House or York House.
    
    Church Street will be bustling with a Local Craft Market, song,
    music, theatre and a Dog-Training Show.  Don't miss the Morris 
    Dancers performing or the "Mary Poppins" themed Fayre 
    at St Mary's Parish Church.

    Plans for the Family Fun Day are going well, Jason Bradbury and
    Amanda Holden have both recently agreed to attend.
    
    We do have a couple of spaces left in the St Margarets Got Talent 
    show though. We are looking for children or adults who would like 
    to take part in the contest.

CPZ RECOMMENDATION APPROVED
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    From the official record:

      "On 20th May the Council's Transport Consultative Group which 
       consists of members of both political parties and lay experts 
       advised the Cabinet Member for Transport and Parking to make 
       a decision to include Moor Mead and Sidney Roads and Cole Park 
       View in a further extension of the St Margarets South CPZ. 
       However the Group also advised the Cabinet Member to give 
       consideration to the inclusion of Kenley and Godstone Roads 
       in the Traffic Management Order to afford their residents 
       the opportunity to reconsider their position in the light 
       of this further extension. Therefore whilst advertisement 
       of the Traffic Order will include those roads the Council 
       in accordance with its policy and supported by your councillors
       will only implement controlled parking in them if there is 
       a majority in favour."

    The ward councillors will send a street letter to Godstone and 
    Kenley to clarify and dispel doubts.

TURING'S POISONED APPLE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
      "We can see only a short distance ahead but we can 
       see plenty there that needs to be done."


    The corporate logo of Apple computers is a rainbow-striped apple 
    with a single bite missing from it. For most people it is no more 
    than the bright emblem of a successful modern company. For others 
    with longer memories it is a poignant tribute to a remarkable man 
    who lived for a short period of his life in Hampton.
    
    Alan Turing was the second son of Julius Mathison Turing and his 
    wife Sara. He was born at 2 Warrington Crescent in Maida Vale 
    on 23 June 1912. Because his father worked as a civil servant 
    in India, Alan and his older brother John were brought up by family
    friends and relatives in England.
