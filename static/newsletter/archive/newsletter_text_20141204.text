ï»¿EVENT REMINDER: CROWN ROAD CHRISTMAS FAIR - 7 DECEMBER 2014
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Come down from 11am to 4pm! There'll be the usual diverse mix
    of stalls, food vendors, children's entertainment, fairground rides
    and attractions, real-life reindeer with a very special jolly
    visitor from the North Pole who'll be ready to hear your Christmas

SOME STUFF THAT YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW ABOUT CHRISTMAS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Tongue tied at the Staff Party? Unable to respond when the kids say
    they're bored? Want to impress that certain passenger on the 8.15am
    from St Margarets? Why not astound everyone with your esoteric
    knowledge of Christmas trivia? Guaranteed to break the ice
    at parties!

    The first literary conception of 'Santa Claus' came in 1835 when
    the German poet Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben introduced
    'Weihnachtsmann' in his poem 'Morgen kommt der Weihnachtsmann'...

    "Tomorrow Santa's coming,
     Coming with his gifts.
     Drum, pipes and gun,
     Flag and saber and still more."

LOCAL ARTIST SETS OFF IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF TURNER
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    I will be setting off around the east and south coasts of England
    in Spring 2015 to paint at the locations chosen by Turner for his
    Ports and Harbours of England series. This will take me
    from Yorkshire to Cornwall in 15 steps, stopping at the some of the
    most famous towns in English maritime history.

LOCAL AUTHOR DONATES BOOK PROFITS TO EBOLA CRISIS APPEAL
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Buy someone you love 'Heaven and Earth' and help the Ebola
    Crisis Appeal

    Heaven and Earth by Guido Casale is a novel about sisterhood in its
    many guises, about how social reality appears to a 25 years old
    activist called Sarah and to her artistically gifted sibling,
    Donna. The sisters, each very different in temperament, have been
    orphaned and are trying to adapt to the practicalities of life
    without parents. When Sarah receives a parcel containing her
    father's private journals, the subsequent decoding of the text
    together with the search for the anonymous sender delivers the
    young women into a world far more dangerous than they could
    have imagined.
