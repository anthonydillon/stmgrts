ï»¿THE 70 YEAR OLD CHRISTMAS CAKE  - DECEMBER 1942
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Imagine. Britain is at war. Rommel's Afrika Korps have been
    defeated at El Alamein, the Russians have encircled Hitler's 6th
    Army outside Stalingrad and on the Home Front, Santa is about
    to make his expected appearance. Restricted by strict food
    rationing your challenge is to bake a small Christmas cake, covered
    in marzipan and seasonally decorated. You are to do it without any
    of the following ingredients... eggs, brandy, candied peel, nutmeg,
    almonds, glace cherries, zest of orange or lemon, brown sugar,
    icing sugar, currants, sultanas, raisins, unsalted butter, marzipan
    or anything else suggested by Delia.

    Please note: You may be baking this cake in the middle of an
    air raid.

LOCAL AUTHOR PUBLISHES CHILDREN'S BOOK, 'THE KEWTEES'
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    The first kids book to be set in Kew Gardens

    Colin Hines was taken to Kew as a child and in turn he and his wife
    Ann took their daughter Clare and son Pip there countless times. In
    an effort to encourage more parents to take their kids to this
    local wonderland he has published 'The Kewtees' in which these
    tiny, plump and camourflage green creatures find themselves
    uprooted from their forest home and they hope from their deadly
    enemies, the cruel Vampees. The Kewtees have to travel far and
    overcome many dangers before they reach the safety of the Temperate
    Greenhouse at Kew Gardens. Led by the resourceful Aunt Rosa and
    helped by young Petal and Bud, the Kewtees plan to start a new life
    there, away from the dangers posed by the Vampees. But will that
    be possible?

    The Kewtees costs just 7.99. It has 40 pages with 20 beautifully
    detailed colour illustrations by John Hilder. pounds

    Colin Hines is also author of Art Deco London
