CRICKET ON THAMES
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    When the old London Bridge was demolished in 1832, with its 19
    cramped piers and protective palisades, it resulted in the tides
    on the Thames rising and falling far more rapidly than they had
    done before. With the old bridge no longer holding the river back
    water levels at Teddington dropped by 30 inches. The river flowing
    through Twickenham and Richmond became a stream running between mud
    banks. For much of the time the upper river was unnavigable
    by anything but the smallest craft.

    It is hard to imagine but there once was a time when the main
    concern in St Margarets wasn't about swollen rivers and tidal
    surges but the direct opposite - a river so dry that it was
    possible to cross it dry-shod, a river so dry that people played
    cricket and enjoyed champagne suppers in the middle of it...

HULABOP CLASSES?  YES HULABOP
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hulabop is a new class on a mission to teach hoop dance to anyone
    who wants a fun way to get fit.

    In fact, you'll be having so much fun learning to hula hoop that
    you won't even notice the calories you are burning.

    Hooping is growing fast as celebrities catch on to the benefits.
    Michelle Obama, Beyonce, Kelly Osbourne, Grace Jones and Kelly
    Brook are all converts to the hoop.

ORLEANS HOUSE WINS HERITAGE LOTTERY FUND SUPPORT
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Orleans House Gallery in Twickenham has received initial support
    from the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) for the Transforming Orleans
    House project. The 3.2m pound project aims to preserve and make
    accessible the important heritage assets that comprise the Orleans
    House Gallery site, including restoring the grade one listed
    Octagon Room and increase public access to the Richmond upon Thames
    Borough Art Collection.

    Development funding of 235,050 pounds has been awarded to help 
    Orleans House Gallery progress their plans for a stage 2 application
    by the end of 2014. 

    The project will restore the stunning James Gibbs designed Octagon
    Room; restore the North wing, a former service wing, closer to its
    original appearance; introduce a Study Room showcasing works
    from the Richmond upon Thames Borough Art Collection; increase the
    size of the picture store; and make the upper levels accessible
    for the first time through the introduction of a lift.

AGE RICHMOND'S NEW PREMIER HOUSEKEEPING SERVICE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    At Age UK Richmond we work with 1,000's of older people every year.
    We have a wealth of in-house specialisms and are the experts
    in understanding our client's needs. For example, we know that a
    percentage of people face extreme difficulties in looking
    after their home, going out to the shops, having someone to talk
    to or indeed having someone to accompany them on visits to meet
    up with an old friend.

    Without this help, we find that our clients do cope, but, their
    quality of life is not as good as it could be. It is also very
    difficult to find a reliable service which offers this help and we
    hear stories of great struggles to find someone reliable to help
    them in their home.

    For this reason we are starting a new 'Premier Housekeeping
    Service'. It is a service which will offer not just help in the
    home but will also offer a valuable package of in depth support,
    access to all our specialised services and help to improve quality
    of life.
