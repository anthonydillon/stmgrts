THE BRIDGE AT RAILSHEAD
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    "Let every man praise the bridge that carries him over"
    
     - ENGLISH PROVERB

    Once upon a time, long before St Margarets was even a twinkle in an
    estate agent's eye, a road ran through these parts from Twickenham
    to Isleworth alongside the Thames. When it reached the River Crane
    just outside Old Isleworth, at a place called Railshead, there was
    a footbridge for the use of travellers. 600 years on and the bridge
    at Railshead still stands, bigger and stronger than it ever was,
    but still serving its original purpose, to help travellers on their
    way. Without realising it the bridge has probably helped you on
    your way as well.
