LATEST NEWS
===========================================================



TAKE THE ST MARGARETS ALLIANCE SURVEY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The St Margarets Alliance is asking all residents to complete a
    survey as the first stage towards creating a Community Action Plan.
    The Survey asks residents to consider which aspects of their local
    environment, economy, or social well-being are most important
    to them and to prioritise the most important and urgent.

    Community Action Plans are central to the Sustainable Communities
    Act (SCA) of 2007, which aims to create a more local form
    of democracy.  The Plans are approved by the Secretary of State
    and funded from central government and community funds.  As such,
    Community Action Plans help communities to shape their economic,
    social and environmental well-being.

    The group is non party-political and its purpose is to coordinate a
    Community Action Plan for the area. St Margarets Alliance does not
    have a specific agenda for the St Margarets area: the results
    of the Survey will form the basis for the basis of all future
    initiatives.  The group's guiding principle is 'residents first'.

SWAP OUR SCHOOLS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Last week, the Council, in the shape of Matthew Paul, braved a
    packed hall of parents at St Stephen's, to explain the 2 form
    entry plans for Orleans and St Stephens.

    In brief, to solve issues around pupil capacity and catchment
    areas, the Council proposes to build 2 new classrooms, plus
    ancillary buildings, at St Stephen's and 5 new classrooms
    at Orleans.  Each school will then become a primary school,
    each with 2 forms serving Reception to Year 7.

    Objections centred around three areas.  First, how on earth do you
    squeeze 60 more children into St Stephen's, especially as Reception
    classrooms have to be bigger.  Second, how can you sensibly conduct
    building works on such a tiny site.  Third, and for many the most
    important, it will split the community.

    Speaking personally, if the proposals had been implemented 10 years
    ago, all three of my children would never have met their best
    friends, and we would have not met many of the people we know
    today.  Football at Moormead would be fraught with inter-school
    rivalry, if it survived in its current form at all.

    Yes, it can be a pain having to traipse from school to school.
    Done it, and patched up the scraped knees from the railway bridge
    as well.

    But do we want to see St Margarets split in two?  A lot of people
    work very hard for us to be seen as a homogeneous community, and
    not two villages separated by the A316.

PLANNING: DEVELOPER TRYING TO AVOID PROVIDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The following application has just been brought to my attention.

    Back last year application 08/0307/FUL was granted permission:

      "Redevelopment of the site to provide a 3-storey building
       comprising 17 private units (11 x 1-bedoom and 6 x 2-bedroom)
       and 10 affordable units (3 x 1-bedroom for shared ownership
       and 2 x 3-bedroom, 4 x 2-bedroom and 1 x 1-bedroom for social
       rent), basement parking for 20 vehicles and 27 cycle parking
       spaces, refuse and recycling storage and communal
       amenity space."

    Read the Council's notes:
    
    
    However there were a number of conditions attached, in particular U20861:
    
     "No development shall begin until details of schemes for the 
      provision of education, health, public realm, transport 
      infrastructure and affordable housing to meet the needs 
      of the development in accordance with the relevant policies
      of the Unitary Development Plan and the London Plan have 
      been submitted to an approved in writing by the local planning
      authority.  The schemes shall include a timetable for the
      provision to be made and shall be carried out in accordance
      with the approved details.
      
      REASON: to help off set the increased burden on local public 
      infrastructure resulting from this development and to comply 
      with the terms of the Council's adopted Planning 
      Obligations Strategy."

    The developers are now applying to have this removed.

THE MARATHON DE SABLES: ONE OF THE HARDEST RACES ON EARTH
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Why is this one of the hardest races on earth?
    
    The race was first run 26 years ago when Patrick Bauer ran his own
    race unsupported across 300km of the Sahara. He wanted others to 
    take part in a similar experience and set up the Marathon de Sables.
    Over 10,000 people have since run the race with over 800 competitors
    from around the world now racing each year. In the UK alone, there 
    is a waiting list of 2000 people to even get on the race. So I am 
    not alone in my madness to complete this challenge.
    
    The race itself covers 151 miles of desert in sections 
    of approximately 25, 34, 38, 82, 42, 22 km and this is run over
    6 days (sometimes 7 if you do not finish the double marathon 
    in the two days allowed). In addition to running one must carry 
    all their equipment with them to survive for the duration of the
    race (so this is clothing, food, emergency medical kit, torch, 
    compass, cooking equipment etc.) Water is rationed and handed out
    at each check point.
    
    The temperatures mid day could reach 120 F degrees and the terrain
    will vary from rocks to sand with about 15-20% being run 
    on sand dunes.

THE BEST EVER ST MARGARETS COMMUNITY EVENT
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    What a lovely sunny day, Crown Road closed to traffic and a great
    chance to walk along the street and look at the shops and stalls
    whilst  mingling  with friends and neighbours.
    
    At the top of the road Parvinu were lured out of the wine bar 
    basement to set up antique tables and chairs in the street offering
    prosecco and a comfy chair. Our local community police officers 
    had changed their shifts so that they could come and join 
    in meeting local residents and offering to mark mobile phones and
    bicycles. Zoran was serving his usual high class burgers and
    Sunshine and Ravioli were doing a great trade in hot dogs. The 
    crowds in the street were joined by Vincent Cable our local MP.
    
    Centre stage was the Has St Margarets got Talent Contest held 
    on the big stage donated by a local business man Gary Flynn 
    at London Network Scaffolding. Residents were queuing up to display 
    their talents from Tango dancing to street dancing and Irish dancing
    no shortage of singers and music from local bands. Chris from Rock
    and Fairy the new hairdressing salon seemed to feature in quite a 
    few of the bands!  The talent show was hosted by John Stapleton 
    and Lynn Faulds Wood. Amanda Holden was unable to attend at the 
    last minute and the crowd was not disappointed when Peter Davison 
    stepped in to help out.  Local star of TV's  Gadget show Jason
    Bradbury and Gail Porter kept the crowd entertained and if you
    missed Jason's amazing break dancing demo you really missed
    something spectacular.
    
    The event was intended to raise both money and awareness of bowel 
    cancer. Crown Road is the home of Lynn's  Bowel Cancer Campaign 
    and they said;
    
      "What an amazing day  -  great for raising awareness of the
       symptoms of bowel cancer and lots of money raised too - which
       will help us to save even more lives. A big thank you to 
       absolutely everyone involved especially Simon, Barry. Anita
       and Pete too for making all of our games"

    St Margarets is some times called the village by the estate agents 
    but it certainly felt like a great place to be on Sunday 14th June.

    and craftspeople, as well as some of the younger budding artists

GOVERNOR VACANCY - ORLEANS INFANT SCHOOL
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Governing Body of Orleans Infant School currently has a
    vacancy for a Community Governor.  Governors take a strategic role
    in guiding and supporting the school's work and encouraging
    further improvement.  The Governing Body meets twice every school
    term and governors are expected to attend as many meetings as
    possible, these meetings are generally held in the evening.
    In addition to these meetings most Governors will participate
    in at least one sub committee (normally held in school hours) and
    should be available to come into school and participate in general
    school activities on an infrequent basis.

    A school governor does not need to have any background
    in education or to have children at school.  The main criteria
    are a willingness to learn and a genuine commitment to giving time
    to the school.   Training for the role is provided by Richmond
    Borough. If you might be interested in joining the governors
    of Orleans Infant School, please contact us at
    info@orleans.richmond.sch.uk for further details of the role
    and application process.
