ï»¿TED TALKS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    As this is a very slow news week, unless you are Angelina Jolie
    spotting, a friend of St Margarets Community Website suggested we
    introduce TED Talks to everyone. TED is a nonprofit devoted to
    Ideas Worth Spreading. It started out in 1984 as a conference
    bringing together people from three worlds: Technology,
    Entertainment, Design but has now grown far beyond that with
    over 900 talks online. The talks are only 20 minutes and are all
    persuasive, fascinating, inspiring and informative.

PETITION: SAVE HEATHAM HOUSE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    An online petition to save Heatham House has been started and runs
    until 4th October 2011 and has been created because;

    "The Twickenham Area Action plan proposes that Heatham House and
     its grounds could be sold for residential or hotel use and the
     youth centre moved into new premises on the old royal mail sorting
     office site next door."

    The Friends of Heatham House are trying to prevent the Council
    moving the youth facility from Heatham House and are seeking 1,000
    signatures to force a full council debate on the subject.

    However, Council says;

    "There is no Council plan to remove a youth facility in Twickenham.
     There has been no Council decision to close Heatham House.

    This Council will retain permanently a key youth facility in
    central Twickenham that has access to a significant green area. Any
    suggestion otherwise is totally without foundation."

    Why not have your say?
