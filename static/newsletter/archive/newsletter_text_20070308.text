PLANNING PERMISSION REFUSED FOR HAND CAR WASH
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    On the 16th February 2007 the Richmond Council Planning Committee
    refused permission for a proposed hand car wash to be located near
    the Book Data building on the A316.
    
    The refusal was for five planning reasons:
    
      o  detrimental impact on the open character of the land
      o  traffic impact
      o  no flood risk assessment
      o  no groundwater and pollution protection plan
      o  no local wildlife impact assessment
