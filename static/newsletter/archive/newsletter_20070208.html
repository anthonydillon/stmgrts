<p><em>8 February 2007</em></p>

<p>Welcome to the St Margarets Community Website Newsletter (<a href="https://stmargarets.london">stmargarets.london</a>).  Each Thursday we will send you the latest news and events from the website.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2007/02/interview_andre.html">Interview: Andrea Hosfeld of Talk of the Table Cooking Classes</a></h3>

<p><img src="https://stmargarets.london/assets/images/2007/andrea-in-apron-thumb.jpg" width="112" height="150" alt="Andrea Hosfeld"  align="right" style="padding: 2px; border: 1px solid #ccc;"/></p>

<p><em>Andrea Hosfeld runs a small cooking school from her home in St Margarets.  Her company is called, <a href="https://stmargarets.london/directory/other/200611051608">Talk of the Table</a> and runs approximately two classes a month, but also will create special classes for groups and kids.</em></p>

<p><strong>Where did you get the idea for Talk of the Table?</strong></p>

<p>I come from a very large Italian American family.  My husband is English and when we moved to London I found myself missing home, particularly the experience of sharing good food and conversation around a table.  Cooking, for me, is more than just a skill.  It&#8217;s a way of creating a mood.  When people cook together they forget to be awkward.  They laugh a lot and don&#8217;t worry about making mistakes.  I wanted to offer a cooking experience that wasn&#8217;t about doing everything perfectly but about enjoying yourself and the company of other people.</p>

<p><strong>What sort of classes do you offer?</strong></p>

<p>I do all sorts of classes but mostly group ethnic classes at the moment.  I am a foodie through and through so I like to offer people the chance to experience new cultures.  I do regional Italian classes focusing on dishes from places like Tuscany, Sicily, Lombardy, and Rome.  I also offer Southeast Asian, Spanish, Mexican, and Greek classes.  The classes last for about 3 and a half hours.  I start off with an introduction of the place and review some of the traditional ingredients and then we move straight into the cooking.  We end by setting the table, lighting candles, and having a three course meal.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2007/02/event_reminder_22.html">Event Reminder: Everyman</a></h3>

<p><img src="https://stmargarets.london/images/events/everyman_thumb.jpg" width="128" height="184" alt="Everyman" align="right" style="padding: 2px; border: 1px solid #ccc;"/></p>

<p>God sends Death to call Everyman to account. Can he invite his friends and family to his Judgement Day? Where exactly did he leave his good deeds, long, long ago?</p>

<p><a href="https://stmargarets.london/event/Play/200702020348">Everyman</a> is an imaginative mediaeval morality play which straddles the centuries, and tells of the trials and tribulations facing anyone trying to make sense of life.</p>

<p>Director Gerald Baker says:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;The joy of theatre is that one minute you&#8217;re entertained by the songs and jokes of a traditional panto, and the next are confronted by questions as basic as What matters in life? Hopefully we provide that contrast, as our Christmas panto is followed by the rarely seen Everyman.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Shows at Twickenham&#8217;s Mary Wallace Theatre are on Thursday-Saturday, February 8th-10th at 7.45pm, plus a 3pm matinee on Saturday 10th.</p>
