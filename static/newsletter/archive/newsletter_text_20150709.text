LASHINGS OF GINGER BEER!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Of all the summer sounds of my suburban childhood - the spine
    tingling theme to "Dick Barton - Special Agent", the clack
    of leather against willow as the brylcreemed Denis Compton showed
    the rest of the world how to play cricket - the one I most clearly
    remember is the woman next door constantly asking me if I wanted a
    Ginger Beer Plant. "Do you want to make some ginger beer, ducks?"

EVENT REMINDER: FUN ART DAY IN JMW TURNER'S HOME - 12 JULY 2015
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Children's workshops, art demonstrations, exhibition and music are
    all included at 'the little draw', a fun family art day taking
    place at Turner's House on Sunday 12 July, with a programme
    of events from 12 noon to 6pm.

    This is rare opportunity to be creative in the very house that
    England's much-revered landscape painter, JMW Turner, designed
    as his country retreat and from where he sketched along the
    River Thames.

NEW LOCAL BUSINESS: ST MARGARETS PROPERTY PARTNERSHIP
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Introducing St Margarets Property Partnership, a uniquely
    personalised and community-driven estate agency, dedicated
    to offering the highest quality Sales and Lettings service to the
    residents of St Margarets.

    Why St Margarets Property Partnership

    As a local resident, I have established SMPP in response to the
    changing trends witnessed in over a decade of estate agency
    in south-west London. The result is a stripped-back,
    client-focussed service minus the jargon and aggressive sales
    targets, giving us room to really listen to our clients and in
    doing so combine the very best qualities of traditional and
    internet agents.
