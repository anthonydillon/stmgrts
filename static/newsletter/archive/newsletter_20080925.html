<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2008/09/event_reminder_a_starstudded_night_in_st_margarets.html">Event Reminder: A Star-Studded Night in St Margarets</a></h3>

<p><img src="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/assets/images/2008/="/images/events/Soul_Agents_thumb.JPG" width="150" height="112" alt="Soul Agents" align="right" style="padding: 2px; border: 1px solid #ccc;"/></p>


<p><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/cgi-bin/events.cgi?key=200705141943">A great night of music</a> is planned for Friday, 3<sup>rd</sup> October, at The Turks Head Winchester Hall; all in aid of a great local charity, <em>The Shooting Star Children&#8217;s Hospice</em>. It is the third such event and sees a terrific mix of bands playing during the evening. Headlining are The <strong>Soul Agents</strong>, who play irresistible authentic 60&#8217;s soul and are guaranteed to get the crowd dancing. They will be supported by <em>The BlueBeat Allstars</em> who are well known in the area for their irresistible Ska rhythms and were seen most recently at the St Margarets Fair. If that&#8217;s not enough two talented young bands, <strong>Stranger&#8217;s Gallery</strong> and <strong>Bad Taste</strong> will also perform!</p>

<p>You just make a contribution at the door and all the money raised goes direct to the charity who now need over &#163;2,000,000 a year just to keep going. They rely purely on donations. Doors Open at 7.30. Don&#8217;t miss a great night out for a good cause!</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2008/09/halloween_and_beyond_at_the_turks_head.html">Halloween and Beyond at The Turks&#39; Head</a></h3>

<p>Halloween night, Friday, 31<sup>st</sup> October, promises to be a really busy night at the pub, not least because we have the excellent Sugar T and the Swells playing (as they generally do on the last Friday of every month) but we also plan to decorate the pub and have the staff in fancy dress- they don&#8217;t usually need much encouragement.</p>

<p>On the Sunday after Halloween, November 2<sup>nd</sup>, we plan to open the Winchester hall for family dining, with a Halloween theme. We&#8217;ll decorate the hall and show 2 films on the big screen through the afternoon: &#8220;Wallace &amp; Gromit and the curse of the were rabbit&#8221; and &#8220;Casper&#8221;. There will also be a small indoor space for children to play and free gifts for children in fancy dress.</p>

<p>We have free live music in the bar every Friday night, coming up there is Andy Wilson on Oct 3rd, and the Reprobates on October 24<sup>th</sup>.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve also got Elvis back for the evening of Friday November 7<sup>th</sup>, once again this is free and in the main bar. We&#8217;re in the process of planning a pre-show menu to start the evening off.</p>

<p>Also coming soon, although we haven&#8217;t finalised details and dates yet is a regular (every 2 weeks) free entry night on a weeknight,in the Winchester Hall to Showcase a range of bands. I imagine it will be alot of new or young bands but all sorts will be welcome (apart from heavy metal).</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2008/09/the_poet_who_lost_his_head.html">The Poet Who Lost His Head</a></h3>

<p><img src="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/assets/images/2008/Alexander_Pope-thumb.jpg" width="119" height="150" alt="Alexander Pope" align="right" style="padding: 2px; border: 1px solid #ccc;"/></p>

<p>Alexander Pope is one of those poets that most of us have heard of but few of us have read&#8230; which is surprising considering that after Shakespeare and Tennyson he is the third most quoted writer in the English language. Pope was the man behind &#8220;A little learning is a dang&#8217;rous thing&#8221;  &#8220;To err is human, to forgive, divine&#8221;,  &#8220;Fools rush in where angels fear to tread&#8221; and &#8220;Hope springs eternal in the human breast&#8221;.</p>

<p>In 1719, having made a lot of money from his translation of Homer&#8217;s Illiad Pope moved to Twickenham with his elderly mother, his old nurse and a dog called &#8216;Bounce&#8217;. (In his lifetime Pope had many dogs and they were all called &#8216;Bounce&#8217; which demonstrates that he may have been a real hotshot with &#8216;iambic pentameters&#8217; but complete pants when it came to dogs&#8217; names!)</p>

<p>He built a stylish villa on Cross Deep with a tunnel under the road to his garden and a Grotto that he continued to improve for the rest of his life. Amongst its delights were rare minerals, marbles, alabasters, stalactites, mirrors and a &#8216;camera obscura&#8217;. Pope was said to have remarked that: &#8220;Were it to have nymphs as well - it would be complete in everything.&#8221;</p>
