LATEST NEWS
===========================================================



﻿PREVIEW OF NEW BRITISH COMEDY "BORROWED TIME"- 8 SEPTEMBER 2013
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    open-air cinema in the grounds of Strawberry Hill House

    Jules Bishop's feature debut is a precious rarity: an independent,
    low-budget British take on urban youth devoid of cliche or
    cynicism. It's a nuanced character study centred on the unlikely
    relationship between hapless young burglar Kevin (a remarkable Theo
    Barklem-Biggs) and his eccentric old curmudgeon of a victim Philip
    (Phil Davis). Bishop proves a deft judge of tone, striking a
    balance of wit and whimsy that only tips slightly into parody
    with Kevin's cartoonish tormenter, the drug-dealing Ninja Nigel
    (Warren Brown). Still, first time out, the writer/director looks a
    very exciting prospect.

    There is a chance to meet the actors, director and producers on the
    night and Strawberry Hill House will be open until 7.00 for tours
    as an added attraction.
