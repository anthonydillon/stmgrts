ï»¿EVENT REMINDER: ST MARGARETS FAIR - 12 JULY 2014
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Don't miss the highlight of the summer.

    A full programme of entertainment throughout the day, starting 
    with a popular children's '5-a-side' football tournament in the 
    morning on Moormead. During the afternoon there is a dog show
    on little Moormead across Hillview Road.
    
    The musical entertainment runs all afternoon on the stage, and we
    moved the stage further away from the tea tent to help separate the
    'rock' from the rolls. There are announcements, interviews and 
    music throughout the day from Radio West Middlesex.

ROCK AROUND THE EMBARGO - PART 2
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    "Where would we be without amplifiers?"

      -- JOHN LENNON, 17 June 1963

    By the early 1960's the British pop music scene was changing. The
    early rock 'n' roll stars with the fancy names like Marty, Billy,
    Tommy and Vince were falling from favour. Instead of screaming
    at solo singers with quiffs, attitude and gold lame suits fans were
    now turning their attention to the latest pop phenomenon, the beat
    groups, who were following on the Cuban heels of the Beatles. Often
    writing their own material and promoting their own regional
    'sounds' like Merseybeat and Brumbeat these guitar dominated groups
    were no longer limited to coffee bars and youth clubs.

MUSEUM FOR QUEEN'S BARGE GLORIANA SPARKS PROTEST IN RICHMOND
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Residents are furious at Tory Lord True's plans to build boat a
    home in river park and claim council was 'acting in secret'

    As the lead vessel in the Queen's diamond jubilee river pageant,
    she glistened with gold, flew the flags of the United Kingdom, and
    epitomised the pomp and circumstance of the occasion.

    The royal barge Gloriana, built in Richmond upon Thames especially
    for the jubilee and inspired by 18th-century barges painted by the
    Italian artist Canaletto, has been used in several ceremonies
    since her June 2012 debut, including the Olympics. But her next
    likely appearance - in an enormous dry dock in a new river park
    alongside the Thames in Twickenham - has led to an angry protest.

    The idea is the brainchild of Lord True, the Conservative leader
    of Richmond council, and involves 1m of public money to create a
    tourist and heritage site with Gloriana as its centre, as a tribute
    to the vessel, its Richmond connections, and to the Queen. pounds

    -- from The Guardian - 30 June 2014

COMMEMORATING THE FIRST WORLD WAR
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    To commemorate the Centenary of the First World War, a series
    of borough-wide events will be launched by Richmond Council
    throughout the year to mark the anniversary.

    The brochure 'Commemorating the first World War in Richmond
    upon Thames' has been launched by Richmond Council to give an
    overview of the activities taking place between July to December
    2014. It provides details of 9 exhibitions, and 42 events including
    commemorations, community events and learning programmes as well
    as key highlights for future years.
