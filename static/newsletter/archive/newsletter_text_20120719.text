ï»¿WET WEATHER CAMPING 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Top Tips and Helpful Hints from "Akela"

    "It always rains on tents. Rainstorms will travel thousands
     of miles, against prevailing winds for the opportunity to rain on
     a tent."

     -- DAVE BARRY- AMERICAN WRITER


    Any dreams we might have of an idyllic camping holiday under a
    warm, lazy summer sun have largely been washed away in the recent
    weather. But for all the inconvenience of relentless rain there is
    still plenty of fun to be had if you are suitably prepared...and
    there is nothing so soothing as lying in a tent, comfortable and
    warm, and listening to the gentle patter of rain on the roof above.

LOCAL FREE SCHOOL CAMPAIGN TO CONTINUE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The New Local School for Twickenham Steering Group says their
    campaign for a new parent-driven inclusive secondary free school
    will continue. Their proposal wasn't on the Department
    for Education's list of 100 Free Schools approved for opening
    in 2013, but they plan to resubmit their bid in the next round.

    "Our plan for an inspirational school, which strives for academic
    excellence and enables children from all backgrounds to make
    exceptional progress has caught local people's imagination, and
    generated fantastic levels of support" said Sarah Dietz, a
    life-long North Teddington resident and parent of children
    at Stanley Primary School. "We know we have a very strong proposal,
    with the capability and capacity to deliver. The local conditions
    weren't right for approval in this funding round, but we have every
    reason to believe that situation is temporary, and that we have a
    strong chance of success next time".
