ï»¿THE NEW STATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    ... or how we nearly came to be living in Ailsa Bridge.

    In the 1870's St Margarets had everything that any small self
    respecting Victorian suburb might wish for - some shops, a church
    or two and a pub if you needed one. Although the now familiar
    streets of two-ups and two-down 'villas' hadn't been built yet,
    there were still plenty of smart, well appointed houses on tree
    lined avenues to admire. St Margarets even had a railway line
    running out from London westwards towards Reading. There was only
    thing that it didn't have - a railway station... and this really
    ticked off the local populace...

PUBS FOR SALE: OLD ANCHOR AND MARBLE HILL
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Young & Co Brewery plc, who these days are in truth a pubco that no
    longer brews any beer, are trying to sell 14 pubs, including the
    Old Anchor and Marble Hill on Richmond Road. The Old Anchor's
    asking price is 650,000 pounds for the freehold (but it is let on a
    3-year lease until 2014 for 17000 pounds p.a.). Ominously the agents say
    'The building occupies a large plot and may be suitable
    for alternative uses, subject to planning permission.'

    The now shut Marble Hill (formerly the Rising Sun) is cheaper
    at 600,000 pounds with vacant possession. It has had a difficult time
    since its last proper landlord, Kevin Barker, left in disgust at
    the greedy rent rises demanded by Young's: as a neighbour, even
    though I am a pub-goer, I haven't used this one for years: I think
    its demise would pass unmourned, indeed unnoticed, by one and all.

    Also for sale is the Mitre in St Mary's Grove, Richmond, a pub that
    many residents don't know exists, at one time said to be the haunt
    of the local criminal fraternity, where a strange face was rarely
    seen, but now a 'Well-run traditional pub serving the local
    community in an affluent residential area. There is no
    commercial kitchen, so food is limited. Popular music venue.'

STARS JOIN CAMPAIGN TO SAVE FILM STUDIO
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Steven Spielberg, Sir Paul McCartney and Colin Firth are among the
    celebrities supporting a campaign to stop Twickenham Film
    Studios closing.

    The studios were used in blockbusters War Horse and The Iron Lady
    and were also used for the Beatles' films Help! and A Hard Day's
    Night. But the studios, which occupy a two-and-a-half acre site,
    have failed to make money for the past three years.

    So far resident Maria Walker has collected 3,769 signatures for her
    Save Twickenham Studios petition.

    Sir Paul said: "I have many fond memories of working at Twickenham
    Studios. It's a fine example of a British film studio and it would
    be a great loss if it were to have nothing more to do with the
    British film industry."

    Educating Rita actress Julie Walters has written to Business
    Secretary Vince Cable, who is the MP for Twickenham, appealing
    for him to step in.

    She said in her email to the minister: "The closing down of these
    studios will give Hollywood one message that the British film
    industry is struggling, when it is not."

    London MEP Mary Honeyball has appealed to the European Commission
    to help on the grounds that it is important to keep the production
    of major films in Europe.
