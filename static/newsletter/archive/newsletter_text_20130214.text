LATEST NEWS
===========================================================



ï»¿STOP PRESS: ISLEWORTH MONA LISA DECLARED AUTHENTIC!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    After exhaustive tests experts have just declared the so-called
    'Isleworth Mona Lisa' as Leonardo Da Vinci's original version of
    the famous 'Mona Lisa' now in the Louvre in Paris.

    David Feldman, vice-president of the Mona Lisa foundation, an
    international group set up to demonstrate the painting's
    authenticity said, "When we add these new findings to the wealth
    of scientific and physical studies we already have, I believe
    anyone will find the evidence of a Leonardo
    attribution overwhelming."

    Much of this new evidence was provided by Italian geometrist
    Alfonso Rubino. He had made extended studies of the geometry
    of Leonardo's 'Vitruvian Man'. When he compared his findings
    with the geometry of the 'Isleworth Mona Visa' he was convinced
    that both paintings were by the same artist.

    Carbon dating tests on the painting by the Federal Institute
    of Technology in Switzerland also confirmed that its canvas was
    almost certainly manufactured between 1410 and 1455, refuting
    claims that the painting was a late 16th century copy.

MISSING CAT: ROLO
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Rolo the cat went missing from Kilmorey Road, St Margarets on
    Monday 4th February 2013. He is an indoor cat and only 9 months old
    - He will be very scared and nervous. We are desperately worried
    about him.

    Please check your sheds/garages etc as he may be hiding somewhere.
    If you have seen him please contact me, even if just an email.

    For his safe return I am offering a 200 pound reward.

INCORRECT PARKING FINES AND POSSIBLE REPAYMENT
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Just some advice (not always understood by parking wardens) for St
    Margarets residents.

    Parking on a single yellow line is restricted by the small
    yellow/black road signs usually attached to a suitable lamp post or
    similar IN THE ROAD YOU PARK IN.

    This sign denotes the single yellow line time of operation.

    Some roads in St Margarets do not have these signs. In these roads
    parking time is by default the same as any residents slots in that
    road (usually 10am to 4.30 pm). For instance Norman Ave residents
    restrictions are 10.00 am to 16.30 hrs (from memory).

    As at today - there are no yellow line restriction notices in
    Norman Avenue. Therefore the single yellow line parking restriction
    in Norman ave is in effective between 10am and 4.30 pm. But do
    remember - the notice could be at the other end of the road - you
    need to check.

    If you have a fine and paid it - ticketed outside the residents
    parking time in these type of road - you may have grounds
    for re-payment.

    The real question is -

    Why can't our professional parking operators/office/staff know and
    implement their own rules in the first place instead of causing
    upset and demanding fines/payment before understanding their error?

    rgds, David Houston

DREAMCATCHER MEDIA'S FILM CAMP - APRIL 2013
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Well the excitement of the BAFTAs is now over, with Skyfall winning
    most outstanding film although its British director Sam Mendes
    bemoaned the fact that 007 himself, actor Daniel Craig didn't get a
    nomination. Javier Bardem worked equally hard at his brilliant
    portrayal of baddie Raoul Silva. Here at Dreamcatcher Media, the
    films made on our Easter and Summer Film Camps also feature great
    heroes and anti-heroes, goodies and baddies, exciting chases and
    dramatic scenes - all scripted, filmed and directed by young people
    aged 8 - 16.

    Our next 5 day Film Camp starts during the Easter break on 8th
    April. Participants come up with their own idea for a film, then
    set about shooting, directing and editing it over the five days
    under expert tuition from industry professionals. It's all great
    fun but good learning too and young wannabee filmmakers finish the
    course equipped to make their own movies.

    Sponsored by the Alpha Plus Group, the Camp takes place at Falcons
    Boys Prep School in Richmond and runs Monday to Friday 8th-13th
    April starting at 9am.

    For enquiries, please contact David O'Keeffe Tel: 07977 067576 or
    email davidok@dreamcatchermedia.co.uk.
