<p>Welcome to the St Margarets Community Website Newsletter (<a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk">www.stmgrts.org.uk</a>). Occasional Thursdays we will send you the latest news and events from the website.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2011/05/poison_gas_week.html">Poison Gas Week</a></h3>

<p>Early in May 1942, the third year of the war, people of Richmond were rather surprised when this leaflet from the mayor, E. A Collings, dropped through their letter box.</p>

<div class="letter">

<p><img src="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/assets/images/2011/POISON_Gas-Leaflet_thumb.gif" width="150" height="287" alt="Poison Gas leaflet"  align="right" style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 1px;" /></p>

<h4><span class="caps">POISON GAS WEEK</span></h4>

<p>Dear Sir or Madam,</p>

<p>During the period June 15<sup>th</sup> - June 20<sup>th</sup> it will be necessary upon one or two occasions to liberate in the streets of the Borough a form of War-gas&#8230;.</p>

<p>&#8230;it will cause extremely unpleasant symptoms if breathed without the protection of a respirator; and, since no warning will be given of the &#8220;surprise attack&#8221;, you will therefore required to have your gas-mask constantly with you.</p>

</div>

<p>This was the announcement of a week designed to raise public awareness of the dangers of an enemy attack with poison gas. Similar notices appeared on the front pages of the local newspapers with the warning&#8230;</p>

<h3><span class="caps">DANGER </span>- <span class="caps">THERE WILL</span> BE <span class="caps">SURPRISE POISON GAS ATTACKS</span> SO <span class="caps">CARRY YOUR GAS</span>-MASK - <span class="caps">ALWAYS</span></h3>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2011/05/racc_business_enterprise_and_networking_events.html"><span class="caps">RACC</span> Business, Enterprise and Networking events</a></h3>

<p>Following the first <span class="caps">RACC</span> Business Networking event held in February 2011 which featured presenters from the Chambers of Commerce and the local Council, we received numerous requests to provide similar opportunities which combine essential information needed by modern businesses with important networking opportunities.</p>

<p>Our second Business Networking event &#8220;From Bellman to Kindle&#8221; will focus on the essential information the modern communicator and networker needs to work effectively in business today. The host and facilitator for the night, William Freeman, will deliver this lively, interactive session which draws upon communications lessons learnt not only from the traditional town crier and bellman but also from the modern day magician and mentalist.</p>

<p>Last year, over 13,500 local people took the opportunity to have their say about their local areas through the survey run by Richmond Council. That represents 17% of households spread evenly across the borough.</p>

<p>First results from the survey, show that 92 per cent of local people have said they were happy with their local area &#8212; however they did highlight a number of areas that need improving.</p>

<p>We have now fully analysed all the results and are beginning to understand what<br />
people want for their local area and villages. To help with the next stage, the Council has organised a series of local area planning events across the borough over the next few months where people will be able to get together to decide what they want for their local area.</p>

<p>If you would like to have your say about the area where you live, please come along to your nearest event, which is on the <a href="http://stmgrts.org.uk/event/meeting/200705142790">11<sup>th</sup> June for Twickenham, St Margarets, East Twickenham and Strawberry Hill Villages in the Twickenham Civic Centre foyer from 10am to 4pm</a>.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2011/05/take_the_polices_public_access_survey.html">Take the Police&#39;s Public Access Survey</a></h3>

<p>The Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) has launched a review into the different ways in which the public can contact police and access our services. These range from telephone, online and face-to-face methods, including via police stations and appointments.</p>

<p>In these challenging financial times, it is essential that the <span class="caps">MPS </span>makes best use of available resources. This is one of the key aims of the review that will ensure we can deliver an efficient and cost effective service in the right place at the right time.</p>

<p>As part of the review, we have launched an anonymous online survey. We will use the results of the survey, which runs until 27<sup>th</sup> May 2011, to develop a strategy to maintain and enhance public access to policing services within a core minimum standard. No decisions have yet been made and any changes will only take place with the approval of the most senior officers and staff who form the <span class="caps">MPS</span> Management Board and the Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA), an independent governing body that holds the <span class="caps">MPS </span>to account.</p>

<p>To have your say and influence the future of local policing in your area please take ten minutes to complete this survey; your views are important to us and will help us improve our services to better meet your needs.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2011/05/obituary_mac_mcgann_local_musician_and_artist.html">Obituary: Mac McGann - Local Musician and Artist</a></h3>

<p><img src="http://www.independent.co.uk/multimedia/dynamic/00595/Pg-08-McGann-obi_595232t.jpg" width="150" alt="McGann from the Independant"  align="right" style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 1px;" /></p>


<blockquote><p>Michael &#8220;Mac&#8221; McGann was a folk singer and songwriter, a unique guitarist, barrelhouse blues pianist, harmonica player, graphic artist, wood carver and cartoonist. He was best-known for his live performances in pubs and clubs around London alongside guitarists and singers who would become more famous - including John Martyn, John Renbourn, Ralph McTell and the &#8220;King of the Buskers&#8221; Don Partridge. McGann co-founded several folk bands, including the Levee Breakers in the 1960s with the 12-string guitarist Johnny Joyce and singer Beverley Kutner (later to become Beverley Martyn). They were a breakthrough outfit who became a major influence on McTell and such folk groups as Pentangle, with Renbourn and Bert Jantsch, and later the Incredible String Band.</p>

<p>McTell, who would make his name with Streets of London, was inspired by McGann, whom he described as &#8220;truly in the vanguard of the singer/songwriter movement, long before the term was coined.&#8221; McGann played his unique, self-designed double-neck guitar on McTell&#8217;s early solo albums and on many tracks laid down by the popular &#8217;70s rock band McGuinness Flint.</p></blockquote>
