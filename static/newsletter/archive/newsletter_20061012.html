<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2006/10/fundraising_for.html">Fundraising for Motor Neurone Disease </a></h3>

<p><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/jonmason.html"></a></p>


<p>St Margarets Resident Jon Mason is planning on trekking to the top of Mount Kilimanjaro and raising money for the Motor Neurone Disease Association in the process.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Kilimanjaro has been on my &#39;must do&#39; list ever since a work trip to Kenya enabled me to view from a distance this hugely impressive Mountain. Standing at 5895m it is the highest peak in Africa and the tallest freestanding mountain in the world. Thankfully it can be conquered by walking rather than climbing, the dangers coming from altitude sickness and exposure. Statistics are varied and unreliable but less than half of the people who make the attempt actually reach the summit, and even in good conditions the effects of altitude can prevent even the fittest climber from continuing.  We have chosen the Lemosho Route, one of the least used of the 7 possible paths, which involves camping for 6 nights on the mountain and should give us plenty of time to acclimatise successfully.<br />
 <br /><br /><br />
Climbing Kilimanjaro is something that one thinks long and hard about, and in that thought process it becomes obvious that there must be a significant reason for doing it. For me is partly about the challenge, and partly about the opportunity that this creates for helping others and giving something back. For that reason I would really appreciate it if you could help me raise some money for an important charity.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2006/10/local_group_mag.html">Local Group: Magnet</a></h3>

<p><em>Magnet, a community initiative to support and inspire people with work related aspirations!</em></p>

<p><strong>What is Magnet?</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://stmargarets.london/directory/group/200610120518">Magnet</a> is a forum that allows the informal coming together of people (mainly women at the moment) who live in our community and share an interest in their work arrangements/choices/needs.  Though not exclusively, this is largely driven by the need to address the balance of parenting and work demands.  There are, however, people who just want to contribute to a community effort.</p>

<p>Magnet&#39;s agenda seeks to address the work related needs of members either through formal sessions (presentations at our meetings) or through the Magnet network (either at the meetings or on the Magnet grapevine which is flourishing!</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2006/10/event_reminder_12.html">Event Reminder: Community Day at Moormead</a></h3>

Come and help plant bulbs (daffodils) at Moor Mead on <a href="https://stmargarets.london/event/Meeting/200610050726">Saturday 14th October</a>. Meet at the pavilion at 11am.

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2006/10/play_racing_dem.html">Upcoming Play: Racing Demon by Richmond Shakespeare Society</a></h3>

<p><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/play_racing_demon.html"></a></p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#39;t even say the church was a joke. In our area it&#39;s an irrelevance,&#8221; says the spiritually exhausted Rev. Lionel Espy to his Bishop early in <a href="https://stmargarets.london/event/Play/200609290404">Racing Demon</a>. </p>

<p>When David Hare&#39;s play was first staged by the National Theatre in 1990, to much critical acclaim, the Sunday Times wrote: &#39;In conflict with government, torn with internal dissentions on matters of doctrine and practice, the Church of England finds itself enjoying unwelcome publicity&#39;</p>

<p>Racing Demon is as relevant today as it was in Mrs Thatcher&#39;s era, and Twickenham audiences are fortunate to have the opportunity to enjoy this compelling play on the stage of the Mary Wallace Theatre.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2006/10/par_vinu_wine_b.html">Par Vinu Wine Receives its Bar License</a></h3>

<p>The hearing for the licence application for Par Vinu, the proposed wine bar under Phelps, is was on Tuesday, 10 October at 7.00 in York House.  Despite 88 letters of objection they received their license.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2006/10/mr_frisby_local.html">Mr. Frisby &#8212; Local Butcher Retires</a></h3>

<p>Mr Frisby will be sadly missed as our local butcher. As many residents will know he had to retire owing to health problems. His meat was always of the best quality and he was still climbing the stairs to the cold room at the age of 80! Let&#39;s hope that whoever takes the Crown Road shop over, it will keep it&#39;s unique interior&#8230; Is there a butcher in the parish!?  </p>

<p>&#8212; <em>from Tricia Evans</em></p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2006/10/fancy_a_good_si.html">Fancy a good sing?</a></h3>

<p>If you&#39;re even the tiniest bit musical, or are perhaps daunted by the professionalism &#8212; and subscriptions &#8212; of some of the local Choirs, why not sample the newest venture, a Community Choir, being set up by Richmond College lecturer Caroline Heslop. Repertoire will range from classics to shows, blues to opera, and, most importantly, no previous experience is required (none of us at the first session could read a note, but we had great fun, and we got to make music). Rehearsals are Wednesday, 6.30pm - 8.00pm in the Music Centre, Richmond College, Egerton Road. The cost, just &#163;2.00 (&#163;1.00 concessions). You&#39;ll be made very welcome.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2006/10/new_noticboard.html">New Noticboard</a></h3>

<p><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/noticeboard1.html"></a></p>

<p>St Margarets finally has its own noticeboard, located opposite the St Margarets Tavern at the top of Crown Road.  It is for use by all residents to give information about forthcoming, or results of past events. It will also carry details of Police, <span class="caps">RFU </span>and Council events of interest but no commercial advertising. </p>

<p>Cllr Geoff Acton said, &#8220;we hope that all residents will find it a valuable addition to the St Margarets&#39; street scene.&#8221;<br />
 <br /><br /><br />
Councillor Philip Morgan is in charge of content and will keep a set of keys, an additional set will be held at the Post Office.  Philip can be contacted on 020 8892 6044 or via the Council website on <a href="mailto:cllr.pmorgan@richmond.gov.uk">cllr.pmorgan@richmond.gov.uk</a>.</p>
