<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2010/04/give_us_yer_money_its_hocktide.html">Give Us Yer Money! - It&#39;s Hocktide!</a></h3>

<p><img alt="chuggers" src="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/chuggers-thumb.png" width="150" height="150"  align="right" style="padding: 2px; border: 1px solid #ccc;" /></p>

<p><em>Monday and Tuesday 12<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> April</em></p>

<p>In times past, long before local government began shoving its sticky fingers deep into our pockets, individual parishes were responsible for raising the money they needed for local services. Some had tolls on their roads, others introduced rates and Brentford organised fund-raising sports days and public entertainments.</p>

<p>In 1621 articles were drawn up to regulate these money-raising activities, one of which consisted of &#8220;convivial gatherings in the church house.&#8221;</p>

<p>The article states:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;The inhabitants had for many years been accustomed to have meetings in their church house and other places there, in friendly manner, to eat and drink together, and liberally to spend their monies, to the end that neighbourly society be maintained and also a common stock raised for the repair of the church, maintaining of orphans, placing poor children in service and defraying other charges.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2010/04/how_green_is_my_council.html">How Green is my Council?</a></h3>

<p><em>Or, I&#8217;m only a resident get me out of here</em></p>

<p>Hands up everyone who thought the Council run Arragon Road car park behind Waitrose in Twickenham was for everyone?  Well it is, but if you&#8217;re a resident you&#8217;re pretty low down on the pecking order for finding a car parking space during the week, especially if you want to shop in Waitrose.</p>

<p>I asked two of the Waitrose management team, if they were aware of the problem.  They certainly were. Since late last year Waitrose shoppers have been complaining to them that they find it difficult if not impossible to find a space in the largest car park in the borough any time after 9-30 on a Monday to Friday.  Towards the end of February over a two-week period I spent several weekdays visiting the car park at different terms, and sure enough the number of spaces available during those visits, averaged 5 out of a possible 437.</p>

<p>It seems that the car park is now monopolised by three flavours of long stay parkers.  Commuters who discovered during the cold weather transport difficulties that it costs relatively little - &#163;8.70p to park from 7am to up until midnight - business users with a parking permit - and not forgetting up to around 150 Council staff who have permits allowing them to use the car park.  If the latter all choose to park there on any one day that takes care of around 34% of the spaces.</p>

<p>Cllr Philip Morgan has been pressing the Highway Department to do this for many months; now, at last, it&#8217;s happening. Work will start on Tuesday April 6 and take 10 weeks. There will be temporary traffic signals for the first two weeks of the project, off peak only; the current permanent signals will operate from week 3 to week 10.</p>
