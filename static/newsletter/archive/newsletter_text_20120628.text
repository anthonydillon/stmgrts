ï»¿LOCAL JOB VACANCY: SOCIAL MEDIA WORK EXPERIENCE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The St Margarets Traders Association is keen to increase the use
    of it's website www.mystmargarets.com by developing new social
    media campaigns and exciting web site content. They are seeking a
    local person looking for work experience around the web and social
    media marketing.

    You would be given support and guidance by working with the
    association's web team and traders, but a fair bit of space
    to experiment. The role would include running a series of
    promotions and activities via Facebook, Twitter and the web
    by working with local businesses to promote St Margarets and
    the traders.

A MOST IMPORTANT DECISION - 6 JUNE 1944
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    "Soldiers, sailors and airmen of the Allied Expeditionary Force.
     You are about to embark upon the great crusade, toward which we
     have striven these many months. The eyes of the world are upon you.
     The hope and prayers of liberty-loving people everywhere march
     with you."

     - Dwight D. Eisenhower -- June 6, 1944

    Our lives are shaped by the decisions that we make. Some are
    marginal. "Shall I have tea or coffee this morning?" "Shall I take
    a coat today". Others are far wider reaching. "Shall I buy this
    house or that one?" "Shall I marry this person or another?" There
    are some decisions however that are so important, so all
    encompassing that they affect not just our lives but also the lives
    of others and their children and grand children and their overall
    destinies far into the future..

    One such decision was made on the 5th June 1944 by two men - one
    from Abilene Kansas and the other from Kew.

NEWSFLASH:  TWICKEREE - 24 JUNE 2012
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    St Margarets Win The Derby!

    Despite the appalling weather and their abysmal sporting record the
    1st St Margarets Cub Pack won the Tri-Annual Soap Box Derby at the
    Twickeree Camp this weekend in Marble Hill Park. Competing
    against 14 other Packs the 23 strong squad of boys and girls
    pushed, panted and propelled their home-made cart through heats,
    quarter and semi finals and eventually the final itself to victory.
    The only thing to decide now is who gets to look after the
    trophy first!
