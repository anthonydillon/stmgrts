EVENT REMINDER: THE WEDDING SINGER - 7 TO 13 SEPTEMBER 2013
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    You're invited to join the award winning Twickenham Operatic
    Society as they take you back to a time when hair was big, greed
    was good, collars were up, and a wedding singer might just be the
    coolest guy in the room.

    It's 1985 and rock-star wannabe Robbie Hart is New Jersey's
    favourite wedding singer. He's the life of the party, until his own
    fiancée leaves him at the altar. Shot through the heart, Robbie
    makes every wedding as disastrous as his own. Enter Julia, a
    winsome waitress who wins his affection. As luck would have it,
    Julia is about to be married to a Wall Street shark, and unless
    Robbie can pull off the performance of a decade, the girl of his
    dreams will be gone forever.

COME SING WITH VOCALITY - SEPTEMBER 2013
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Why not try some singing this autumn?

    Vocality Singing's unusual repertoire of uplifting harmony songs
    from around the world will help to brighten your evenings
    this autumn.

    Suitable for anyone who loves to sing, Vocality is a fun and
    friendly choir which meets on Tuesdays 8.00-10.00pm at St Mary's
    Junior School on Richmond Road, starting again this term from
    10 September.

    There are no auditions and as everything is learned by ear, no need
    to read music. We encourage people to try different parts if they
    wish, and provide all the material so you can practice at home.
    Songs are chosen from a wide range of genres - folk, jazz, gospel,
    ethnic, classic pop and even the odd drinking song! - to raise
    the spirits.

    We have a great bunch of people of all ages and from all walks
    of life and warmly welcome new members. Come and give us a try
    with a free taster session.
