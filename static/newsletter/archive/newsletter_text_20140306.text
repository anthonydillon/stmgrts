ï»¿THE TRAGIC DEATH OF MISS NITA FOY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    THE TIMES - APRIL 3rd 1930

    GIRL'S DEATH FROM FIRE IN FILM STUDIO

    Miss Nita Foy was burned to death when her clothing caught fire
    at the Twickenham Film Studio. Miss Foy was one of several chorus
    girls appearing in "Here Comes The Bride" at the Piccadilly Theatre
    who were to take part in a ballet scene in a film. The girls were
    wearing crinoline dresses and in a way not yet explained Miss Foy's
    dress caught fire.

    We don't know very much about Nita Foy. Her real name was Annie Foy
    Tipping. She was a dancer and actress. She lived with her aunt and
    uncle in Maida Vale and she was described in the 'Richmond and
    Twickenham Times' as "a pretty, laughing, golden-haired girl of
    but twenty summers." She wanted to be a star.

EVENT REMINDER: PLAY - WE CAN DO IT! - 19 TO 22 MARCH 2014
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    We Can Do It! This is an original musical theatre production
    about life in Isleworth and the surrounding areas of Twickenham and
    Richmond during the 2nd World War and how people coped. It features
    a cast of over 60 actors, singers and dancers drawn from the
    community, spanning in age from 6 to 79.

    The play traces the lives of 5 local people, some still living
    in the community and we include Barnes Wallace, Amy Gentry,
    champion rower, and Brendan Finucane, ace Spitfire Pilot.

    Much of our focus is on how single mothers coped with raising their
    families and taking on the jobs of men who were drafted away, hence
    the title.
