COUNCIL FIRES ITS TOWN CENTRE MANAGERS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    On the 30th of October, St Margarets Councillor, Simon Lamb fired 
    the borough�s three highly respected town centre managers, 
    including St Margaret's resident, Karen Pengelly, who was the 
    Richmond Town Centre Manager. The reason given was to save money; 
    however, at the same time they fired the managers, they created a 
    fund with 2/3rds of the money saved going to an 'initiative fund' 
    for local businesses to fund events. The resulting savings to the 
    Council is only �20,000.
