<h3>Don&#8217;t Miss &#8216;A Very Magical Flute&#8217;</h3>

<p>Don&#8217;t miss this weekend&#8217;s performances of the 2&#215;2 Opera&#8217;s &#8216;A Very Magical Flute&#8217; at All Soul&#8217;s Church.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;This is a new and exciting adaptation of Mozart&#8217;s &#8216;Magic Flute&#8217; by Keith to celebrate the 250th anniversary of Mozart&#8217;s birth &#8212;  a young boy, refusing to practice his flute, is transported back to 1791 and finds himself in the middle of a chaotic dress rehearsal for the first performance. He meets the opera&#8217;s librettist, Emanuel Schickaneder, who gives him a singing role and explains the story interwoven with extracts from the opera. The boy experiences the frenetic activity that precedes the opening night &#8212; alongside petty jealousy&#8217;s and gossip, the scenery isn&#8217;t ready, neither are the costumes, the company has run out of money and Mozart hasn&#8217;t actually finished the opera yet!&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The performances are on Friday 24th March at 7.30pm and Saturday 25th March at 2.30pm and 7.30pm, all at All Soul&#8217;s Church, Northcote Road, St. Margarets. Tickets are &#163;8 / &#163;4.50 available on the door or in advance by calling 020 8891 4641.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/assets/images/2006/UNDERGROUND-thumb.jpg" width="150" height="121" alt="underground" align="right" /></p>

<p>The Richmond branch of the District Line will be closed for the nine days from the 1<sup>st</sup> to the 10<sup>th</sup> of April from Richmond to Turnham Green.  Underground tickets will be accepted on South West Trains to Waterloo and there will be two replacement bus services.  Additional works are planned for the Sunday mornings of 16, 23, 30 April and 28 May 2006.</p>

<p>Network Rail, the company that owns and maintains the District line track from Richmond to Turnham Green will be completing &#8220;much needed engineering improvements that will deliver increased reliability of services.&#8221;  The works include the replacement of the 40 year old track, points, signals and a crossing at Gunnersbury Junction.   The closure was planned over the Easter school holiday when demand should be lower.</p>

<p>Following up from the <a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2006/02/councillors_cpz.html">Councillors <span class="caps">CPZ</span> Questionnaire</a> piece we wrote back in February we have two things to share.

The second are some data and comments from the questionnaires given to the Councillors and shared anonymously with us.</p>
