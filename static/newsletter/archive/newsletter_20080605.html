<p><em>5 June 2008</em></p>

<p>Welcome to the St Margarets Community Website Newsletter (<a href="https://stmargarets.london">stmargarets.london</a>). Occasional Thursdays we will send you the latest news and events from the website.</p>



<h2>Latest News</h2>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2008/06/harry_hampton_the_hero_of_haliburton_road.html">Harry Hampton - The Hero of Haliburton Road</a></h3>

<p><img src="https://stmargarets.london/assets/images/2008/hampton_small-thumb.jpg" width="101" height="200" alt="Harry Hampton"  align="right" style="padding: 2px; border: 1px solid #ccc;" /></p>

<p>If you are looking for heroes with chiselled jaws, cool unflinching eyes and nerves of steel you had better start flicking through the pages of your old comic books &#8212; because you won&#8217;t find them in real life. Most heroes are ordinary men and women who just happen to do extraordinary things. There could be a hero or two standing behind you in the queue for the H37. There could be a hero or two living in your street&#8230; there certainly was in ours!</p>

<p>Local lad Harry Hampton was 29 years old and a sergeant in the King&#8217;s Liverpool Regiment. On 21st August 1900, in the second year of the Boer War, he rescued a small party of men who were under fire and heavily outnumbered by Boers at Van Wyk&#8217;s Vlei. During the course of the action Harry Hampton was twice wounded, once in the head. For his courage he was awarded Britain&#8217;s highest award for gallantry, the Victoria Cross.</p>

<p>After the 1st World War, during which he served as a musketry instructor, Harry and his wife Gertrude came to live in Haliburton Road in St Margarets. In 1922 Harry collapsed on the platform at St. Margarets Station and fell in front of a passing train.  Although persistent gossip suggested that he had committed suicide the verdict of the coroner at the inquest was clear. Harry&#8217;s leg had given way because of an old injury. He was buried in the old Burial Ground in Richmond leaving behind his wife and two children: a daughter, Elsie and a son, also known as Harry who worked in a pub in Richmond.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2008/06/nsmra_your_local_quiz_inquisitors.html">NSMRA &#8212; Your Local Quiz Inquisitors</a></h3>

<p>The <a href="https://stmargarets.london/directory/group/200506300538">North St Margarets Residents Association</a> is proud of some of its more bizarre endeavours to help raise the spirit of their community. Why go for boring whist drives and jumble sales when you can unite a neighbourhood with first-run film shows, re-enactments of arcane Anglo Saxon rituals, barn dances, skiffle classes (ask your granddad!)  and an annual street sale?</p>

<p>The street sale is a particular favourite. Held at the end of the summer the residents simply stick tables outside their houses, cover them with as much bric-a-brac and object d&#8217;art (a.k.a junk) as they can find and then sell it to the hundreds of visitors who come from all over to snap up the bargains. It is rather like a huge car boot sale but without the car&#8230; or the boot!</p>

<p>The latest NSMRA venture into community conscious-raising is a combined quiz, supper and children&#8217;s film show all rolled into one. While the children watch a specially picked DVD in one room, their parents get down to answering some scalp scratching questions in another&#8230;.and even the questions are unusual. Unlike most other quizzes where it is hard academic knowledge that is being tested, the dedicated NSMRA quizzer does his or her research looking at the back of corn flake packets,  underneath children&#8217;s toys and inside back issues of  &#8216;Exchange and Mart.&#8217;</p>

<p>The object, of course, is not to win big prizes &#8212; because there aren&#8217;t any &#8212; but to impress your neighbours by proving that you can tell the difference between smoky bacon and cheese and onion crisps. In north St Margarets competitive crisp consideration is rapidly becoming a major spectator sport!</p>

<p>The <a href="https://stmargarets.london/event/meeting/200705141868">NSMRA Quiz Night</a> is on Saturday June 21st at the Church Hall in Northcote Road.</p>

<p><a href="https://stmargarets.london/event/meeting/200705141869">The Great Annual Street Sale - GASS</a> takes place in and around Haliburton Road on the afternoon of Saturday 6th September.</p>
