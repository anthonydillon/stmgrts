HE WAS ONE OF THE RIGHT GOOD SORT
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    On the 31st December 1915, near the village of Vermelles in
    northern France, a platoon of soldiers from the 19th Battalion
    of the 1st London Regiment were being lead out of the front line
    trenches by their sergeant, B.A Few. Somehow on the way, in the
    confusion of the trenches, saps and communication lines crossing
    each other the platoon got lost. Tired, dirty and anxious to get
    to their billets and comparative safety, one man, Corporal Percy
    Davies, calmly climbed up onto the parapet to see if he could find
    the route back to the rear area. While he was standing there he was
    shot and killed by a German sniper.

TALK: VILLAGE TREASURES OF HOUNSLOW BOROUGH - 23 MAY 2014
----------------------------------------------------------------------
     
    Village Treasures of Hounslow Borough: a talk by Christine Diwell,
    one of the founder members of the Hounslow Heritage Guides who have
    been leading heritage tours for 20 years.

    Her talk highlights the towns and villages that today form the
    basis of the London Borough of Hounslow, including: Bedfont with
    its picturesque 11th-century church; the Royal Manor of Hanworth
    where extensive farmland was owned by William Whiteley, whose store
    won him the name of Universal Provider; Brentford, a mixture of
    fine house and industry; Isleworth bordered by the Thames, with a
    man-made river at its centre, and once home to the painter Vincent
    Van Gogh.
