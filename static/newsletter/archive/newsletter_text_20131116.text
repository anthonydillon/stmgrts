LATEST NEWS
===========================================================



ï»¿MR SWEETING - THE BOY CURATE OF NUNNELY
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    "Mr. Sweeting was bantered about his stature -- he was a little
     man, a mere boy in height and breadth compared with the athletic
     Malone; rallied on his musical accomplishments -- he played the
     flute and sang hymns like a seraph, some young ladies of his parish
     thought; sneered at as 'the ladies pet; teased about his mamma and
     sisters, for whom poor Mr. Sweeting had some lingering regard."

      -- 'SHIRLEY' by Charlotte Bronte


    Victorian novels are awash with clerics of all ranks and
    persuasions reflecting their prominent and important role in the
    society of the time. Charlotte Bronte's second novel "Shirley",
    published in 1849 has at least four of them - Mr. Helstone, the
    rector of Briarfield and his three curates, Mr. Donne, Mr. Malone,
    and Mr. Sweeting. Apparently they spent their time debating "minute
    points of ecclesiastical discipline, frivolities which seem as
    empty as bubbles to all save themselves"... which sounds like fun.

RIVER CRANE CATCHMENT PLAN RELEASED
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    In February 2011, the UK Government - through the Defra Statement
    of Position - supported the Catchment Based Approach as a viable
    mechanism to improve the water environment as part of Water
    Framework Directive activities. During April 2011, the Environment
    Agency started piloting new approaches in 10 catchments and a
    further 15 pilot areas were established in January 2012, managed
    by external organisations. Funding from Defra was provided to
    assist with the catchment plan preparation.

    In addition to these original 25 catchments, a further 41
    initiatives on other catchments were funded, led by organisations
    that expressed an interest to pilot the catchment approach. The
    Crane catchment is one of the latter 41 selected, forming part
    of the London catchment within the Thames River Basin District.

    The Crane catchment plan was prepared by the London Wildlife Trust
    in partnership with the members of the CVP.

    The Plan was launched at the Crane Valley Conference on 4
    October 2013.

COMMUNITY ROADS AND PAVEMENTS FUND
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Help decide how 35,000 pounds is spent in your local area 

    As part of the Council's drive to improve the environment of the
    borough and after listening to comments from its 'All in One'
    consultation, an annual community road and pavement funding pot
    of 35,000 pounds has been made available for highway maintenance in each
    of the fourteen village areas in the borough. This sum (in total
    490,000 pounds) is in addition to the maintenance work being carried out
    by the Council, and each year local residents will be invited
    to suggest how the money should be spent in their area.
