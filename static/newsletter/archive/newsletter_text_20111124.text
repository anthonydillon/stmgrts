OCCUPY LONDON AND THE GARDENERS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Occupy London activists camped outside St Paul's Cathedral will
    today be given 24 hours notice to remove their tents and equipment
    before high court proceedings are issued, the City of London
    corporation said yesterday.

    Occupy London, which arrived in the churchyard on 15 October, last
    week rejected a request to scale back part of its camp to allow
    better fire engine access. The notice applies to tents standing
    on public highways.

    THE GUARDIAN - Wednesday 16th November 2011


    The Occupy London protest is not the first to have upset the good
    people of St Paul's. There were similar ructions in 1345. Then the
    dispute was not about anti-capitalism but about fruit and veg...
    and chickens.

POEMS IN THE PARK ATTRACTS 650 LOCAL POETS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Young and older poets from St Margaret's and Twickenham were
    among the 22 shortlisted finalists for the inaugural Poems in the
    Park competition organised by The Friends of Richmond Park and
    Sheengate Publishing (publishers of The Richmond and Elmbridge and
    Kingston magazines).

    The competition was launched in the Spring and reached it's
    culmination during November at an awards presentation at The Royal
    Ballet School in the centre of Richmond Park. The winners,
    runners-up and commendations were judged in three age categories
    (12 and under, 13-18 and 19+) from over 650 entries received
    across a wide area of south west London. The judges for the
    competition included renowned children's author Dame Jacqueline
    Wilson, Sir Trevor McDonald, the editors of the two co-sponsoring
    magazines and local poet Paddy Hughes.

    Dame Jacqueline said of the competition: "I'm a veteran of judge
    children's poetry competitions, but these entries were
    truly outstanding".

    The winning poems and poets, a full story and photographs of the
    event can be seen

INITIAL RESPONSES TO POLLUTION DAMAGE OF THE RIVER CRANE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Late last month there was a devastating pollution incident on the
    River Crane that killed at least 10,000 fish and is likely to take
    several years to fully recover from. The Friends of the River Crane
    Environment (FORCE) is a local volunteer group that has been
    working to improve the Crane corridor for the last eight years and
    last Sunday the group held its first volunteer event since the
    pollution spill.

    Rob Gray, Chair of FORCE, said; "Over 20 local people turned out
    to help us on the day and we got a lot done, maintaining and
    improving the green spaces in Crane Park. Just as pleasing were the
    large numbers of local families, out in the park for the day, who
    were interested in our work and concerned about the pollution,
    but clearly not put off from enjoying their local park". Our
    picture shows Jo Tipping helping to weed the hedge we planted
    last year.
