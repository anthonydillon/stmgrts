ï»¿THE DUEL - A COMBAT OF HONOUR
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    DUEL, n, andv.1 fight with deadly weapons between two persons,
    in presence of two seconds, to settle quarrel.

    Hounslow Heath once had a fearsome reputation for a wide variety
    of unsavoury activities, including murder, highway robbery, the
    general seduction of the innocent and gullible and the execution
    of assorted miscreants and subsequent grisly exhibition of their
    corpses. It was also, at a time when individuals settled their
    differences with swords and pistols, a perfect place for duels. In
    his admirable history of the area, "And So Make A City Here",
    historian G.E Bate notes a couple for our interest...

    His first example was fought in horseback on 1st August 1603
    between Sir John Townshend, and his kinsman Sir Matthew Browne.
    Following a disagreement between the two men a challenge was thrown
    down and accepted and both men rode out to Hounslow Heath to settle
    the matter with swords. Unfortunately during the fight both men
    were fatally wounded. Sir Matthew died on the spot and Sir John the
    following day, 2nd August.

COUNCILLORS COLLECT 500 SIGNATURES AGAINST CHELSEA FC
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Local St Margarets and North Twickenham Councillor, Alexander
    Ehmann has turned up the heat on the Board of the Rugby Football
    Union (RFU). Only a week after he and local Councillors Ben Khosa
    and Geoff Acton wrote to the Board of the RFU to express their
    serious concerns about Chelsea Football Club's proposed move
    to Twickenham Stadium, Cllr Ehmann has recruited over 500 local
    residents to the campaign against Chelsea's move.

    Setup only a week ago, Cllr Ehmann's petition, which has gained
    over 500 signatories, calls on the Board of the RFU to reject the
    plan put forward by Chelsea Football Club, proposing that they
    temporarily relocate to Twickenham Rugby Stadium. The petition
    (which can be found at tinyurl.com/NoFootballTwickenham explains
    that residents have legitimate concerns about the impact of at
    least 19 home fixtures of Chelsea Football Club being played
    at Twickenham Rugby Stadium.

FIREWORKS 2014 FROM FOR SANITY'S SAKE
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Guy Faulk's night can be great fun but beware that small children
    are terrified of the loud bangs or sometimes imagine the fireworks
    will fall out of the sky on to their heads...which can spoil the
    enjoyment somewhat! Try and watch fireworks from a good distance
    to minimise stress or take some ear defenders.

    Three of the best in the area are shown below but do let us know if
    your school or community are holding a smaller display and we'll
    include them in our list - email: rachel@forsanityssake.com.

    Or you can watch from top of Richmond Hill for free and see many
    of London's displays from a distance (much quieter) and there is
    pedestrianised space for kids to run around a bit - plus the
    Roebuck pub opposite for a few drinks to aid the fun.

SCRUMMY MUMMIES HEALTHY COOKING CLUB
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    October half term looms! What does this mean to you? The
    inconvenience of not being able to rely on the usual termly
    routines and activities? The unnerving prospect of keeping the kids
    entertained and away from each other's throats while the weather
    gradually deteriorates and the living room seems to shrink
    before your eyes?

    Fear not! By the time you've perused these ideas for half term fun,
    not only will you be feeling relieved and reassured, you may even
    have picked up your parenting baton, vowed to get the paints and
    kitchen scales out and be ready to hit half term as the Super Mum
    you've always been destined to be!

    So, now that's settled, what are you going to tackle first?
