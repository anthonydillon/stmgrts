<p>Welcome to the St Margarets Community Website Newsletter (<a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk">www.stmgrts.org.uk</a>). Occasional Thursdays we will send you the latest news and events from the website.</p>



<h2>Latest News</h2>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2008/05/join_the_adventure.html"><span class="caps">JOIN THE ADVENTURE</span>!</a></h3>

<p>The 1<sup>st</sup> St Margarets Scout Group came into being nearly 90 years ago. As their motto says, they&#8217;ve been &#8220;in tents since 1919&#8221;!</p>

<p>From a small group of boys meeting in a dusty Church Hall the group has grown spectacularly. Now there is a lively Beavers colony for the under 8&#8217;s, a 20 strong Cub Pack, a Scout Troop and an Explorer Unit for the older Scouts. Such is the expansion that the Group has just been awarded a special certificate to mark the impressive increase in membership.</p>

<p>Scouting has also developed since 1919. Tying knots and putting up tents may still be part of the programme but today&#8217;s activities include canoeing, abseiling, go karting, survival training, computer skills and even spending nights in some strange places like the gun deck of &#8220;H.M.S Belfast&#8221; or the vaults at London Dungeon! Modern Scouting is also open at all levels to girls. I wonder what Baden Powell who founded the movement would think of that!?</p>

<p>Success does bring its own problems however and now the 1<sup>st</sup> St Margarets is looking for helpers and leaders to take the group forward. In particular the Beavers, aged between 6 and 8 years, are looking for a leader to organise their meetings and guide them through their many activities. Life in the Beaver Colony can be great fun and challenging too, but there is help on all sides. As well as full support from within the Group, the Scout Organisation itself has a website bursting with suggestions for activities and games.</p>

<p>The main principle of Scouting is to help young people develop their own potential, physically, intellectually, spiritually and socially. It doesn&#8217;t take much to set a young person on the right road and this is your chance to do just that. Remember what the wise old owl Socrates said&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;No man goeth about a more godly purpose then he who is mindful of the right upbringing not only of his own, but of other men&#8217;s children&#8221;.</p></blockquote>

<p>If you would like to learn more about becoming a leader or helper please ring Anna Scothern on 020 8332 9068 or by E Mail to <a href="mailto:%61%6E%6E%61%73%63%6F%74%68%65%72%6E%40%79%61%68%6F%6F%2E%63%6F%6D">annascothern@yahoo.com</a></p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2008/05/the_red_hot_follow_up_story.html">The Red Hot Follow Up Story</a></h3>

<p><img src="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/narkdrool-thumb.jpg" width="101" height="150" alt="Nark Drool and the Shudders"  align="right" class="padding: 2px; border: 1px solid #ccc;" /></p>


<p>About a year ago a local bunch of gently decaying rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll musicians realised that the only way they were going to save their much loved band, the Shudders, from dereliction and destitution, was to take on a couple of hip shaking chantoosies, who could &#8216;shoo bee doo&#8217; like the Shirelles and &#8216;dah doo ron ron&#8217; like the Ronettes.</p>

<p>So&#8230;</p>

<p>They placed a <a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2007/05/rock_n_roll_vocalists_needed.html">smoothly worded small ad</a> in the prestigious pages of the St Margarets Community Website Newsletter stating quite bluntly that age and experience were totally immaterial&#8230; Rock Chicks Needed!</p>

<p>Soon&#8230;</p>

<p>A couple of totally inexperienced hip shaking chantoosies appeared and before long had doo lang doo lang&#8217;ed their way into the band&#8217;s hearts and more importantly the band&#8217;s repertoire. Inevitably they became known as &#8216;The Shudderelles&#8217;.</p>

<p>Now the same bunch of rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll musicians - no longer gently decaying - and their hip shaking chantoosies are ready to make some noise. You can catch them in action, as live as you like, at the St Margarets Fair on Saturday 12<sup>th</sup> July and the Strawberry Hill Music Fair, the following day, Sunday 13<sup>th</sup> July. Just look out for &#8220;Nark Drool and the Shudders, featuring the Sensational Shudderelles&#8221;.</p>

<p>Which only goes to show. It does pay to advertise. Locally. In the St Margarets Community Website Newsletter.</p>

<p>For more information on the band please contact:-</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2008/05/more_on_marble_hill_concerts.html">More on Marble Hill Concerts</a></h3>

<p>We asked Tim Beale, the Visitor Operations Manager of Marble Hill House, why only two concerts this year?  Here was the reply:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;With <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">IMG </span></span></span>pulling out of managing the concerts we were initially faced with the prospect of no concerts. Luckily MA concerts stepped in but as you can imagine this was at quite a late stage so almost impossible to book good artists at such short notice.</p>

<p>We are still hoping that the amendment to the premises licence is granted to allow us to have a third concert on the Friday night.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
