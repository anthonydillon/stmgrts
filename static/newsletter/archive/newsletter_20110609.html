RICHMOND IS PROUD THAT ONE OF HER

<p>Their names are slowly fading from our memory, the fighter aces of the Battle of Britain - Douglas Bader, &#8216;Tiger&#8217; Malan, Bob Stanford Tuck and the rest. But there is one name that we should perhaps hold onto a little longer, not just because he was one of the very best but because he once lived amongst us in Richmond.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2011/06/a_plan_for_st_margarets.html">A Plan for St Margarets</a></h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.mystmargarets.com">St Margarets Traders Association</a> has published a leaflet that will soon be distributed to local residents.  It highlights the Traders ideas for improving the high street without cost to the Council.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;We love St Margarets and care that it retains its village atmosphere and unique identity. We don&#8217;t want St Margarets to become another faceless town dominated by the major multiples or allow it to deteriorate to an area plagued by unsightly and vacant shop units. The St Margarets Traders Association has been working hard to ensure that we promote and protect all that is special about St Margarets.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Ideas include getting a fishmonger and a bakery and adding more retail space on St Margarets and Crown Roads.</p>

<p>You can <a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/images/St_Margarets_plan.pdf">download and read the leaflet</a> [pdf]</p>

<p>Last year, over 13,500 local people took the opportunity to have their say about their local areas through the survey run by Richmond Council. That represents 17% of households spread evenly across the borough.</p>

<p>First results from the survey, show that 92 per cent of local people have said they were happy with their local area &#8212; however they did highlight a number of areas that need improving.</p>

<p>We have now fully analysed all the results and are beginning to understand what people want for their local area and villages. To help with the next stage, the Council has organised a series of local area planning events across the borough over the next few months where people will be able to get together to decide what they want for their local area.</p>

<p>If you would like to have your say about the area where you live, please come along to your nearest event, which is on the 11<sup>th</sup> June for Twickenham, St Margarets, East Twickenham and Strawberry Hill Villages in the <a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/event/meeting/200705142790">Civic Centre foyer from 10am to 4pm</a>.</p>

<p>It is time for <a href="http://www.richmond.gov.uk/arthouse_open_studios"><span class="caps">ART</span>house 2011, Richmond&#8217;s annual Open Studios Festival</a>.</p>

<p>Residents and visitors get the chance to experience the abundance of creative talent living and working in the borough. Over the two weekends between 10-19 June artists and creative craftspeople will open their homes and studios to exhibit their work in their own unique environment. Last year&#8217;s festival involved over 150 artists who exhibited their current creations and project in their homes, studios, community centres and schools.</p>

<p>The event provides a wonderful opportunity to meet some of the area&#8217;s finest creative people, pick up creative advice from artists, and even buy original pieces.</p>

<p><em>Admission to all open studio venues is free.</em></p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2011/06/free_30_minutes_of_parking_with_trial_richmond_car.html">Free 30 Minutes of Parking with Trial Richmond Cards</a></h3>

<p><img alt="richmondcard_image.jpg" src="http://www.mystmargarets.com/richmondcard_image-thumb.jpg" width="150" height="96" align="right" /></p>

<p>As part of the Council&#8217;s fair parking programme, over the next few weeks 10,000 residents in the borough will benefit from 30 minutes&#8217; free parking via the free trial Richmond Cards that are being distributed this week.</p>

<p>The trial cards will function between 10 June and 31 August, and allow the holder to receive 30 minutes&#8217; free parking at any Council car park or on street bay. They will also trigger 10 per cent discounts on longer stays. The cards are only available to local residents.</p>

<p>The trial cards are intended to grab attention and promote the full Richmond Card which has the same benefits, and a 20 per cent discount for over-75s but which operate permanently once local people register.</p>

<p>The Thames Angler&#8217;s Conservancy are organising a litter pick and clean-up of the &#8220;Mini Ha-Ha&#8221; on <a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/images//Mini-HaHa-Cleanup.gif" title="See larger version of - poster">Sunday, 12th June at 8am</a>. This will be similar to the one we did recently on the River Crane. Gloves, litter-pickers and bin-bags will be provided, just put on some old clothes and bring yourselves along.</p>

<p>The Mini Ha-Ha is a flood drainage ditch which runs alongside the Thames from Richmond railway bridge downstream as far as Kew Gardens. During high spring tides the river floods the Old Deer Park, the water drains away again via this channel. It is also a haven for wildlife and a spawning ground for fish.</p>

<p>Reports have come into the Thames Anglers Conservancy of a major Tidal Thames Pollution incident on Tuesday.</p>

<p><span class="caps">TAC </span>members have reported seeing may dead Roach, Dace, Bream, schooly Bass and big Flounder. At Blackfriars Bridge, condoms and other toilet waste has been seen on the outgoing tide.</p>

She created her blog Yarnstorm  <a href="http://www.yarnstorm.blogs.com">www.yarnstorm.blogs.com</a> in February 2005 to write about knitting but the contents soon expanded to include many more of life&#8217;s small pleasures such as baking, quilting, sewing, gardening, books and film.  She has thousands of fans worldwide.</p>

<p>She is a regular customer at Mrs Moon and as well as being a superb knitter happens to make rather delicious cakes, which those who come along will be able to verify as she&#8217;s promised to bring a selection with her &#8230; worth a visit&#8230;.!</p>
