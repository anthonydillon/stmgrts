ï»¿A SWEETE, CLEARE AND PLEASANT RIVER
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    The first two red Flood Warnings came together around noon on New
    Year's Day -

    FLOODING IS EXPECTED. IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED.

    The first concerned the Thames from Teddington to Putney Bridge. It
    said that so much water was coming over Teddington Weir it seemed
    likely that it would flood low lying areas like Ranelagh Drive and
    the Thames towpath from Richmond to Kew. The second warning for the
    tidal River Crane was more significant. Although the lower section
    of the Crane is protected from tidal surges in the Thames by a lock
    gate, the warning said that because of the amount of water coming
    down the Crane following recent heavy rainfall the gate could not
    be closed. When the high water going out on the Crane met the surge
    coming in up the Thames with the 2.30pm high tide it would flood
    low lying land and gardens, although it was hoped that houses would
    be spared.

PROPOSED NEW SECONDARY SCHOOL FOR TWICKENHAM
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Over the past two years Richmond Council has been working
    with Richmond upon Thames College on a project to create a new
    purpose built college, new special school and brand new secondary
    school for the borough at the Egerton Road site in Twickenham.

    Recently this prospect has developed into an exciting proposal
    to create a brand new campus of Education and Enterprise, working
    in partnership with The Haymarket Media Group to create their new
    headquarters on the site. All the partners will also work together
    to help shape the curriculum and educational opportunities for the
    secondary school. Harlequins Rugby Club, a neighbour of the current
    College, has committed to support this proposal, along
    with Waldegrave School.

CAN YOU TINKLE THE IVORIES?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    A local 1950's style rock 'n' roll group are looking for a keyboard
    player to enhance their sound. Their repertoire ranges from Jerry
    Lee Lewis rockers to smoochy teen ballads and twangy instrumentals.
    Age and experience are totally immaterial. The only qualification
    needed is Enthusiasm! For fun and some fee-paying gigs too!

    Please contact Billy Sincere on 0208 892 5211.

REMINDER - NEW PRIMARY FREE SCHOOL PLANNED FOR ST MARGARETS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Richmond Bridge Primary School is a proposed free school which
    plans to open in the St Margarets area of Richmond in September
    2015. Initially opening with two Reception classes, the school will
    grow organically to its full capacity of 420 pupils.

    Your support can make it happen!

    We intend to apply to the Department for Education in early January
    2014 and in order for our submission to be successful we need
    to show that, among many other things, we have the support
    of parents and the community. If you are considering sending your
    child(ren) to Richmond Bridge Primary, please show your support
    on the school's website.

    We have enjoyed meeting many members of the local community over
    the past few weeks, and have been delighted by the positive
    response to our proposed school.

    Your support is much appreciated.
    Richmond Bridge Primary Team

RAISE YOUR VOICE WITH VITAL VOICES!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    A New Way of using your Voice

    Vital Voices is a new way of learning to sing, taking your voice
    in a new musical direction- it's not something you may have
    experienced before, or seen on TV -it's not Glee, nor a Church
    Choir or a community sing-song but a way to give Voice to the music
    inside you, and share it with others in a relaxed setting.

    We not only sing part songs but work on developing range and tone,
    learn to improvise and harmonise by ear, exploring, pushing the
    boundaries, playing with and learning how to care for our voice
    as well as using breathing techniques. There are so many benefits
    to singing, especially in groups and there have been many articles
    in the media recently about some of these.

    We have a lovely sense of community in our group and often do
    fundraising and charity events, although no-one has to perform if
    they don't want to do so.
