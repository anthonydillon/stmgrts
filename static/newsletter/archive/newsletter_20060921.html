<p><em>21 September 2006</em></p>

<p>Welcome to the St Margarets Community Website Newsletter (<a href="https://stmargarets.london">stmargarets.london</a>).  Each Thursday we will send you the latest news and events from the website.</p>

<h2>Latest News</h2>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2006/09/review_brooks_b_1.html">Review : Brook&#39;s Blues Bar</a></h3>

<p>Last night we decided to try the new Thursday evening fixture at the Turk&#8217;s Head Pub, <a href="https://stmargarets.london/directory/music/200608250848">Brook&#8217;s Blues Bar</a>.  On stage were <a href="https://stmargarets.london/event/Concert/200608250858">Fran McGillvray and Mike Burke</a> who played two great sets of classic acoustic blues well into the night.  The atmosphere of Winchester Hall was lovely with candle lit tables, a not to loud sound system, light food and a bar.  Its has more of a club feel than a concert, so great to bring your friends.  </p>

<p>For &#163;7 its a good value and a fun night out &#8212; highly recommended.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2006/09/your_say_2017_a.html">Your Say 2017 &mdash; A New Consultation</a></h3>

<p>On 13th October a new consultation starts to help determine the future of the next Community Plan for 2007-2017.  <em>Your Say 2017</em> is a campaign being launched by the Local Strategic Partnership , a group of organisations whose aim is to work together to improve services within the borough, including the Police and the health services. </p>

<p>The consultation will take the form of a website through which residents and local people can record their views on key priorities.  People can go <a href="http://www.yoursay2017.org.uk/">online</a> and register from the 19th  September and then it will go live from the 13th October to 3rd November 2006.  </p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2006/09/richmond_volley.html">Richmond Volleyball Summer League Final Results</a></h3>

<p>After 9 weeks of fierce competition, the 1st Richmond Summer League run by Whitton Volleyball Club has named its winners. The games were played in the Old Deer Park and showed some exciting volleyball that attracted a few spectators.</p>

<p>Anthea Hendricks and Neil Kenyon got to the top positions earlier in the competition and maintained them to the end in spite of some very serious claims from other 10 players on the last night of the tournament.  But at the end it was Anthea who took home the bottle of champagne as the first winner of the League. Neil got the second place.  And just one point brought Hamed Malti ahead of David Gilbert as he scooped the third award. </p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2006/09/st_margarets_fa_3.html">St Margarets Fair Update</a></h3>

<p><a href="https://stmargarets.london/event/Fair/200602210457"></a></p>

<p>This year&#8217;s July Fair raised a record &#163;18,000, and here&#8217;s where the money is going.</p>

<p>&#163;1,500 pays for Christmas presents and a meal in the Turks Head for many of St Margarets older residents. There&#39;s a &#163;500 donation to Marble Hill Play Centres. As always the four local schools receive around 50% of the profits, distributed on a points system awarded for the tasks they undertook for the Fair.</p>
