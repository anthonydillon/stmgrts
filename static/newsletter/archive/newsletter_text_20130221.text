THE RETURN OF 'NELLIE THE ELEPHANT'
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    "To Bombay,
     A travelling circus came.
     They brought an intelligent elephant,
     And Nellie was her name.
     One dark night,
     She slipped her iron chain,
     And off she ran to Hindustan
     And was never seen again.
     Ooooooooooooo..."

    "Nellie the Elephant" written by Ralph Butler and Peter Hart (1957)

    Every three years I cycle up to a Scout Hut in Whitton to take a
    First Aid refresher course. It lasts all day and covers most
    aspects of basic first aid, from minor cuts, bruises and nose
    bleeds through to life threatening situations like cardiac arrest,
    choking and anaphylactic shock.

FORMALLY FORMING FRIENDS OF MOORMEAD PARK - 5 MARCH 2013
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    An Open Meeting will be held at The Winchester Hall, Turk's Head,
    Winchester Road on Tuesday 5th March at 7pm

    Further to a meeting in January this meeting is to formally form
    'Friends of Moormead'. The 'Friends of Moormead' will neither be a
    legislative nor an enforcement body. It will exist solely to
    further the full enjoyment of Moormead Park by advising and
    consulting with LBRUT.

    The more people who join the 'Friends of Moormead' the louder our
    voice to ensure we safeguard its future use for the local and
    wider community.
