ï»¿GRIGG MOTORCYCLES
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    "GRIGG - THE HALLMARK OF EXCELLENCE IN ENGINEERING!"

    British motorcyclists are a sentimental bunch. They can get just
    as excited by a list of British motorcycle 'marques' as doing the
    ton up the Kingston by-pass on the back of a 1959 650cc Bonneville
    Twin and who can blame them? It is an illustrious catalogue -
    B.S.A, Triumph, Arial, Norton, Vincent, Matchless, Royal Enfield
    and so on. But there is one name missing from that roll of honour.

CAN YOU FIND PIRATE TREASURE IN ST MARGARETS?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    

    Under the cover of darkness pirates invaded St Margarets last
    night!

    A notorious pirate gang has hidden treasure all over St Margarets...

    Can you help to find the treasure before they return to collect it?

THE GUARDIAN: RUGBY WORLD CUP: WHAT'S IN IT FOR THE RESIDENTS OF TWICKENHAM?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Martyn Day's article Me No See RWC Legacy was picked up by The
    Guardian on 17 August 2015.

    Drunken fans, traffic chaos, rubbish everywhere - Richmond council
    wants pubs to close early, but some locals think there should be
    more of a legacy in return.

    It is every resident's nightmare: inebriated sports fans vomiting
    or urinating on the streets and into front gardens after a match.
    Yet this is what lies in store for the residents of leafy Richmond
    and Twickenham, south-west London, when the Rugby World Cup gets
    under way next month.

SPEED VOLUNTEERING OPPORTUNITY AT HAM HOUSE - 7 TO 11 SEPTEMBER 2015
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    This September, a huge project will be taking place at Ham House.
    Over five days, one hundred volunteers will take part in the effort
    to clear the historic avenues that lead up to the house. We're
    looking for groups from the local community to help make
    this happen.

    Join our One Day Workforce to help restore lush avenues and protect
    the wildlife habitat of our old estate. Working with the National
    Trust, in collaboration with Operation Centaur and Thames Landscape
    Strategy, this is a rare and memorable opportunity to work in a
    team alongside magnificent shire horses to clear our avenues and
    make hay the traditional way.

NEW LICENSING FOR RUGBY WORLD CUP 2015 AGREED
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Council, Metropolitan Police Service, RFU, local publicans and
    Tournament Organisers, England Rugby 2015, have agreed a more
    flexible approach to managing licensing during Twickenham based
    evening matches during Rugby World Cup 2015.

    The revised approach follows a meeting of representatives from all
    of the key stakeholders on Monday 24 August. All parties agreed a
    more flexible approach that would adapt to suit the actual volumes
    of people within key locations and Town Centres on each match day.

    This is a move away from the more fixed approach taken for the
    England vs France QBE International on 15 August which involved
    pubs being asked to voluntarily restrict entry after 10pm.
