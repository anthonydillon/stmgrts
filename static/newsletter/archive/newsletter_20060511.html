<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2006/05/moormead_park_m_1.html">Moormead Park Meeting Update</a></h3>

<p>Last night was the third <a href="https://stmargarets.london/event/Meeting/200603301408">Moormead Park Meeting</a> in Winchester Hall.  The following note was send by Claire Wilson recapping the meeting. </p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Thank you to everyone who joined us last night. The general feeling was that plans agreed for Moormead were progressing well and at the right pace. Following the previous meeting a group of parents had helped choose the furniture for the children&#8217;s playground, these designs were presented last night. Eve Risbridger told the group that they were hoping to have it open for St Margaret&#8217;s Fair on 15 July. There would also be new lighting along the path in front of the playground as had been requested.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2006/05/building_a_comm.html">Building a Community &mdash; Online &amp; Off</a></h3>

<p>The election discussion has thrown up the possibility of us creating an online local community plan for St Margarets.   Everybody could contribute, everybody can take part.   Why not join in.   Leave your party politics at the door.   Come with an open mind and be prepared to learn something new.   Will you show your support for this idea? Will you join in and help to be part of something new that creates an independent vibrant, local identity for our neighbourhood?</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2006/05/visual_voices_s.html">&#8216;Visual Voices&#8217; Show Features Local Artist</a></h3>

<p><img src="https://stmargarets.london/assets/images/2006/art_weight-thumb.jpg" width="100" height="150" alt="Ursula White   Weight, Charcoal on paper, 1.20m x 1m" align="right"/></p>

<p>Caroline Horsbrugh, a local resident, is a member of a working group of artists who graduated from Surrey Institute of Art and Design in July 2000 and exhibit under the name &#8216;Visual Voices&#8217;.  The members of the group come from different parts of the world; India, USA, France and Barbados, but manage to communicate and exhibit together regularly, their work creatively reflecting this diversity.  As the name &#8216;Visual Voices&#8217; suggests each artist brings to the exhibition their own voice and view of the world.</p>
