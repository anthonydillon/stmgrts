<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2009/06/mr_amyands_appendix.html">Mr Amyand&#39;s Appendix</a></h3>

<p><img src="https://stmargarets.london/assets/images/2009/amyand_house-thumb.png" width="150" height="106" alt="AMYAND HOUSE" align="right" style="padding: 2px; border: 1px solid #ccc;" /></p>


<p><strong><span class="caps">DOCTOR  </span> TO <span class="caps">FEMALE PATIENT  </span></strong></p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ve got acute appendicitis&#8230;and the rest of you isn&#8217;t bad either!</p></blockquote>

<p><cite>A <span class="caps">VERY OLD JOKE</span></cite></p>

<p>If the human digestive tract was like South Western Railways, with St Margarets as the mouth, and Waterloo as the rectum the appendix would appear as an unused siding joining the line at Queenstown Road&#8230;</p>

<p>Of course, nobody really knows what the appendix actually does. Some say it is a vestige of the days when we lived in the trees and ate leaves. Others say that it may have something to do with the management of bacteria in the gut.  Most of the time the appendix sits quietly at the junction of the large and small intestine minding its own business - until it decides to become infected and tries to kill us! Then it has to be removed &#8230;and the first surgeon to perform that operation had a family name that is marked and remembered around St Margarets.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2009/06/recipe_rustic_pesto_chicken.html">Recipe: Rustic Pesto Chicken</a></h3>

<p><img src="https://stmargarets.london/assets/images/2009/pesto_chicken-thumb.jpg" width="150" height="107" alt="Pesto Chicken" align="right" style="padding: 2px; border: 1px solid #ccc;" /></p>

<p>This is such an incredibly easy main course that takes only minutes to prepare and uses very few ingredients. It has a wonderful taste of summer and makes great leftovers (if there are any!) This recipe can easily be doubled and other vegetables such as courgettes, mushrooms or peas could be added to the tomatoes in the dish.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2009/06/governor_vacancy_orleans_infant_school.html">Governor Vacancy - Orleans Infant School</a></h3>

<p>The Governing Body of Orleans Infant School currently has a vacancy for a Community Governor.  Governors take a strategic role in guiding and supporting the school&#8217;s work and encouraging further improvement.  The Governing Body meets twice every school term and governors are expected to attend as many meetings as possible, these meetings are generally held in the evening.  In addition to these meetings most Governors will participate in at least one sub committee (normally held in school hours) and should be available to come into school and participate in general school activities on an infrequent basis.</p>

<p>A school governor does not need to have any background in education or to have children at school.  The main criteria are a willingness to learn and a genuine commitment to giving time to the school.   Training for the role is provided by Richmond Borough. If you might be interested in joining the governors of Orleans Infant School, please contact us at <a href="mailto:%69%6E%66%6F%40%6F%72%6C%65%61%6E%73%2E%72%69%63%68%6D%6F%6E%64%2E%73%63%68%2E%75%6B">info@orleans.richmond.sch.uk</a> for further details of the role and application process.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2009/06/the_marathon_de_sables_basic_facts.html">The Marathon de Sables: Basic facts</a></h3>

<p><em>&#8230; about one of the hardest endurance races in the world.</em></p>

<p>The race in 2010 is the 25<sup>th</sup> Marathon de Sables. There will be more than 800 competitors who, like me, have waited 2 and a half years to compete in this event. I was overjoyed at hearing I had a place back in 2007, but now the race is looming and only 10 months away. My training is going well and I am preparing myself for the challenge ahead.</p>

<p>The training for the race has to starts months in advance as competitors have to gather kit (rucksacks, sleeping bags, stoves, dried food, torches, trekking poles, gaiters, good shoes about 2- 3 sizes bigger than normal etc). train for the mileage, mentally prepare and work out how to cope running 156 miles in the heat. Competitors have to carry all their kit with them. They sleep in &#8216;tents&#8217;, which are more like covers than tents. Water is rationed and given out at check points. The sand is so fine that it enters shoes like water. The heat can be extreme from boiling during the day to freezing at night.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2009/06/event_reminder_cornish_farmers_market_at_turks_hea.html">Event Reminder: Cornish Farmers Market at Turk&#39;s Head</a></h3>

<p>There is going to be a Cornish Farmers Market at The Turks Head. Organised by <a href="http://www.marghas.co.uk">Marghas.co.uk</a> (which means market in Cornish) it will be selling Honeys, Clotted Cream, Meats, Fish, Vegetables, Herbs, Cut Flowers and more more. There will be free tastings of Cheeses, Wines, Ciders, Pasties and as well. The market starts from Midday on Saturday, 13<sup>th</sup> June 2009.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.marghas.co.uk">Marghas.co.uk</a> is a small business started up by an ex-St Margarets resident who lives in Cornwall and the local area is being used as the first part of London to target. I&#8217;ve been buying off them for the past  month or so and the quality is fantastic.</p>
