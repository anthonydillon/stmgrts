<p>The 2010 St Margarets Fair was a huge success.  As usually there was wonderful food, great music, terrific stalls, fun rides, fun dog show and weather a bit hot, but not too much.  Thank you to the Fair Committee and all the volunteers who work so hard to make the day special.</p>

<p>This year, Ness Reddick and Martyn Day have taken some lovely photos. Please take a look at the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mahnke/sets/72157624513399152/show/">slideshow on flickr.com</a>.

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2010/07/pillar_boxes.html">Pillar Boxes</a></h3>

<p><img src="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/assets/images/2010//pillar_Richmond-Anonymous_thumb.jpg" width="99" height="150" alt="Anonymous Pillar" class="photo right" style="border: 1px solid #ccc;" align="right" /></p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;An object full of civic dignity, the treasure house of a thousand secrets, the fortress of a thousand souls&#8230; there it stands at all our street corners, disguising one of the most beautiful of ideas under one of the most preposterous of forms.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><cite><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">G.K.</span></span></span> Chesterton</cite></p>

<p>Walk through the archway at Old Richmond Palace towards the Green and you will see in front of you a historical rarity.  It looks so commonplace that most people walk by without even noticing. It is a red, cast iron, pillar-box, just like any of thousands to be found all over the country, but it differs from them in one unusual way. It carries no royal cipher. The box is blank and anonymous. In 1880 the Post Office, facing the same kind of cutbacks as we are today decided that it could not longer afford the &Acirc;&pound;3 it cost to make a pillar-box. To economise it produced the &#8220;Anonymous Cylindrical&#8221; box, with an uncomplicated barrel shape, a smaller slot than earlier boxes and no royal cipher. This did not go down well with the public. They complained that the box carried no indication of whom it belonged, the slot was too small for most envelopes and so close to the roof of the box that letters got stuck. They also didn&#8217;t go for the &#8216;no-cipher&#8217; idea. If the pillar-box contained the Royal Mail, they argued, the very least it should do was carry the royal cipher. So in 1887 the Victoria Cipher box appeared, with a larger and lower slot, the words &#8220;Post Office&#8221; on the front and more importantly Queen Victoria&#8217;s monogram.  1887 was a good year for Britain. The first earmuffs were patented, work started on the Eiffel Tower, Balochistan joined the British Empire and Britain celebrated Queen Victoria&#8217;s Golden Jubilee by slapping the royal moniker on the front of our pillar boxes - a tradition that continues to this day.</p>

The house was destroyed by a bomb in September 1940.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2010/07/event_reminder_the_big_lunch.html">Event Reminder: The Big Lunch</a></h3>

<p>Something has changed on the streets we live on today and looking around our local community it is soon apparent that people are enjoying the rejuvenation of a somewhat more nostalgic era. Neighbours are getting to know one another on a completely new level to those they had previously encountered and the friendships forming are becoming an integral part of their lives.  These are not, as one might be forgiven for thinking, the elderly we live side by side with, who have already seen and reaped the benefits of a more inclusive society.</p>

<p>Recently we have seen communities coming together for various celebrations, but it&#8217;s the day to day relationships that are built on our streets and homes that are creating a transforming community.  Speaking to mothers who were struggling, it was their neighbours they turned to for a cup of coffee and good cry, for those needing help with getting somewhere, it was again those close by who leapt  to their rescue. The stories go on&#8230;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/event/event/200705142469">Sunday 18<sup>th</sup> July</a> marks the day of The Big Lunch which was born out of the Eden Project as a celebration of  life and environment.  Local residents came together last year for street parties to share food, music and all kinds of entertainment which proved a huge success. This year, in Northcote Road,  Twickenham, the local residents will once again gather for this event hosted by the <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">NSMRA. </span></span></span> All Souls church is another of its main contributors,  which already has a  reputation for its many helpful outreach programmes,  proving yet another pivotal anchor in the new spirit of this local community.</p>
