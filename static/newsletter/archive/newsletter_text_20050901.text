ST MARGARETS AUTUMN EVENT NEEDS YOUR HELP
-----------------------------------------------------------
    The St Margarets Autumn Event will be held in Crown Road 
    on Saturday, 17 September 2005. The event is organised by 
    a combined group of residents and traders and sponsored by 
    the RFU. It promises to be a great community event with 
    live music, food stalls, fun fair rides and more.
    
    HOWEVER, THEY NEED MORE GROUPS IN THE COMMUNITY TO 
    GET INVOLVED WITH THE EVENT!
    
    One of the main goals of the event is for local people to 
    raise funds for local projects. Fair organisers are still 
    looking for local groups to come forward and set-up a stall

    The fair organisers, the St Margarets Traderï¿½s Association 
    (traders@stmgrts.org.uk, need to hear from you if you would 
    like to help with fund raising or help with organising the 
    event.
