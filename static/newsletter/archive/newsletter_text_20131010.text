ï»¿THE BRIDGE AT EEL PIE ISLAND
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    "Grand Jazz Band Ball" said the Melody Maker's advertising column.
     "Fully Licensed - Cy Laurie's Jazz Band - Eel Pie Island." I hadn't
     heard Cy Laurie at the time, but I liked the sound of Eel Pie
     island. It seemed to go with 'Gut Bucket' or 'Honky Tonk'. It had
     the right feel to it. It not only sounded right. It looked
     right too.

    -- GEORGE MELLY - "Owning Up" (1965)

    People have been making merry on Eel Pie Island since Victorian
    times and before...

    "It had come to pass that afternoon that Miss Morleena Kenwigs had
     received an invitation to repair next day, per steamer
     from Westminster Bridge unto Eel Pie Island at Twickenham: there
     to make merry upon a cold collation, bottled beer, shrub and
     shrimps, and to dance in the open air to the music of a
     locomotive band..."

    -- CHARLES DICKENS - "Nicholas Nickleby" (1839)


    When local antique dealer Michael Snapper bought the old and gently
    decaying Eel Pie Island Hotel in the early 1950's the locomotive
    band had been replaced by "a rather washed-out trio playing
    foxtrots and what-not to half a dozen people." Business at the
    hotel was very slow and locals were beginning to talk of Snapper's
    acquisition as a white elephant. The hotel badly needed renovation,
    the entertainment wasn't attracting anybody and worse of all - the
    only way you could get there was by a small ferryboat. Although he
    may not have realised it at the time what Mr Snapper needed to
    save his hotel was a) something that would attract large numbers
    of people, b) ideally people who wouldn't be too bothered by the
    tatty decor of his hotel and c) people who would really 'dig' the
    fun of a ferry boat ride. The answer was right under his nose.

RICHMOND LOCAL HISTORY SOCIETY 2013/14 LECTURE SERIES
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Richmond Local History Society is kicking off its new season
    of lectures and other events on subjects of local historical
    interest with a talk on Shrovetide football.

    Christopher May, the Society's new Chair, will speak about The
    death of an ancient manly sport: Shrovetide football in Richmond
    and vicinity on Monday, 21 October 2013. His talk is at the Duke
    Street (Baptist) Church, Duke Street, Richmond TW9 1DH, starting
    at 8pm, with coffee available from 7.30. The talk is free
    to members. Visitors are welcome: admission 2. pounds

    Christopher May said:

    "Two hundred years ago games of football were traditionally played
     on Shrove Tuesday though the main streets of Richmond, Twickenham,
     Mortlake, Kingston and other places nearby. This was not football
     as we know it today with its marked out pitch, its limited number
     of players and its set of rules -- both soccer and then rugby only
     got their rules half a century later. Shrovetide football was
     unruly, rough and tumble, boisterous and drunken. The gentry
     thought it uncivilised; shopkeepers deplored the damage and the
     loss of business; so the local authorities tried it suppress it,
     but it would take them several decades and changes in the law and
     policing for them to kill the game and stop the labouring classes
     taking over the town for one day of carnival every year."

THE BIG SPEAR SNOOZE - 8 NOVEMBER 2013
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    SPEAR is a local charity providing support for people who are
    homeless. We help people move off the streets and address the
    issues that may have led to their homelessness so they can start
    living a much better life.

    Our flagship event is The Big SPEAR Snooze where the community
    takes part in a sponsored sleepout to raise funds and awareness
    for our work. This year the sleepout is happening on Friday 8
    November at St Mary's Community Hall / Church in Twickenham.

    We are looking for people who would be willing to sleep outside
    for just one night to help those living without a home.

    There is supper and entertainment provided beforehand, and
    breakfast in the morning. Although it's a challenging event, we
    promise it's also very memorable and an experience you will
    never forget.

LOOKING FOR A BABYSITTER?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    I'm a 15 year old seeking babysitting and childminding jobs. I
    study at Orleans Park School and I am responsible, mature and
    reliable. I love working with kids and I can also work at short
    notice. I am happy to pick children up from Orleans Primary School
    or St Stephan's CE Primary School on Tuesdays through Fridays and
    bring them home. I can also do evening and weekend babysitting
    in the St Margarets area.

    Please don't hesitate to contact me with further questions or
    queries on 07564440158

JOIN INTERVIEW CIRCLES IN TWICKENHAM - AUTUMN 2013
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    The world premiere of Interview Circles, will be happening in
    Lulu'z cafe in Twickenham on Wednesdays in October and November
    2013 at 10 am.

    Would you love to be listened to. Here's your opportunity - so
    long as you can listen constructively to someone else.

    Interviewing is conversation when we focus on one person at a time.
    This allows them to develop ideas, share experiences, and develop
    skills as a presenter and raconteur. Meanwhile the interviewer is
    learning about people, how to put them at ease, help them develop
    and bring their experience to the common human experience.

    Might this help you prepare for a real-life situation, develop your
    plans, bounce your ideas off other people, overcome nasty
    experiences, and enjoy yourself, develop your network of contacts
    and make new friends as you do so?

    Drop in if you are interested.

ANOTHER ACCIDENT ON THE RIVER CRANE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Dismay as many fish die in River Crane pollution

    Shocked nature-lovers woke up this morning to discover the River
    Crane poisoned, leaving many fish dead once again.

    The Environment Agency was called following several reports that a
    section of the river at Twickenham had turned black and fish were
    in distress.

    The source of the pollution has been traced to an outfall pipe
    upstream of the A30.
