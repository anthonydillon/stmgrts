MEETING NOTES : POLICE LIAISON MEETING FROM 19 JULY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Sgt Arif Malik, PC Alan Richens, PCSO Lucy Burt and PCSO Eugenia 
    Venour met with some 25 local residents to discuss implementation 
    of the Safer Neighbourhoods initiative. Wendy Kyle-Pope, the 
    borough liaison between police and wards, whose remit is to 
    improve communications, chaired the meeting. Future meetings will
    be chaired by Dr Jenny Atton, who also chairs the Cole Park Road 
    Residents Association.
    
    The Safer Neighbourhood Team consists of six police and police 
    community support officers, whose aim is to address the 
    community's key concerns. The meeting was set up to define 
    these concerns, seek understanding of the background to them
    from residents, and discuss the most practical ways of 
    tackling them.

BRUNNEL SITE : NEW OCTAGON PLANNING PROPOSAL
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Octagon, the developers of the Brunnel Site have submitted a 
    planning proposal to remove the 18th century water feature 
    in front of Gordon House and replacing it with two small ponds, 
    a road and a large paved area.  The paved area appears to be 
    for parking, instead of the previously planned and obviously more 
    expensive underground parking.
    
    Many local resident groups are opposing this application.

HOLIDAY MULTI-SPORTS CAMP AT MOORMEAD
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Richmond Council is running a series of sports camps around the
    borough, a few are being run at Moormead.  Children aged between
    8 and 14 years can take part. Sports included are tennis, 
    swimming, softball, football, cricket, basketball, trampolining, 
    gymnastics and golf.  The emphasis of the camps is on fun but all
    sports will include some element of coaching, with the exception
    of swimming which is purely a fun session.  All sports are
    suitable for both boys and girls.  All camps run
    from 10.00am - 3.00pm. 
    
    The courses at Moormead are:
    
        Football only — Mon 24 Jul - Fri 28 Jul
        Football only — Mon 7 Aug - Fri 11 Aug
        Tennis, football and softball — Mon 21 Aug - Fri 25 Aug


    Apparently 2 more children are needed to ensure the football 
    camp runs, so call 020 8831 6107 or e-mail leisure@richmond.gov.uk today.

TESCO COMMENTS ON CHANGES TO DELIVERIES
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Councillor Ben Khosa has been in contact with Tesco regarding 
    their deliveries to the St Margarets Road Tesco Express 
    to understand and see if there could be further adjustments.  
    
    The following was the Tesco response:
    
        "We have reduced the size of the delivery vehicles
         we use.
         
         We originally used 16.5 metre vehicles - which are 
         full size.
         
         We now deliver fresh food every morning on a 10 metre 
         rigid.  Occasionally if volumes are great we would use 
         an artic with a 14 metre trailer.  I would stress this 
         is not a regular occurence, but is still smaller than 
         the original vehicle used.
         
         The grocery delivery which happens on Monday - Saturday 
         afternoons is done from a small box van, again unless 
         there is a huge spike in volumes when we would then 
         move to a 10ft rigid vehicle for this.
         
         We did look at consolidating the deliveries further 
         but due to volumes of goods involved it was 
         not possible."
