<p><em>18 December 2008</em></p>

<p>Welcome to the St Margarets Community Website Newsletter (<a href="https://stmargarets.london">stmargarets.london</a>). Occasional Thursdays we will send you the latest news and events from the website.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2008/12/i_told_bob_dylan_he_was_dead.html">I Told Bob Dylan He was Dead</a></h3>

<div class="box">Local residents might care to note that the following story  - which is absolutely true - has nothing whatsoever to do with St. Margarets. The only connection is the writer now lives in St. Margarets. At the time that the story is set he had never heard of the place!  Thank you.</div>

<p><img src="https://stmargarets.london/assets/images/2008/bobdylan_nashvilleskyline-thumb.jpg" width="150" height="136" alt="Nashville Skyline"  align="right" style="padding: 2px; border: 1px solid #ccc;" /></p>

<p>In the summer of 1969 I told Bob Dylan he was dead. He hadn&#8217;t heard the news at the time but he didn&#8217;t appear to be too bothered. Perhaps, like the rest of us who had made it through the Sixties, Bob had become inured to rock deaths - including his own. Since Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper had died in that plane crash in February 1959 a whole gang of rockers had joined the great tour bus in the sky - Eddie Cochran, Otis Redding, the Bar-Kays, Brian Jones, Johnny Kidd, Sam Cooke, Bobby Fuller, Johnny Burnette, Joe Meek, Frankie Lymon and countless others. There was one major difference however. They really were dead and Bob Dylan wasn&#8217;t but it didn&#8217;t matter. The story going round in the summer of &#8216;69 said he was and the rumour carried just enough fact to make it seem plausible.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2008/12/recipe_spicy_turkey_jambalaya.html">Recipe: Spicy Turkey Jambalaya</a></h3>

<p><img src="https://stmargarets.london/assets/images/2008/Spicy_Turkey_Jambalaya-thumb.jpg" width="150" height="112" alt="Steaming Plate of Spicy Turkey Jambalaya"  align="right" style="padding: 2px; border: 1px solid #ccc;" /></p>

<p>We are adding back a feature we attempted to start <a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2005/08/recipe_st_marga.html">back in August 2005</a>, a regular recipe.  Here is one perfect for your Christmas leftovers.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Christmas is soon approaching and many of us will be sitting down in a little less than a week to a huge turkey dinner.  For the cooks in the family, the turkey dinner is a true feat of ability.  Trying to get the turkey nicely browned, the sprouts perfectly cooked, the potatoes roasted to crispiness, all while keeping the in-laws and children at bay, truly requires immense planning and timing abilities and tests the skill of even the most talented chef.  It&#8217;s no wonder then that after Christmas dinner is over, the cook is exhausted and ready to throw the turkey some place where it will never been seen again!  Don&#8217;t do it!  There are so many brilliant ways of using those turkey leftovers that aren&#8217;t just boring sandwiches and microwaved leftovers.  My absolute favourite way of using turkey leftovers is to make a hearty jambalaya full of spices and vegetables.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://stmargarets.london/directory/wine_aNd_spirits/200511281416">The Good Wine Shop</a> is an Independent Wine Merchant based in St Margarets, south west London. Since 1999 we have built a reputation locally for sourcing interesting, good value and often quirky wines from some of the worlds best small producers. Big high street brands and supermarket wines aren&#8217;t really our thing, however that doesn&#8217;t mean we only sell expensive wine. There are wines in our range for all budgets but quality is never sacrificed.</p>

<p>Having managed to successfully establish our business locally we wanted to spread our wings onto the internet and see if wine lovers further a field would respond as well to the range of wines as our local customers do. We personally select all of the wines offered, a number of which we ship direct from the cellar door in Europe. Our aim is to offer the same service and personal touch to a wider audience in the UK via the internet.</p>

<p>Have a browse through our collection of Christmas cases &amp; wines or simply use our wine search to narrow the options. We&#8217;re sure you&#8217;ll be able to find something that hits the spot!</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2008/12/congratulations_for_the_christmas_fair.html">Thank you for the Christmas Fair</a></h3>

<p><img src="https://stmargarets.london/assets/images/2008/="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3107/3108197723_235b0ab452.jpg" alt="Christmas Fair" height="113" width="150"  align="right" style="padding: 2px; border: 1px solid #ccc;" /></p>

<p>Congratulations and thanks to all those who helped organise and run this year&#8217;s Crown Road Christmas Fair.  And to all the volunteers who manned stalls and helped make it run so smoothly.  The weather wasn&#8217;t always looking so good, but it held and hundreds of people where able to enjoy the night.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2008/12/event_reminder_harvey.html">Event Reminder: Harvey</a></h3>

<p><img src="https://stmargarets.london/assets/images/2008/="/assets/images/events/rss_harvey_thumb.jpg" width="150" height="112" alt="Harvey" align="right" style="padding: 2px; border: 1px solid #ccc;" /></p>

<p>Veta Louise and her daughter Myrtle Mae have arranged an afternoon party &#8212; hoping to find an an ideal husband for Myrtle. But things go horribly wrong when Uncle Elwood P Dowd drops in with his best friend Harvey &#8212; a 6&#8217; 1&#8221; white rabbit invisible to everyone else.</p>

<p>And as their party plans go progressively down the rabbit hole, the baffled family resolves to commit Uncle Elwood to the local mental hospital.</p>

<p>Come to the Richmond Shakespeare Society&#8217;s Mary Wallace Theatre, Twickenham for a madcap masterpiece of merriment and mayhem as Elwood and his bunny chum dispel the despair of the credit crunch in this beautifully written play by Mary Chase.</p>

<p><em>And, on the way, teach us a thing or two about Life&#8230;</em></p>

<p>Director John Gilbert says: &#8220;The play works best in the period in which it&#8217;s written, so we&#8217;re conjuring up a world that hints at but doesn&#8217;t precisely copy late 1940s America, with references to the film culture so vital at that time.To do this we&#8217;re working with students from the London College of Fashion on some marvellous makeup to go with the wonderful costumes.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;In 1950 Harvey became a memorable film starring James Stewart. As Elwood shares his &#8230; well, idiosyncratic outlook, its Pulitzer Prize credentials still sparkle through just as superbly. We expect it to become this year&#8217;s top pre-Christmas present, and given its likely popularity, we&#8217;ll be performing 10 shows rather than our usual eight.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://stmargarets.london/event/play/200705142016">Harvey runs from December 12th</a> to 20th at 7.45pm (Sun 14th 4pm, matinees Sats 13th &amp; 20th 3pm, no show Weds 17th). Box office 020 8744 0547 for bookings, membership and more details.</p>
