MARBLE HILL PLAYCENTRES RE-OPENING 7TH APRIL
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Marble Hill Playcentres are re-opening on April 7th and are the 
    only open access Adventure Playground (and only under 6's drop in 
    open in the holidays) in the Richmond borough. We have funding 
    to offer free season tickets to families on a low income or who 
    have children with special needs.
    
    The Adventure Playground is open for outdoor adventurous fun 
    on fabulous rope swings, aerial runway, nest swing and trampoline.
    The fun packed play programme will include arts and crafts, karaoke,
    sports and games, BBQ's, sports, music and drama.  No need to pre
    book-just turn up! For children and young people aged 5-15 years.

CAR CLUB IDEA FOR ST MARGARETS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Thought I'd suggest an idea which will hopefully help the parking
    issue around St Margarets.  www.streetcar.co.uk is a self-service 
    pay-as-you-go car hire company, where cars are available for rent 
    by the hour, day, week or month in your local area 24/7.  They 
    have dedicated parking spots, and I'm aware of cars in East 
    Twickenham, Richmond and Twickenham.
    
    It would be great if we could get a few around St Margarets and 
    those that don't need their cars as often can get rid of them. We 
    certainly use it and sold our 2nd car.
    
    Unfortunately streetcar makes arrangement with companies or 
    individuals to place these cars on their property with public
    access. In the St Margarets area there are probably very limited 
    much opportunities, so the council will probably have to agree 
    dedicated parking spots on the street.
    
    Anyone else think that this will work?

FITNESS TIPS AND CLASS TIMES FROM GEOLIFESTYLE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
     I have been running my personal training and fitness business 
     for the last five years. I currently run group running sessions
     during the week. These workouts are varied and focus on improving
     fitness levels. You do not need to be an experienced runner
     to manage one of these sessions, but just keen to improve 
     your fitness.
     
      -- from Georgie Islip at GeoLifestyle
      
      Top fitness tips
      
      1. Book exercise into your diary as an appointment,
         as it means you are    less likely to miss it.
      2. If you decide you are going to exercise first thing 
         in the morning, put your kit out so that it is the first
         thing you see in the morning and you have no excuse!
      3. If you are just starting out running, then walking first 
         for 4-6 minutes and then pick up running for 1-2 minutes. 
         Repeat for 20-30 minutes. Build up slowly so you run 
         for longer each week.
      4. Do not increase your training by more than 10% per week 
         as this can lead to injuries.
      5. If you are keen to improve your running then once a week 
         during an easy run add in 4-6 hard 60 second pickups. 
         Increase your pace to a hard effort and then run easy
         for about 4 minutes. Concentrate on your running technique,
         during these hard efforts, and focus on being light 
         on your feet.
      6. If you have 40-60 minutes to exercise each week, 
         do 2-3 20 minutes easy runs whilst focusing 
         on running smoothly.
      7. If you have 90 minutes each week, then do 2 30 minute
         runs and 1 20 minute run with 10 minutes of strength 
         training at the end.
      8. If you have 120 minutes per week, then try 2 20 minute 
         runs, 1 40 minute run, and 2 20 minute strength training.

    Please can you help, I have lost my cat, Benny.

    missing from the Turks Head end of Winchester Road on Thursday
