ï»¿HOW OBSERVANT ARE YOU?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    "When Baden Powell was a schoolboy at Charterhouse he would often
     play truant and hide in the woods. His masters could never find
     him, not because he was particularly well hidden, but because they
     didn't know how to look."

    Two weeks ago a group of 150 local Cub Scouts, aged 8 - 10, took
    part in an 'I-Spy' Hike, up one side of the Thames to Hammerton's
    Ferry and back down the other, to Richmond Lock. On the way they
    had to answer some questions that could only be solved by looking
    around and being observant.

    So, how observant are you? How well do you know the area in which
    we live? Do you see but not notice? Here are some of the questions
    that the Cubs had to consider:-

    1.  What does the automatic machinery on Richmond Lock sometimes do?
    2.  When was the iron railway bridge at Richmond built?
    3.  Outside the gateway into Richmond Palace is one of the oldest
    4.  pillar boxes in the world. It is called an "anonymous cylindrical".
    5.  Why does it have this name?
    6.  There is a sign painted on the wall of the 'Slug and Lettuce'
    7.  in Richmond saying "F L 7.1.1928". What does it mean?
    8.  How long does the return boat trip to Teddington Lock take?
    9.  What is remarkable about the plane tree outside 'Gaucho' on
    10.Richmond Riverside?
    11. What is the name of the statue on the lawn in Buccleugh Gardens?
    12. Where would you find 'Bulbous Betty'?
    13. Within 100 metres of Marble Hill House are two underground
        constructions. What are they?
    14. According to the harbour master what is the speed limit at
        Richmond Bridge?
    15. The senior surviving officer on the Titanic once lived on Ducks
        Walk. What was his name?
    16. Between Twickenham Bridge and the railway bridge, on both sides
        of the river, are two brick turrets sitting on top of mounds. What
        do you think that they are there for?
    17. About 100 yards from Twickenham Bridge is a brass marker set in the
        pavement on Ranelagh Drive. What is it pointing at?

ST MARGARETS PUB REOPENS - 11 OCTOBER 2012
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    After a major three week refurbishment, which will seem a bit
    like 'changing rooms' when the doors open! The interior has
    undergone a stunning makeover. Wooden flooring throughout, lovely
    wall lamps, striking chandeliers, and a cool and stylish wallpaper
    and paintwork combination.

    The toilets have been totally transformed (huge sighs of relief all
    round!) and the bar has been cleaned up, new fonts fitted and the
    back bar revamped. We will have five real ales on, with a focus
    on London beers; particularly products from Twickenham Brewery. The
    terrace has also been smartened up and new furniture installed.

    The major job, however, has been fitting out a new kitchen. Out
    with the banks of microwaves and deep fat fryers, and in with a
    equipment capable of producing freshly made, seasonal dishes. The
    menu will be predominantly British, but with some interesting
    twists and influences.
