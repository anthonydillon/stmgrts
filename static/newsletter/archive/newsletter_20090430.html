<p><em>30 April 2009</em></p>

<p>Welcome to the St Margarets Community Website Newsletter (<a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk">www.stmgrts.org.uk</a>). Occasional Thursdays we will send you the latest news and events from the website.</p>


<h2>Latest News</h2>



<!-- start include file /home/stmargarets/html/static/newsletter/news_story.incl -->



<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2009/05/stewart_and_martha.html">Stewart and Martha</a></h3>

<p><img src="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/assets/images/2009/allsouls_inside-thumb.jpg" width="150" height="98" alt="THE INTERIOR OF ALL SOULS"  align="right" style="padding: 2px; border: 1px solid #ccc;" /></p>

<p>One of the more interesting and perhaps alarming aspects of local history is just when you think the story is done and tucked away into the archives it suddenly jumps out again and surprises you. This is the case with Stewart Headlam whose anarchic story was <a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2009/04/the_turbulent_priest_from_st_peters_road.html">recorded in this newsletter two weeks ago</a>.</p>

<p>Readers of the article will remember that local minister Stewart Headlam (1847-1924) was a renegade Christian Socialist who preached that the church&#8217;s role was to help the poor and oppressed. The Bishop of London eventually banned<br />
Headlam from preaching when he claimed that Jesus Christ was a revolutionary.<br /><br /><br />
During his life Headlam was a staunch defender of anyone who had offended the stuffy guardians of respectability. In 1885 when Oscar Wilde was tried for &#8216;gross indecency&#8217; Headlam supported him and put up half of his &#163;5,000 bail.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/assets/images/2009/models-thumb.jpg" width="150" height="100" alt="models"  align="right" style="padding: 2px; border: 1px solid #ccc;" /></p>

<p>One of the recent highlights at Parvinu was a Lingerie and Swimwear fashion show held in aid of <a href="http://www.bowelcancer.tv">Lynn&#8217;s Bowel Cancer Campaign</a></p>

<p>The show was hosted by Susana Lorena who owns and runs SL Privee, a lingerie shop on Richmond Hill. It was a packed house and we were delighted to support the event and play our part by assisting with the setting, the music, light bites and crisp cold prosecco, all of which helped the evening really go off with a bang.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/assets/images/2009/charitycheque1-thumb.jpg" width="150" height="108" alt="big check"  align="right" style="padding: 2px; border: 1px solid #ccc;" /></p>
