<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2007/11/interview_manjusha_malhotra_of_st_margarets_kumon.html">Interview: Manjusha Malhotra of St Margarets Kumon</a></h3>

<p><strong>Why did you choose St Margarets to open a <a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/directory/school/200709280322">Kumon centre</a> ?</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>Kumon carries out extensive surveys and research to decide where the demand is for supplementary education.  I chose St Margarets because it&#8217;s close to where I live and I like the community atmosphere where everyone knows one another.  That is so rare to find in London.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Why did you want to do Kumon?</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>My son, my two nieces in Delhi and a nephew and niece in Virginia all do Kumon so I have seen how successful it can be.  The two in America have been studying Kumon for a long time; in fact they&#8217;ve grown up with it.  They are way ahead of their classes in maths.  I see how well they are all doing, not only academically but also in their confidence and attitude.  They take pride in their own achievements and are competitive with each other.</p></blockquote>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2007/11/chateau_st_margarets.html">Chateau St Margarets</a></h3>

<p>I have just finished reading an article in the Indie about a group of Tooting residents who are having the crop from their grapes made into their own local vintage. In it Richard Sharp of Tooting writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Last summer, I collected a bucket of grapes from my own vines and took them to the annual pressing at Bookers Vineyard in Bolney, West Sussex. Bookers sits on a hill that was part of the Butting Hill One Hundred, listed in the Domesday Book. Over the next five years, the vineyard will produce up to 80,000 bottles, and it is one of the few vineyards that offer pressings for those growing grapes in their gardens and smallholdings. Sam Linter, the vineyard&#8217;s manager, says: &#8220;It is a highlight of the harvest to see these small producers bringing their grapes in, full of anticipation for the wine they will receive back, but also it is a slightly frightening responsibility.&#8221; My own harvest was modest compared with some of the other Sussex and Kent growers. I decided there and then that 2007 would be the year when I recruited more grape growers in my neighbourhood of Furzedown to make urban wine with.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
