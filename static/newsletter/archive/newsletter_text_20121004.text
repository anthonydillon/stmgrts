THE ISLEWORTH MONA LISA
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    In 1913, a 40 year old art collector called Hugh Blaker was looking
    through a dusty art collection in a manor house in Somerset when he
    made a remarkable discovery. Hanging on the wall, unnoticed for 100
    years, was a portrait of a young woman which appeared in almost
    every respect to be a youthful version of Leonardo Da Vinci's
    masterpiece, the Mona Lisa. Her serene face and gentle smile were
    of a woman about 10 years younger than in the original, but the
    pose, the right hand resting on the left - a sign of a virtuous
    wife - was the same as was the style of dress. The only outstanding
    difference was the newly discovered picture was painted on canvas
    while the original was on a poplar board. The backgrounds were
    almost different. The young 'Mona Lisa' had columns to left and
    right and a rather sombre landscape behind. The older Mona Lisa,
    now hanging in the Louvre, was against an open and finely painted
    vista showing a road, a river and a bridge. The overall sense
    of tranquillity in both paintings was the same - as if both were
    painted by the same hand.

ANY POKEMON (CARD GAME) PLAYERS IN THE ST MARGARETS AREA?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
   
    We have a son who is very, very interested in Pokemon... but all
    the leagues are pretty far away. Are there any interested people
    out in Richmond Borough? Perhaps we could set up a casual,
    regular game?

    If so, please email: pokemon@stmgrts.org.uk

THE HOLLY LODGE CENTRE 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    'special needs in a special place'

    The Holly Lodge Centre based in Richmond Park is run totally
    by volunteers and one paid employee, the Project Manager Dr Pat
    Ealey, MBE. The Centre provides activities for people of all ages
    and abilities to help them learn about the natural environment and
    heritage of Richmond Park while having fun. Seventy per cent of the
    visiting groups have special needs.

    The Centre was officially opened in 1994 and since then it has
    grown amazingly - a Victorian classroom has been developed as well
    as a Victorian kitchen garden, A Victorian pharmacy, 'Mr Philip
    Palmer Chymist' was officially opened in January 2011 by our Royal
    Patron, HRH Princess Alexandra. There is a nature trail, dipping
    ponds, a picnic area adorned with a colourful mural depicting life
    in the park and a small stage.

    A wide range of activities are available to groups of visitors -
    pill and powder making, storytelling, a Victorian Dame School,
    animal habitats, the countryside code, to mention a few. We are
    currently developing a drug education programme.

    The Holly Lodge Centre holds several fundraising events a year
    but the most important is in November, which this year is a
    Swinging 60's Party. The Counterfeit Beatles and a disco will be
    playing the dance music. A buffet supper will be provided and a 60s
    quiz, auction and raffle will add to the entertainment.
