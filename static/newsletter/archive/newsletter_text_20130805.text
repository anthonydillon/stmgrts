EVENT REMINDER: SUMMER DRAMA WORKSHOP - 19 TO 23 AUGUST 2013
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Do you have children who enjoy drama? If so, we are delighted that
    once again we will be running our Summer Drama Workshop from 19th
    August to the 23rd August at Feltham Community College (Drama
    Studio), Browells Lane, Feltham TW13 7EF.

    This drama workshop is open to all children aged 5 to 18 years and
    will include some singing and movement.

    This summer course has been running in Feltham for several years
    now, and thanks to the generous sponsorship from the London Borough
    of Hounslow costs just 15.00 for Juniors, ages 5 to 10 and only
    20 pounds for Seniors, ages 11 to 18. This is the cost for the whole
    week!!!!
