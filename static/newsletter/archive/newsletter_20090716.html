<p>Welcome to the St Margarets Community Website Newsletter (<a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk">www.stmgrts.org.uk</a>). Occasional Thursdays we will send you the latest news and events from the website.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2009/07/the_skeeter_menace_of_1935.html">The Skeeter Menace of 1935</a></h3>

<p><img src="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/skeeter-thumb.png" width="150" height="111" alt="skeeter" align="right"/></p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;They rise like columns of smoke from the woods over there, and sometimes stretch above the trees. We have to close the windows and draw the curtains to have a chance of keeping them out. There are swarms of the pests about and it is time something was done about it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>In early June 1935 St Margarets, Twickenham, Whitton and parts of Richmond and Hounslow were under attack from an insect invasion that was filling doctors&#8217; waiting rooms with scratching victims and driving local ratepayers to distraction. The enemy was from the family Culicidae - the Mosquito.</p>

<p>Local Health Committees, aware of the nuisance, were taking the infestation seriously - but as their spokesman  Dr. <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">G.H</span></span></span> Dupont commented, &#8220;The mosquitoes are more of an annoyance than a serious menace to health&#8221;. A reporter from the Richmond and Twickenham Times disagreed.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Let me say at once that there have been no exaggerations in the reports that have filtered through from the battle front. The mosquitoes are winning all along the line and people living in the areas under fire have their backs to the wall.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><img src="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/stm_pano-thumb.jpg" width="300" height="39" alt="panorama of the Fair" /></p>

<p>In spite of us not providing the normal rainless baking hot day for this year&#8217;s St Margarets Fair, your support was as always tremendous.  We&#8217;ll know the exact amount of money raised for the schools and charities in September, but even given the weather it looks like being at least as much as last year.  Thank you all very much.  Although the money is important we always strive to primarily ensure that the Fair is an event for all ages and flavours of the Community.</p>

<p>If you <a href="http://www.stmargaretsfair.org/Gallery2009/index.html">visit our website</a> you&#8217;ll find some photographs taken at this year&#8217;s Fair.  And if you&#8217;re looking for any lost property please contact Julia Kirkpatrick on 020 8241 1042, who may be able to re-unite with a treasured possession.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2009/07/north_st_margarets_big_lunch.html">North St Margarets&#39; Big Lunch</a></h3>

<p>On Sunday 19<sup>th</sup> July residents of North St Margarets, the bit past the Ailsa Tavern, will be linking up with All Souls Church and sitting down to a <a href="http://stmgrts.org.uk/event/fair/200705142185">Big Lunch</a> together.</p>

<p>The Big Lunch is a national event organised by the Eden Project to encourage neighbours and communities to share lunch on one day of the year. So <a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/directory/group/200506300538">North St Margarets Residents&#8217; Association</a> together will <a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/directory/church/200506080805">All Souls Church</a> thought it would be a great opportunity for a <em>Street Party</em>. One end of Northcote Road will be closed off and residents are being asked simply to bring some food and drink to share and turn up. There will be a marquee, live music, a bouncy castle, street chalk pictures and face painting and lots more - in fact, all the fun of a party!</p>

<p>Residents&#8217; Association committee member Judy Maciejowska said:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;When we first heard about the Big Lunch we thought it was too good an opportunity to miss. We have a smashing community here in St Margarets, and a street party with locally produced food is another good way to meet people you may not bump into everyday. It&#8217;s shaping up to be a really great event and it looks as if the rain will keep away. It&#8217;s good also to be working with All Souls Church, and they&#8217;ve offered us use of the church if the heavens do open!&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2009/07/the_rising_sun_pub_reopens.html">The Rising Sun Pub Reopens</a></h3>

<p>This pub has reopened as the <a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/directory/pub/200611051507">Rising Sun/Marble Hill</a> a &#8216;food led pub&#8217; under new management which is &#8216;open all day offering freshly cooked food, great ales/beers and specially selected wines&#8217;. The new tenant is Jamie McCarthy of Marble Hill [UK] Ltd, which is said to be backed by Chinese restaurateurs. I have a report of a friendly welcome the other day but have not yet been in myself. The website has not yet been updated. The pub has lost its entertainments licence so it is no longer a music venue.</p>

<p>Residents, including children, are invited to a drinks evening at 6 pm on Sunday July 26. <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">RSVP </span></span></span>to: <a href="mailto:%6D%61%72%62%6C%65%68%69%6C%6C%70%75%62%40%79%61%68%6F%6F%2E%63%6F%2E%75%6B">marblehillpub@yahoo.co.uk</a> or just turn up. They say that &#8216;this drinks evening will be a great opportunity to voice any previous concerns and how can work closely together into the future&#8217;.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2009/07/superdrug_changing_morning_deliveries.html">Superdrug Changing Morning Deliveries</a></h3>

<p>I recently wrote to Superdrug regarding their new, and rather anti-social, habit of delivering during the morning school run (which is expressly prohibited) using extra large lorries, and parking right up to the corner of Broadway Avenue, causing an obstruction and severely impeding the sight line of anyone crossing, or turning left.  I backed this up with some photos gained from 15 minutes of observation.</p>

<p>Superdrug responded immediately, and have come back with this response, which, if it is followed through, is excellent, and I think is to be applauded.  Would you mind publishing this to show that not all of our neighbours are bad neighbours&#8230; And to ask that residents keep an eye out to see what is going on!</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2009/07/meeting_notice_school_conversion_plans_turks_head.html"><span class="caps">MEETING NOTICE</span>: School Conversion Plans @ Turks Head - 22nd July 2009</a></h3>

<p>Nigel Cannings, a local resident with children at Orleans and St Stephen&#8217;s, has arranged a meeting for all parents to discuss the proposed conversion of Orleans and St Stephen&#8217;s into two form entry primary schools.</p>

<p>His hope is that a community-wide consensus can be reached on what parents want to see happen with their local schools, and that acting in concert, the views of residents might be heard.</p>

<p>The Turk&#8217;s Head has kindly allowed the use of Winchester Hall, just by St Stephen&#8217;s, next Wednesday, 22<sup>nd</sup> July at 7.30pm, and all parents and other concerned residents are invited to attend.</p>

<p>Nigel can be contacted at <a href="mailto:%6E%69%67%65%6C%63%61%6E%6E%69%6E%67%73%40%67%6D%61%69%6C%2E%63%6F%6D">nigelcannings@gmail.com</a></p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2009/07/schools_bulging_across_richmond_borough.html">Schools Bulging Across Richmond Borough</a></h3>

<p>As most parents with primary aged children already know from various meetings with Richmond Council, next year the Council needs to create some seven additional reception classes across the borough.  Locally  Orleans Infant School, St Mary&#8217;s CE Primary School and Chase Bridge Primary School are all going to take an additional class.  It appears there are still 50 children in the <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">TW1 </span></span></span>postcode without places.  According to Matthew Paul, Deputy Head of Commissioning, Delivery and Service Improvement;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;This year, due in part to the recession, demand has increased to the point that the shortfall in places compared with normal capacity of 1,937 is over 200. We have therefore provided seven additional reception classes across the borough, including one each at Chase Bridge Primary and at Orleans Infant. The take-up rate from birth (i.e. the number of children born in the area, plus those who have moved in, whose parents want state school places for them) has increased this year from 70% to 78%.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2009/07/comment_etiquette.html">Comment Etiquette</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2005/12/on_comments.html">Nearly four years ago I wrote a post on comments, spam and a recommended etiquette for this site</a> that I still believe is the right balance for creating an open forum with some accountability.  Admittedly, this is a difficult balance between encouraging people to speak freely and post easily and preventing unhelpful and unwanted remarks.  So I would like to reiterate the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Use your real name</strong> where possible. If you cannot for whatever reason, use the same pseudonym consistently so it doesn&Otilde;t appear that you are an angry mob.</li>
<li><strong>Use you real email address</strong> at all times <em>it isn&#8217;t published</em>, but let&#8217;s me know you are a real person.</li>
</ul>


<p>Remember, if you can&#8217;t say anything nice, don&#8217;t say anything.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2009/07/take_the_st_margarets_alliance_survey.html">Take the St Margarets Alliance Survey</a></h3>

<p><ins>Update</ins></p>

<p>ST <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">MARGARETS COMMUNITY SURVEY DEADLINE EXTENDED</span></span></span> TO <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">AUGUST</span></span></span> 14<sup>th</sup></p>

<p>The St Margarets Alliance have extended the deadline for completion of their Community Action Plan Survey.  The original deadline for completion of the Survey was Friday 17th July but, with Surveys still coming in at a steady rate, the Alliance believe an extension will be welcomed by participants.</p>


<div class="box">

<p><img src="http://www.stmargaretsalliance.com/imgs/logo1.jpg" alt="St Margarets Alliance" width="169" height="188" align="right" /></p>

<p>The St Margarets Alliance is <a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/sma_survey">asking all residents to complete a survey</a> as the first stage towards creating a Community Action Plan.  The Survey asks residents to consider which aspects of their local environment, economy, or social well-being are most important to them and to prioritise the most important and urgent.</p>

<p>Community Action Plans are central to the Sustainable Communities Act (SCA) of 2007, which aims to create a more local form of democracy.  The Plans are approved by the Secretary of State and funded from central government and community funds.  As such, Community Action Plans help communities to shape their economic, social and environmental well-being.</p>

<p><em>The group is non party-political and its purpose is to coordinate a Community Action Plan for the area. St Margarets Alliance does not have a specific agenda for the St Margarets area: the results of the Survey will form the basis for the basis of all future initiatives.  The group&#8217;s guiding principle is &#8216;residents first&#8217;.</em></p>
