HOW THE MOTORWAY NEARLY CAME TO ST MARGARETS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    In 1943, with a World War still to be won and victory far 
    from certain the Government commissioned a group of civil 
    engineers, architects and town planners to draw up plans for the 
    London that would be built once peace came. There was a lot to do.
    A third of the London housing stock was damaged and nearly
    1 1/2 million people were in need of homes. The group, working under
    Sir Patrick Abercrombie, produced two reports -- the County 
    of London Plan 1943 and the Greater London Plan 1944. These are
    staggering documents - for their detail, the breadth of their
    vision and above all their sheer optimism. At a time when Europe
    was firmly under the heel of the Nazi jackboot and peace and
    security seemed a forlorn hope Abercrombie and his team were
    envisaging an urban utopia - with new homes on smart estates, 
    large areas of open space for everyone to enjoy (4 acres of per 
    1000 people was the recommended standard), a 'green belt' to
    control urban sprawl and a network of urban roads and fast
    expressways connecting cities. Look at any modern road atlas and
    you will see Abercrombie's 1943 proposed scheme in actuality -- the 
    North and South Circular roads, the M25 orbital road and radiating
    out from the centre the now familiar motorways.
    
    The Abercrombie team planned 10 new major motorway routes. The 
    first, Route 1, connected London with Exeter and Plymouth via 
    Chertsey and followed the old Great Chertsey Road, the A316 as 
    we know it today. The original idea was for the new motorway to 
    come through St Margarets right into London where it would 
    connect with a new inner London ring road at Chiswick.

MARBLE HILL EVENT DAY CONTROLLED PARKING ZONE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    You may recall that last year the council introduced an Event Day
    Only Controlled Parking Zone (CPZ) in all roads situated within 
    East Twickenham controlled parking zone F and St Margarets South
    controlled parking zone S during the Marble Hill concerts.
    
    This year the English Heritage concert at Marble Hill Park will 
    take place on Saturday 23 August 2008 and Sunday 24 August 2008.
    The Council will once again operate the Event Day CPZ on these 
    two days between the hours of 5.30pm and 8pm in all roads within
    zones F and S.
    
    During the Event Day CPZ, parking controls will only apply to the
    following parking bays:
    
    * Resident permit holder bays
    * Resident / business (permit holder bays)
    * Business permit holder only bays.
    
    
    All other parking will not be controlled and will remain free.
    
    All current resident, business or operational permits, valid 
    in either zones F or S, are automatically valid in the Event
    Day CPZ.
