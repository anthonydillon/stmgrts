POST-CALL IN STATEMENT OF THE ST MARGARETS' CPZ EXTENSION
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    We condemn the decision confirmed at the recent meeting 
    of the Richmond Council's Environment Overview and Scrutiny
    Committee to include two more roads in the St Margarets' 
    CPZ because:
    
    1. It defies all normally understood principles of democracy 
       that a majority in these two roads of only 13 votes can trump
       over 300 against in the consultation area.
       It undermines the purpose of a consultation that confusing 
       information on procedures is given on the Council's website
       and in its literature.
       
    2. It compromises the electoral process that inadequate figures
       were available on which voters could base their decision, 
       e.g. the Council's Beat Survey, giving the full facts 
       on vehicles parked at different times in the area was 
       withheld (this showed that night time parking was worse 
       than daytime, so residents will be paying for nothing).
       
    3. In makes a mockery of the consultation that the Council's 
       database of addresses is flawed, so that a business park, 
       some flats and users of a service road adjacent to the new 
       CPZ extension were left out.  Consulting them now is 
       calculated to force them into the CPZ, when instead the 
       whole exercise should have been declared invalid.
       
    4. It is indicative of the Council's attitude to accuracy that 
       the committee Char, Cllr Mumford, should joke that a 
       questionnaire was sent to a bus stop in the Teddington CPZ
       consultation last year.
       
    5. It is absurd that representations from a single resident 
       that a further road should be included in the CPZ (with a
       majority of only one, originally considered insufficient
       by the Council) should receive sympathy and an assurance 
       of an early review, when serious concerns expressed
       by eight residents who spoke strongly against the CPZ 
       were largely dismissed.
       
    6. It is unacceptable that the Lib Dem majority on the committee
       should be satisfied with assurances from David Trigg, Cllr 
       for Transport, and from Council officials, that all requirement 
       had been met, when clearly they hadn't.
       
       
    We thank Cllrs Head and Hodgins for challenging the decision 
    on our behalf, and Cllr Seymour, Vice-Chair of the committee, 
    for supporting us.

TOSS OARS!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Even Kings and Queens like to get away to the country at the 
    weekend and their favourite way of getting there was by Shallop
    - an 8 oared pleasure barge with a comfy glass-sided, cabin in 
    which to chill out. Faster than walking and much more comfortable
    than riding in a coach, a well crewed shallop could get from 
    Greenwich to Hampton Court in about 4 hours. The trip would take
    longer if the boat stopped at Twickenham Ait for some of Mistress 
    Mayo's famous eel pies, a particular favourite with Henry VIII. 
    Shallops were the riparian version of the stretched limo. Fast,
    comfortable and stylish.
    
    In the past shallops were crewed by liveried oarsmen with years 
    of experience and bulging muscles. Last week it was the turn 
    of the boys of 1st St. Margarets Cub Pack with little experience 
    and no muscles. Their boat was the Royal Shallop "Jubilant", 
    owned by the Queen and looked after by the 14th Richmond Viking 
    Boating Centre. It was not going to be a simple paddle around 
    the bay. Rowing a shallop means learning orders - and obeying 
    them. (Novices should pay attention here just in case Her
    Majesty drops by for a quick trip up river)

COMMUNITY SPIRIT HELPS ST MARGARETS FAIR NET L14K
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    "Visitors got into the "true community feel" of the St Margarets 
    fair as they helped raise over L14,000 for charities and
    community projects.
    
    The 30th anniversary of the event, in Moor Mead Garden, was 
    celebrated by thousands - many of whom stayed into the evening 
    listening to the variety of bands who performed."

SCRUTINY COMMITTEE GIVES CPZ THE OK
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The meeting of the Environment & Sustainability Overview & 
    Scrutiny Committee on Thursday 17 July agreed to 'note' Cllr 
    Trigg's decision to extend the CPZ to Bridge and Winchester Roads.
    This means that the extension will be implemented without further 
    delay. Cllr Trigg has agreed:
    
      1. to review his decision to exclude Sidney Road 
         [which split 50/50] with a view to early inclusion;
         
      2. to re-consult The Mews; and
         
      3. to bring forward the review from 6 months to earlier 
         if need be; the area to be reviewed* is large and any new
         problem areas will be highlighted.
