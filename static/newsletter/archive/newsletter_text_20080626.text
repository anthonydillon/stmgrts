CHASE BUCHANAN TAKING PHILLIP HODGES OFFICES
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Chase Buchanan are delighted to announce that we've secured larger
    premises in St Margarets Village, for our expanding Sales and
    Lettings office.

    Our fellow Estate Agents at Phillip Hodges are relocating, and
    no longer require their premises at 124 St Margarets Road.  This
    has created an opportunity for us to move across the road, with
    minimal upheaval.  We have been keen to find a larger office
    in St Margarets for some time and this prominent site, opposite
    St Margarets station, is ideal. We are sure this will enable us
    to continue to work effectively in a comfortable environment.

    We will commence refurbishing our new sales and lettings office
    very soon, with the aim of opening in early September.

    If you have any queries please contact Michael Peacock
    on 020 8744 2434 or e-mail to m.peacock@chasebuchanan.co.uk.
