KAREN ASKEW PILATES CLASSES
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Running the classes locally since 2008 and booking new students
    in East Twickenham and Twickenham.

    In every session my aim is to teach a safe, effective and
    beneficial set of exercises that work for everyone in the group,
    modifying exercises to suit, if a person has a shoulder problem I
    will simplify the move until they are ready to move on. After each
    class I want you to feel you have worked your whole body but feel
    relaxed and stretched.
