    There is a common misapprehension that the only music the elderly
    enjoy is of the "Daisy Daisy" variety forgetting perhaps that
    today's generation of 70 and 80-year olds were not raised listening

    Skiffle. Today's Grey Panthers were yesterday's Teddy Boys and
    Dungaree Dolls and in their hearts they still are.
