Welcome to the St Margarets Community Website Newsletter. 
Each Thursday we will send you the latest news and events from the website (http://www.stmgrts.org.uk).

LATEST NEWS
===========================================================



BEWARE BOGUS 'CHARITIES' AND THIRD WORLD APPEALS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Residents regularly receive leaflets asking for items of clothing
    and household goods to be left for collection.
    
    It is estimated by the Association of Charity Shops that the 
    potential value of donated clothing and other items 'lost' 
    to legitimate charities as a result of these bogus 'charities' 
    collections amounts to over L1 million per annum. Many genuine 
    charities rely on such doorstep collections for a substantial 
    proportion of their shop sales.
    
    Not All Alleged Charities are Registered!
    
    If unsure the number on the leaflet can be checked with The Central 
    Register of Charities on 0845 3000 218 or online 
    at www.charity-commission.gov.uk.

PLAY REMINDER: HUMPTY DUMPTY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    THE EGG MAN COMETH
    
    It's panto time again (oh yes, it is!), and audiences young and 
    old will flock for an evening of Christmas magic and mirth as some 
    of theatre's best-loved characters don their makeup and tread 
    the boards.
    
    Among perennial favourites in the panto calendar is original 
    egg-man Humpty Dumpty, and this year there's no need to shell out
    a fortune on train fares (oh no, there isn't!) to witness 
    the fun.
    
    From 7th to 16th December the Richmond Shakespeare Society stages
    this evergreen Xmas classic right on the doorstep at the 
    eggscellent Mary Wallace Theatre beside the Thames at Twickenham, 
    and so the youngest fans don't miss their bedtime, there'll be 
    two Saturday matinees, not one.

EVENT REMINDER: MUSIC AT CHRISTMAS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Remember the Fancy a Good Sing article?  Well, despite being short
    a few tenors - hint, hint - the recently formed choir are ready 
    for a Christmas concert at Richmond College.
    
    The concert features choral, chamber music and jazz, performed
    by the Music Students, Community Choir and Jazz Band of Richmond 
    upon Thames College.  Works to be performed are by Monteverdi, 
    Pachelbel and Mozart.  Also choruses and solos from Handel's
    Messiah and a Jazz Programme.

LOCAL SCHOOLS LAUNCH COOKERY BOOK
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The PTAs at St Stephens Junior School and Orleans Infant School 
    have joined forces to produce a cookery book to raise funds 
    for their schools. Comprising 65 recipes from parents, governors 
    and teachers at the schools, Come and Get Its is lavishly 
    illustrated with children's drawings and is published on Friday
    December 1st.

    If you would like to order a copy of Come and Get It the St 
    Stephens and Orleans Infant Schools cookery book email Sherralyn

    retails at L12.

EVENT REMINDER: FIGHTING ALCOHOL & DRUGS SEMINAR
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The fight against alcohol and drugs misuse will be highlighted 
    at a seminar in York House on 12 December. 
    
    The event is being organised by the Richmond upon Thames Community
    Safety Partnership, a crime fighting alliance comprising Richmond

NO CHRISTMAS FAIR ON CROWN ROAD
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Sadly there will be no Christmas Fair in Crown Road this year.  
    The St Margarets Traders Association, who normally organises the 
    event, has decided to take a year off from hosting the event.  The
    fair is an enormous amount of work for the Traders Association and 
    requires coordination with the traders, local school PTAs, 
    Richmond Council, Met Police, fun fair people, craft stalls, 
    bands, street performers, street closure, insurance, lighting and 
    clean-up to name a few.  Hopefully next year the 
    tradition returns.

CPZ CONSULTATION IN ST MARGARETS DELAYED
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The consultation for the proposed Controlled Parking Zone [CPZ] 
    in St Margarets village will not start until late January at the
    earliest. The Council's Cabinet plans to decide at its meeting 
    on Monday, 15 January 2007, on the details of its new charging 
    scheme for CPZs, which is currently out to consultation (see 
    Consultation on emission based charging for parking permits and
    note the deadline for receipt of completed questionnaires and
    comments is 15 December 2006.)
    
    If all runs to plan, the consultation will start as soon as is 
    feasible after January 15 and will contain full details of the 
    charges that will apply if a CPZ is created. A legal challenge 
    to the new scheme (unlikely but possible) will delay 
    matters further.

ART DECO LONDON - LOCAL BOOK, LOCAL BARGAIN
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Art Deco London  written by local resident Colin Hines 
    with photographs by Paul Riddle and Keith Cheetham is the first 
    ever guide book to the 20's and 30's deco delights of the capital. 
    Its 60 pages contain 110 superb colour photographs and shows where 
    in London magnificent examples of art deco can be found, eaten and
    quaffed in, slept in, shopped in, and campaigned for. Its deco 
    delights range from 'palaces of the people' cinemas (many saved
    thanks to bingo), theatres, hotels, homes, shops, museums, a deco
    hospital and even a 'decover and out' crematorium.
    
    Local deco delights include Twickenham Bridge, Mortlake 
    Crematorium and the authors own 'Miami in Middlesex' 30's home.
    
    The book would make an excellent Christmas present for anyone 
    interested in architechture - think mini-coffee table book.

EXHIBITION REMINDER: LANDSCAPES - SEEN AND IMAGINED
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Currently running, there is a new joint exhibition featuring 
    recent paintings by local artists, Idun Eustace and Jane Butcher.

    Curator of Orleans House Gallery Mark De Novellis said: 
    "This is a very accomplished exhibition of work by local talent."

    The show runs through 14 January 2007.

LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD FOR SUNVIL'S NOEL JOSEPHIDES
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Noel Josephides, the co-founder of Sunvil Holidays, based in Old 
    Isleworth, Middlesex, has been awarded the British Guild of Travel
    Writers' highest honour, the 2006 Lifetime Achievement Award in
    recognition of his contribution to the world of travel, which 
    includes his pioneering campaign for 'green' tourism long before
    the concept was adopted by other sectors of the travel industry.
    
    Cyprus-born Josephides co-founded Sunvil Holidays, a small tour 
    operation to Cyprus, in 1973. The company was badly affected by 
    the Turkish invasion of 1974, but survived, expanded and now 
    produces ten brochures a year to a range of destinations 
    worldwide. Based in Isleworth, Middlesex, Sunvil has always 
    stayed true to its original mission to provide responsible, 
    low-volume, low-impact tourism to areas off the beaten track.
    When Josephides first started campaigning for 'green' tourism 
    in the early 1980s, the idea was both new and controversial.

    Church Hall.

EVENT REMINDER: CHRISTMAS SHOOTING STAR NIGHT
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    December will be ushered in with a special Shooting Start Winter 
    Party at the Turks Head on Friday 1st December in aid 
    of The Shooting Star Children's Hospice. This will definitely 
    put everyone in the mood for a festive Christmas period before 
    getting bogged down with all that Christmas shopping.
    
    With four terrific local Twickenham bands playing a wide range 
    of music, from Motown to Glamrock, it promises to be a 
    fun-filled evening. The headline act is  "The Shooting Ska 
    Allstars" playing their highly infectious blend of Reggae
    and Ska music.  "The Funk Bomb Detonators" kick off the evening
    with 60's Soul and Motown numbers and St Margarets' very own 
    "Doghouse"  will be playing a great selection of hits from 
    across the years. Glitter and platform heels will be the order
    of the day as  Glamrock band "Bulge" go on stage, celebrating 
    10 years since they debuted live for the first time, at the 
    Turk's Head.
    
    The bands are giving up their time for free to ensure that
    all the money raised on the night goes direct to the charity
    and Karen Peffer from Shooting Star is certainly looking 
    forward to it; "After the success of the first music night 
    that took place in March, we are delighted that this second
    event is taking place in St Margarets and we hope lots of 
    people will come and support us and enjoy the party!" 
    
    Tickets are L5 on the door and the music starts at 8.00 pm
