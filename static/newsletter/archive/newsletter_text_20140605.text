SHALLY WALLY, SHALLY WALLY, SHALLY WALLY ETC ETC...
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    At last it can be told. The true story of 'Ging Gang Gooli'
    (apparently) who wrote it and why (allegedly) , where it was first
    performed (possibly) and what it means (if anything)

    'Ging Gang Gooli' is one of those songs that is irrevocably linked
    with the Boy Scout movement although it has been covered by artists
    as disparate as The Scaffold, The Tremeloes, The Megatons, Karl
    Denver, The Rutles, Kim and Sandara, Inner Kneipe, Billy and Vhong
    plus Cubs, Scouts, Brownies and Guides around the world.

POLICE: COURIER FRAUD AWARENESS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Courier fraud is a sophisticated fraud where scammers telephone the
    victim purporting to be someone from their bank, the police or
    other law enforcement agency. They then dupe the person
    into revealing their PIN and handing over their credit or debit
    card to a courier or taxi driver, who may not know they are being
    used as part of the scam. The victim may be asked to ring the
    number on the back of their card, thereby further convincing the
    victim that the call is genuine, however the scammer keeps the line
    open so that the victim unknowingly talks to another member of the
    gang, posing as a bank employee.
