ï»¿EVENT REMINDER: ST MARGARETS FAIR - 14 JULY 2012
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Don't forget that this Saturday, 14 July 2011, from 12 - 7.45pm, is
    the 34th Annual St Margarets Fair in Moormead Park.

     - a full programme of entertainment throughout the day,
       starting with a popular children's '5-a-side' football tournament
       in the morning on Moormead.
     - During the afternoon there is a dog show on little Moormead
        across Hillview Road.
     - The musical entertainment runs all afternoon on the stage, and we
        moved the stage further away from the tea tent to help separate the
        'rock' from the rolls.
     - There are announcements, interviews and music throughout the day
        from Radio West Middlesex.

    The fair organisers run the Tea Tent, Beer Tent, Pimms Stall, the
    BBQ, the Bric-a-brac stall, the Silent Auction, and the Coconut
    Shy.

    All profits from these stalls go direct to our charities - please
    support these stalls. See how we spend the money.

REMEMBERED AT LAST
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    The story of a pilot in Bomber Command

    At 12.00 on Thursday 28th June the Queen unveiled a memorial
    honouring the 55,573 aircrew of Bomber Command who were killed
    during WW2 and all those who died in their attacks. On it
    is written...

    "The fighters are our salvation, but the bombers alone provide the
     means of victory."

     - WINSTON CHURCHILL


    Frank was my neighbour and friend. During the 2nd World War he was
    a pilot in Bomber Command flying Lancasters for 9 Squadron based
    at Bardney in Lincolnshire.

    are celebrating the opening of the new Twickenham Diamond Jubilee
    Gardens with an afternoon of writing, reading and poetry. This
    picturesque location along the Thames provides the perfect backdrop
    to work on your writing, enjoy guest readings from a number
    of London's finest writers or simply bring a book and pull up a
    deck chair over looking the river.

EVENT REMINDER: RFU STRAWBERRY HILL MUSIC/FUN DAY - 22 JULY 2012
---------------------------------------------------------------------
    On Sunday, 22 July 2012 the Rugby Football Union presents the
    annual Strawberry Hill Music and Family Fun Day in the grounds
    of the gothic house on Waldegrave Road, Twickenham. Over 7,000
    attended last year.

    As well as providing the community with a fun day out, the aim is
    to raise funds for the restoration of Strawberry Hill House.

    Once again there will be the popular live music stage, charity and
    craft stalls, children's rides and entertainment, beer and Pimms
    tents, food and refreshments. Why not bring a picnic and enjoy
    the day.

    From 12noon until 7.30pm the music stage will feature bands, mostly
    with a local connection:

     - Skalextric
     - The Mustangs
     - The Blue Meanies
     - Nark Drool and The Shudders
     - Marner Brown

    ... and others.

PLEASE SIGN A PETITION FOR A 20 MPH SPEED LIMIT NEAR ST MARYS SCHOOL
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Petition for 20 mph speed limit and other traffic mitigation in the
    vicinity of St Mary's School on Strafford Road, Twickenham.

    The opening of a new school in Strafford Road makes traffic
    mitigation imperative. Strafford Rd., Oak Lane and Amyand Park Rd.
    together function as a 'rat run', the only route between central
    Twickenham and central St Margaret's for drivers seeking to avoid
    congestion on Richmond Road (an 'A' road). With the support of the
    school's Governing Body, we request a speed limit of 20 mph
    in Strafford Rd.; pedestrian crossings across Strafford Rd., Amyand
    Park Rd., and Oak Lane; and other measures such as speed bumps or
    narrowings of the carriageway on Strafford Rd.

    Please sign the online petition now:  http://www.voiceregister.com/Traffic-mitigation-at-St-Marys-School-Twickenham

    leaks found on the water mains in Richmond Road area.

    We are due to start work Opposite 281 Richmond Road on Wednesday 27
    June and expect to take nine days to complete. We will move
    to Opposite 185 Richmond Road on Friday 6 July and expect to take

    to 6.00pm Monday to Friday, from 8am to 3.00pm on Saturday,
    from 8.30am to 2.00pm Sunday.

    Your water supply will not be affected by this work.

    that traffic disruption is kept to a minimum, but would like
    to apologise for any inconvenience our work may cause.
