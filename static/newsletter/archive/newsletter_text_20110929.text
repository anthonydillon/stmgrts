ï»¿THE COMING OF THE GIANTS - RICHMOND 1918
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    On the evening of 29th January 1918 three huge Zeppelin-Staaken
    R.VI Riesenflugzeug "Giant" bombers of the Luftstreitkraefte
    (Imperial German Air Service) took off from their base in Ghent,
    Belgium to attack London. The first plane ran into heavy
    anti-aircraft fire over Billericay and turned for home. It is not
    known where it dropped its bombs. The second 'Giant' was attacked
    by a night fighter over Tottenham in north London. It too decided
    to return home offloading its bombs near Wanstead. The third
    aircraft was also attacked near Hertford by a B.E 12 fighter flown
    by Capt. A Dennis of RFC 37 Squadron based at Goldhanger in Essex.
    This attack was unsuccessful and undamaged the 'Giant' turned south
    towards Brentford. Following the Thames towards its target the
    'Giant' dropped its bombs. The first stick fell on the Old Deer
    Park, Richmond. The others landed in Brentford, Kew Bridge Road and
    Chiswick. That night 10 people were killed and the same number
    injured. According to reports there was little material damage.

READING GROUPS IN RICHMOND LIBRARIES
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Explore new books! Discover new authors! Swap reading ideas in a
    friendly library environment!

    Richmond libraries are keen to support and encourage local reading
    groups. Reading groups are a good way to meet new people and share
    your passion for reading. They are a great way to try out a range
    of different books and authors, developing and challenging your
    reading habits. Groups can read anything from crime to poetry,
    graphic novels to classics, or focus on a particular genre.

DUCK POND MARKET COMES TO RICHMOND
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Duck Pond Market is launching in Richmond on October 23rd, and will
    be a weekly Sunday market, taking place in the beautiful setting
    of Heron Square, just off Richmond (Bridge) Road, George Street and
    the riverside. Entrance is free, and the market will be open
    10.30am - 3.30pm every Sunday. We'd love to see you there!

    New mum-preneur Caron Pook started the Duck Pond Market in Ruislip
    with just 38 stalls in 2008 as a way to bring her passion
    for ethically-sourced products, organic foods and local community
    together in a fun, friendly and beautiful environment. Over the
    past three years, it's gone from strength to strength, attracting
    market-goers from all over London and gathering interest from local
    councils and national media. Duck Pond is now a thriving local
    market, boasting over 100 quality stalls, with more joining every
    month with a strong ethos of 'Interesting, Local and Ethical'.
    Caron Pook, the owner of the markets, makes sure that every stall
    that is accepted fits into this standard. High quality locally made
    stalls run by the crafts-person are the majority of the stalls she
    accepts, then there are UK made items that aren't easily found
    on the High Street, a fair bit of vintage, and lastly ethical
    stalls - these include fair trade items etc, and anything that is
    beautiful and made in an ethical manner, ie supporting
    underprivileged people from all walks of life all around the world.
