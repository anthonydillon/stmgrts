THE LAST POST
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    The bugler sent a call of high romance--
    "Lights out! Lights out!" to the deserted square.
    On the thin brazen notes he threw a prayer,
    "God, if it's this for me next time in France ...
    O spare the phantom bugle as I lie
    Dead in the gas and smoke and roar of guns,
    Dead in a row with the other broken ones
    Lying so stiff and still under the sky,
    Jolly young Fusiliers too good to die."
    
    -- Robert Graves
    
    If ever a sound captured the sombre, reflective mood of Remembrance
    Day it is the high melancholic notes of the 'Last Post' - the 
    military bugle call played to mark the end of the day. For 90 years
    nervous buglers across the world have stood up at Armistice, alone
    and unsupported, to evoke through their playing remembrance of all 
    those who have died in war. From local war memorials to the fields
    of Flanders and to cemeteries and cenotaphs far and wide this has 
    been the bugler's privilege and test - and this year the awesome
    responsibility of a 10 year old Cub Scout from St Margarets.

CHRISTMAS SUNDAY MARKETS IN RICHMOND
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Duck Pond Market is going to trial two Sundays in Heron Square,
    where the Saturday market is held, in Richmond. The two dates are 
    Sunday the 28th of November and Sunday the 19th of December 
    from 10.00am to 3.00pm.
    
    If these two dates go well, they will propose a regular weekly 
    Sunday Duck Pond Market.
    
    "The market will include local artists and crafters, live local 
     musicians and other interesting stalls. There will be face 
     painting, hot food, make & takes and a real Christmassy vibe,
     in the elegant setting of the Heron Square, set in the centre
     of busy Richmond, and accessible from Richmond Road, Hill Street
     and the riverside."

ENTIRE ROMAN VILLAGE IS UNEARTHED IN SYON PARK
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    "Remains of a Roman village have been discovered only half a metre
    below the ground in west London.
    
    The site has remained undisturbed partly because it lies in the
    Grade I listed Syon Park and has been protected against ploughing 
    in recent centuries. But it might never have come to light without
    plans to build a new Waldorf Astoria Hotel."
