Don't Miss 'A Very Magical Flute'
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Don't miss this weekend's performances of the 2x2 Opera's 
    'A Very Magical Flute' at All Soul's Church.
    
        "This is a new and exciting adaptation of Mozart's 
         'Magic Flute' by Keith to celebrate the 250th 
         anniversary of Mozart's birth --  a young boy, 
         refusing to practice his flute, is transported back 
         to 1791 and finds himself in the middle of a chaotic 
         dress rehearsal for the first performance. He meets 
         the opera's librettist, Emanuel Schickaneder, who 
         gives him a singing role and explains the story 
         interwoven with extracts from the opera. The boy 
         experiences the frenetic activity that precedes 
         the opening night -- alongside petty jealousy's 
         and gossip, the scenery isn't ready, neither are
         the costumes, the company has run out of money and 
         Mozart hasn't actually finished the opera yet!"

    The performances are on Friday 24th March at 7.30pm and Saturday
    25th March at 2.30pm and 7.30pm, all at All Soul's Church, 
    Northcote Road, St. Margarets. Tickets are L8 / L4.50 available
    on the door or in advance by calling 020 8891 4641.

Richmond District Line Closure
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Richmond branch of the District Line will be closed for the 
    nine days from the 1st to the 10th of April from Richmond to 
    Turnham Green.  Underground tickets will be accepted on South West
    Trains to Waterloo and there will be two replacement bus services.
    Additional works are planned for the Sunday mornings of 16, 23, 
    30 April and 28 May 2006.
    
    Network Rail, the company that owns and maintains the District 
    line track from Richmond to Turnham Green will be completing "much
    needed engineering improvements that will deliver increased 
    reliability of services."  The works include the replacement of 
    the 40 year old track, points, signals and a crossing at 
    Gunnersbury Junction.   The closure was planned over the Easter
    school holiday when demand should be lower.

Fine Food Market Gets Planning Approval

    On 16th March 2006, the Richmond Planning Committee gave its 
    approval for the Fine Food Market to be held in the parking lot 
    of the St Margarets Travern. The market will be on Sundays from

Moormead Area Parking Issues
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Following up from the Councillors CPZ Questionnaire piece we wrote
    back in February we have two things to share.  The first is that 
    Councellor Annie Hambidge is calling a meeting for any interested 
    Moormead Area residents to come to the Turk's Head and discuss 
    ideas with her and the Council's Transport Officers.  The second 
    are some data and comments from the questionnaires given to the 
    Councillors and shared anonymously with us.
