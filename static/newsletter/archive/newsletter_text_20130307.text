ï»¿THE DAY THE CHURCH FELL DOWN
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    The old church had been sitting on a rise of high land by the river
    for over 400 years and it was in poor structural repair. The
    medieval ragstone was pulling apart and some of the interior
    pillars were on the point of collapse. (The original supporting
    walls had been removed in 1640 and replaced by pillars to improve
    the lighting and make more room. That was not a good idea.)

    Most of the parishioners knew that the church was going to fall
    down before long and so did the new vicar, Dr. Samuel Pratt. He
    refused to preach inside the building. According to Lady Wentworth,
    "Dr Pratt had insisted that a tabernacle be erected in the
    churchyard, prior to the collapse. Soe he preached there and
    exhorted al to giv thanks for their great deliverance for the
    church not falling when they were in it, it being then standing.
    The people all laughed at him, and in a week's time it fell to the
    ground, soe all the parish contributes to the building of it."1

    And so, as feared - on the night of 9th April 1713 the parish
    church of St Mary the Virgin in Twickenham, fell down.

FRIENDS OF MOORMEAD OFFICIALLY FORMED
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Friends of Moormead was formally inaugurated at a well attended
    meeting at the Turks Head on Tuesday 5th March 2013. The
    appointment to the Committee of those who had offered to serve was
    confirmed by the members. Stephen Alexander and Mandie Adams
    McGuire were elected Chairman and vice Chairman. The other officers
    required will be appointed later. The Constitution, as required
    by LBRuT was adopted.

    The meeting discussed a number of points, the Pavilion and the new
    tennis courts management, amongst others. In order to establish
    what the Friends of Moormead and other residents see as priorities
    for our park it was decided to deliver a questionnaire to all
    households in the area. The answers will help the Friends in their
    dialogue with LBRuT.

JOHN ARMSTRONG - OBITUARY
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    John Armstrong died recently, and his memorial service was held
    at St Mary's Church, Church Street, Twickenham, on Monday 4 March.
    John chaired the inward investment group of the Twickenham Town
    Centre Management Board and was active in getting new specialised
    businesses into the town, including Laverstoke Park butchers and
    the new Ruben's bakery. He was also a boatbuilder and designer -
    his company, Thanetcraft, designed and built the Hammerton's
    ferryboat, Peace of Mind. For many years he was on the committee
    of the York House Society, and his energy and commitment are
    much missed.

PRESS RELEASE - RICHMOND INCLUSIVE SCHOOLS CAMPAIGN - 5 MARCH 2013
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Good News On Secondary School Admissions - But For How Long?

    Commenting on the new about secondary school offers recently made
    by Richmond Council, Richmond Inclusive Schools Campaign
    (RISC) said:

    It's good news that more children were offered places at one
    of their preferred schools in this year's secondary school offer
    round than in previous years. But hidden behind this 'good news
    story' are concerns about future years that remain unchanged.

    It was clear there would be enough places in 2013, when there will
    be a dip in the numbers leaving borough primary schools. But RISC
    remains concerned about the year-on-year increases in 2014, 2015
    and 2016. By 2016, nearly 400 more children will be leaving borough
    primaries than in 2013.
