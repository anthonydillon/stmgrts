LATEST NEWS
===========================================================



IMPACT OF STRIKES ON RICHMOND COUNCIL SERVICES, 16 AND 17 JULY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    There have been no major disruptions in the borough following the
    start of the 48-hour industrial action, with just one library 
    closed. Other front line services are operating as normal with all
    schools open and waste and recycling collections running as usual. 
    There has been a reduced service for some day care centre users 
    following action by employees from Transport Services and a number
    of support staff. However, no day centres have closed and our 
    most vulnerable service users continue to receive support.
    
    We hope that any disruption to residents will continue to be 
    minimal and that the dispute will be settled quickly.

TAKE THE ST MARGARETS FAIR 2008 SURVEY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    We're always looking for ways to improve the Fair and so we took 
    on board many of the comments you made in the survey we ran after
    last year's Fair.  We're repeating the exercise again this year, 
    and so before your memory of this year's Fair is dimmed, we'd 
    really appreciate you taking a few minutes to answer the ten 
    questions that can be found by following this link. And don't 
    forget you can now contact us all the year round and keep up 
    to date with Fair news at www.stmargaretsfair.org
    
    Thanks for your continuing help and support for the largest 
    annual St Margarets community event.

ECO-ST SHOP OPENED AT SYON PARK
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Eco-St is now open,stocking a wide selection of 'green
    alternatives to everyday products'. We are a concession in the 
    Wyevale Garden Centre, Syon Park. The product range includes 
    alternative energy such as solar panels and rainwater harvesting, 
    over 100 types of low energy lightbulb, eco paint, books on green 
    issues, gifts made from recycled materials, recycled stationary,
    energy meters, wind-up radio and torches, solar mobile chargers, 
    non toxic kitchen and laundry products, mother and baby products
    and a range of natural bodycare.
    
    ECO-St's aim is to help people work out how they can lower their 
    carbon footprint and live a more sustainable life. There are many
    eco initiatives which even save moeny as well as energy, such as 
    solar power, rechargeable batteries and refills of cleaning 
    products. We have a refill station for Ecover laundry and cleaning
    products which enables people to use the same bottle that they 
    originally purchased and refill at a lower cost. We also have 
    recycle bins for batteries, light bulbs and CDs, located 
    in the shop.
    
    Another green initiative we have set up, which is proving popular 
    around our other two stores, is a low energy light bulb library. 
    This is a 'suitcase' type bag housing our most popular 40 low energy
    light bulbs. This can be borrowed by green groups and schools 
    to take home so people can work out in the comfort of their own 
    home, which light bulbs work best in their light fittings. 
    Additionally, we will give 10% of the total spent on low energy 
    light bulbs, through the use ofour library, to the school borrowing 
    the library.
