16 JUNE 2012 - TROOPING THE COLOUR
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    One of the regular features of Trooping the Colour which takes
    place next Saturday on Horse Guards Parade is the playing of the
    "The British Grenadiers" - the signature marching song of the
    Grenadier Guards...

     Some talk of Alexander,
     And some of Hercules
     Of Hector and Lysander,
     And such great names as these.
     But of all the world's great heroes,
     There's none that can compare
     With a tow, row, row, row, row, row,
     To the British Grenadier.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
    A Royal guest will officially open Twickenham Riverside as part of
    a weekend of special events to mark the eagerly anticipated

     were returned, and these all received sales packs."

    "A number of offers were received and on Friday, 1 June 2012,
     contracts were exchanged with a third party to acquire the Studios
     as a going concern, retaining all of the staff. A 10% deposit has
     been paid to the joint administrators' solicitors and it is
     envisaged that completion will take place later this year. At this
     stage, the purchaser wishes to remain anonymous and further details
     will be released after completion."

RIVER CRANE POLLUTION - MOVING BACK FROM THE BRINK
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    On the 30th October 2011 an estimated 10,000 fish were killed in
    the River Crane following a major pollution incident due to a
    failed Thames Water sewage sluice gate.

    Thames Water and the Environment Agency worked around the clock
    to minimize further environmental damage but a seven-mile stretch
    of the river was heavily impacted.

    Fish including mature pike, eel, perch, chub, carp and barbel were
    wiped out along with the vibrant and colorful insects and water
    life following the flow of raw sewage.

    Immediately after the incident Thames Water accepted full
    responsibility and pledged that they would fund the restoration
    of the river over the next five years to improve it beyond its
    pre-pollution state.

    In a significant and welcome move Thames Water has now confirmed a
    fund of 400,000 to support initiatives along this important river
    corridor. The Crane Valley Partnership (CVP) is delighted at the
    opportunity offered by Thames Water. pounds
