ST MARGARETS FAIR CHARITIES FUNDING
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Sorry if you've tried to contact us and we haven't responded since
    our last posting on this website, regarding the money we have 
    reserved for local charities.  We've recently discovered that our 
    email server had failed.  So that still leaves us with some money 
    for our local charities.  As previously mentioned, this year we're
    going to give everybody in St Margarets the opportunity to put 
    forward their suggestions for some worthy local causes that could 
    benefit from a share of this money.  So if you are a local charity 
    or just want to suggest an organisation for us to consider please 
    contact us via our email address info@stmargaretsfair.org   
    
    Your email will get to us this time!

A LONDON CHILDHOOD: 13TH JULY 1955
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    At about 9.30pm on the evening of Easter Sunday, 10th April 1955 a
    28 year old model and nightclub 'hostess' called Ruth Ellis shot 
    and killed her boyfriend David Blakely outside the Magdala pub 
    in South Hampstead. Her first shot missed, injuring a passer-by. 
    The second knocked Blakely to the ground. Ruth calmly walked over
    to where he was laying and fired the remaining four shots at close 
    range. Still holding the gun in her hand she was immediately
    arrested by an off duty policeman who heard her say, "I am guilty,
    I'm a little confused".
    
    Although undeniably guilty of the murder Ruth had been the victim
    of a considerable amount of violent abuse from Blakely. Only 10 
    days before the shooting Ruth had suffered a miscarriage after 
    Blakely had punched her in the stomach. Although she showed a 
    willingness to accept responsibility for her crime Ruth made no 
    real attempt to defend herself in court.  When asked by the
    Prosecutor...
    
      "Mrs Ellis, when you fired that revolver at close range 
      into the body of David Blakely, what did you intend to do?"
      
      It is obvious that when I shot him I intended to kill him," 
      she replied.
