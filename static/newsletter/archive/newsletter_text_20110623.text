﻿A SMARTER ST STEPHEN'S - 23 JUNE 2011
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Plans are underway to transform our school. We'd like to share
    these plans and listen to your feedback.

    All past, present and future parents are invited to join us for a
    glass of wine at 8.30pm Thursday 23rd June in the St Stephen's
    School Hall.

 ﻿THE HALL WITH MANY NAMES
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Anyone who sets out to write a history of the old Hall that stands
    next to St. Stephen's School on the Chertsey Road has their work
    cut out simply because the firm facts are difficult to find. For
    example...what is the place called? Is it "St. Stephen's School
    Hall" as most people think or is it "St Stephen's Church Hall"
    as the notice board outside suggests? Could it be "St Stephen's
    Mission Hall" as one set of records describe it or is it "St Paul's
    Mission Hall" as given in another? Perhaps it is even "St Paul's
    Church"? Confusing...

    To add to the muddle, the old Hall/Church/Mission/St Stephen's/St
    Pauls etc. etc., was not the first Mission Hall in the vicinity. In
    or around 1881 Twickenham Baptist Church built a mission hall on
    the corner of St. Margaret's Road and Turks Lane, or Winchester
    Road as it is now and in 1905 a more permanent church next door
    to it. Fortunately for this researcher both of these buildings were
    demolished when the A316 was constructed in 1933, leaving our old
    Hall/Church/Mission/St Stephen's/St Pauls etc. etc., as the only
    kid on the block. That's a relief.

ST STEPHENS' FIVE-A-SIDE TOURNAMENT
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Saturday, the 18th June 2011, was St Stephen Junior School's annual
    five-a-side tournament. Each year group had their own
    mini-round-robin and champion. There were also trophies for 'best
    dressed' and boy and girl of the match. The weather mostly
    co-operated with only the Year 5 group getting hit with a gale. The
    day was a huge success.

    Well done to all who participated!

    If you have photos you are willing to share, you might notice a lop
    sided number of them for a certain Year 5 team, please email them
    to content@stmgrts.org.uk

EVENT REMINDER: ST MARGARETS FAIR - 16 JULY 2011
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Come celebrate the 33rd annual St Margarets Fair on Moormead Park
    from noon to 8pm on 16th July 2011.

    Every year volunteers organise the following:

     - a full programme of entertainment throughout the day,
       starting with a popular children's '5-a-side' football 
       tournament in the morning on Moormead.
     - During the afternoon there is a dog show on little Moormead
       across Hillview Road.
     - The musical entertainment runs all afternoon on the stage, and we
       moved the stage further away from the tea tent to help separate the
       'rock' from the rolls.
     - There are announcements, interviews and music throughout the day
       from Radio West Middlesex.

    The fair organisers run the Tea Tent, Beer Tent, Pimms Stall, the
    BBQ, the Bric-a-brac stall, the Silent Auction, and the Coconut
    Shy. 

    All profits from these stalls go direct to our charities - please
    support these stalls. See how we spend the money.

TEACHER'S STRIKE SET FOR 30 JUNE 2011
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    "Two of Britain's biggest teaching unions have voted in favour of a
    strike over changes to pensions, in the first sign of collective
    opposition to the coalition's austerity programme.

    The ballot in favour of a strike by the National Union of Teachers
    (NUT) and the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL) is
    expected to close schools across England and Wales this term,
    affecting millions of children. The civil service union the PCS
    publishes the result of its own strike ballot on Wednesday."

    -- from The Guardian - 14 June 2011

    Currently St Stephens CE Junior School has announced they are
    closing on the 30 June.
