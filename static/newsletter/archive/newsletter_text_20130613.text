ï»¿HARRIS + HOOLE = A HOODWINK?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Given the choice I'd rather have a shop where I could buy a gallon
    of paraffin, a box of chisels and a bucket of whitewash but it is
    not to be. Despite being told otherwise St Margarets is about to
    get itself another coffee house. How many does that make it so
    far? 10?

    The old Superdrug store, once tastefully wrapped up in brown paper,
    is about to become a trendy watering hole called 'Harris and Hoole'
    serving what the owners describe as... "fantastic tasting,
    professionally crafted, speciality grade, directly sourced coffee"
    to 'happy people'! Unfortunately some of the people in St Margarets
    are not happy at all.

THE 2013 SUMMER CROWN ROAD COMMUNITY FAIR REPORT
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Last Sunday, up went the bunting and balloons in St Margarets
    for the Crown Road Community Fair. The theme of this years fair was
    My St Margarets Farm - There were pony rides along Bridle Lane,
    real farmyard animals, such as goats, lambs, rabbits and ducklings,
    for all the neighbourhood children (and adults) to enjoy in
    close proximity.

    The Mayor visited to see over 30 stalls that included beloved local
    institutions like the Turks Head's Pimms bar, delicious pastries
    from La Boulangerie and freshly made pancakes from La Creperie
    Bretonne. There were fortune-tellers, jewellery and fashions
    stands, cake stalls, a bouncy castle and the odd song or two
    from local choir Vital Voices. The St Margarets Tavern's car park
    was turned into a fairground, and local business Gymboree sponsored
    the Punch and Judy shows!
