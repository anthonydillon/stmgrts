﻿IN MEMORIUM
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    ‘Go tell the Spartans, thou that passeth by,
    That faithful to their precepts, here we lie’

      Simonides of Ceos (556-468 BC)

    Last weekend we marked Armistice Day and that moment at the end
    of the 1st World War when the guns finally stopped. The 11th hour
    of the 11th day of the 11th month, 1918. Sergeant-Major Richard
    Tobin of ‘Hood Battalion, Royal Naval Division’ recalled the day…

    “The Armistice came, the day we dreamed off. The guns stopped, the
     fighting stopped. Four years of noise and bangs ended in silence.
     The killings had stopped.

     We were stunned. I had been out there since 1914. I should have
     been happy. I was sad. I thought of the slaughter, the hardships,
     the waste and the friends I had lost.”

TWICKENHAM FILM STUDIOS, RICHMOND COUNCIL AND RECYCLING
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Twickenham Film Studios have asked the council to consider removing
    the recycling bins from the council property adjacent to The
    Barons. The studios have decided that the bins are not suitable
    for outside their main reception area and request that they be
    moved as soon as possible. But where to? Do you have any
    suggestions as to where else in St Margarets that would make a good
    place for the recycling bins?

CALLING ALL ASPIRING ROWERS AND COXES
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Twickenham Rowing Club welcomes new and aspiring rowers and coxes!

    What better way to get fit than to join Twickenham Rowing Club
    where for less than it costs to join a gym you get coaching, a
    regularly updated training programme, peers with which to train and
    enjoy social evenings, and the opportunity to embrace your
    competitive spirit in all-round-the-year races.

    We also seek coxswains for our boats - Coxes have the very
    important role of steering crews towards a Win, and to give
    instructions and commands about what needs to be done, motivate
    your rowers and finally coach from within the boat.

    Twickenham Rowing Club is a welcoming open club and accepts people
    of all ages and abilities. We offer a number of different squads
    for experienced rowers and run regular courses for beginners of
    all ages.

    Founded in 1860, Twickenham Rowing Club is one of the oldest and
    largest rowing clubs in London. Our unique position on London’s
    most beautiful stretch of the Thames makes Twickenham an idyllic
    place to row. As a pillar of the local community, Twickenham has a
    strong reputation as a friendly, sociable and welcoming club and
    caters for beginners and experienced rowers of all ages. The club
    is currently benefiting from sustained growth in membership. Our
    ever stronger senior squads cater for professionals with demanding
    careers who also want to race at Henley.

    If you are interested in hearing more about what the club has
    to offer, meeting some of us or having a look around the clubhouse,
    please email Jacqui Johnston: manager@twickenhamrc.net

BEWARE OF BOGUS FORCE REPRESENTATIVE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Heathfield Safer Neighbourhood Team have informed us that a man has
    been calling door to door in the Crane Park area, claiming to be
    working on behalf of the Friends of the river Crane Environment
    (FORCE) and requesting bank details in order to set up direct
    debits to support a recovery fund for the River Crane.

    We have no knowledge of this man or the scheme and it is not a
    method that we would ever adopt or support. If you are approached
    please do not provide any personal information and inform the
    police by calling 101.

    We are working with the Environment Agency, Thames Water and others
    to develop a response to the pollution incident on the River Crane
    and expect this to be fully funded by Thames Water.

    FORCE does run a membership scheme, details of this are available
    on our website

RIVER CRANE POLLUTION UPDATE - 10 NOVEMBER 2011
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Rob Gray gave the FORCE AGM on 10th November 2011 the inside story:
    the cause was a jammed ‘penstock’ (a sluice or floodgate
    for regulating the flow from a pent body of water, as in a
    watermill) at the point where two 2m sewage pipes join to become a
    single 3m pipe. It jammed after had been closed to allow Thames
    Water (TW) to inspect the 3m tunnel using a remote controlled
    camera on a ‘surf board’.

    The TW engineers worked through the night to try to free it; it is
    lifted by a screw gear; when this sheared off they asked the Army
    if they could use explosives to free it. In the end they attached
    jacks to it somehow and jacked it up.

    Before this the sewage had backed up into a hotel basement and was
    forecast to flood a much larger area when Heathrow woke and went
    to the loo en masse. So TW decided that they had no choice but
    to open an emergency gate and discharge it into the river; it would
    in any event have overflowed into the river before long.

    TW have removed, they say, c. 10,000 dead fish which they have
    taken to Mogden so that the range of species (more than 20) and
    ages can be recorded.

    The last time a London river was fouled like this was a discharge
    of bleach into the Wandle by TW a few years ago: they paid 0.5 mil
    pounds into a trust fund to pay for the cost of bringing the river back
    to life. So it is expected that something similar will be agreed
    this time, before TW come to court in a year’s time or later.
