ï»¿A TALE OF TWO STORIES
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Just over 60 years ago, in June 1953, the 'Daily Express' newspaper
    produced a compilation of six daily editions, as a souvenir of what
    they described as 'The Story of the Century' - the Coronation
    of Queen Elizabeth 2nd... But between the cheery reports of pomp
    and parties, celebration and crowds, there appeared a darker, more
    tragic story...

A FRESH LOOK AT LOCAL WINTER DAYS OUT
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Some great ideas from For Sanity's Sake

    It is more difficult to motivate ourselves to go out in winter -
    the days are short, it's cold and the weather can be generally
    uninviting. But getting out is important for both our wellbeing and
    that of our children and lifts our mood, helps us fight colds and
    infections, invigorates us and keeps us fit.

EVENT REMINDER: ST MARGARETS QUESTION TIME - 10 FEBRUARY 2015
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    To mark the launch of the second phase of Village Planning, local
    'question-time' style events will be occurring in Richmond, East
    Twickenham and St Margarets over the next few months. These events
    will enable residents to share local issues with the Leader of the
    Council and Cabinet Members. During the Village Planning
    'question-time' event residents will be able to make suggestions
    for improvements and hold leading members of the Council to
    account.

HOME-START RICHMOND - NEW VOLUNTEER COURSE - STARTING 16 APRIL 2015
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Are you a parent/grandparent? Would you like to help local
    families? If you can spare a few hours a week to help families
    with children under 5, local charity Home-Start Richmond can train
    you to support those having a difficult time. We welcome people
    from all backgrounds and although languages are not necessarily
    needed for this role, we would love to hear from anyone who is
    fluent in English and another language such as Urdu, Farsi, Polish
    or Russian.

RECLAIM ROSSLYN ROAD PETITION
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    The petition against the ongoing anti-abortion protest outside the
    BPAS clinic in East Twickenham gained nearly 400 local signatures
    and was submitted to Richmond Council last November. It was well
    received, across all parties, and the Council committed to do all
    it could within its powers to limit the impact of the protests
    on the lives of local residents. The resident group that runs
    Reclaim Rosslyn Road has also taken the case to local MP, Vince
    Cable. He has since written to the Home Secretary because local
    council and police powers are limited and cannot prevent the
    current disruption.
