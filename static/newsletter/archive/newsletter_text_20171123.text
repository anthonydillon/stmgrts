    Most people reading this won't know who Sir Jack Petchey is
    but there is a good chance that their children will. Most these
    people wouldn't know that Jack Petchey was born in Plaistow in 1925
    and learned his considerable business skills selling fruit and veg
    off a barrow in a street market in east London... and they wouldn't
    know that over the years he has given away nearly &pound;100
    million pounds to thousands of young Londoners to inspire and raise
    their aspirations and celebrate their achievements.
