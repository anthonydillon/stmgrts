﻿ISLEWORTH BREWERY
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    "From the towns all inns have been driven; from the villages
     most... Change your hearts, or you will lose your inns, and you
     will deserve to have lost them. But when you have lost your inns,
     drown your empty selves - for you will have lost the last
     of England."

    - Hilaire Belloc, the preface to 'The Four Men' 1912

    The street names are probably a giveaway - Shirehorse Way,
    Clydesdale Close, Malting Way, Draysman Way... but just off St
    John's Road that links Old Isleworth and Hounslow there once stood
    a brewery that supplied beer to pubs from Hammersmith to Teddington
    and beyond.

EVENT REMINDER: REDLEES UNROOTED - 4 TO 5 APRIL 2015
----------------------------------------------------------------------


    Opening Saturday 4 April, 6.30 - 9.00pm and Sunday 5 April,
    11am - 4pm

    UNROOTED brings together the work of four visual artists who
    explore, in different ways, the various intersections of physical
    nature, technology and simulation. Using images that conjure
    up undefined representations of both past and future, the artists
    ask us to question our relationship with our landscape, whether
    virtual, imagined or real.

RICHMOND COUNCIL GETS 10 MILLION TO IMPROVE CYCLING
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Cycling facilities along the A316 will be improved, thanks
    to funding from the Mayor of London, Richmond Council has
    confirmed.

    Last year it was announced that Richmond upon Thames missed out
    on the top prize for Transport for London's Mini Holland scheme.
    However, the Mayor of London's cycling adviser - Andrew Gilligan -
    was so impressed with the Richmond bid that he agreed to look
    at investing millions of pounds into the borough's
    cycling infrastructure.

    10m will now be invested into improving the cycling facilities
    along the A316, thanks to TfL. They have also confirmed an
    additional £2m to assist with the provision of cycling links
    from Twickenham to A316. pounds
