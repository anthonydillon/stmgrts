LATEST NEWS
===========================================================



ï»¿THE BOOK: THE MOST FAMOUS ICE RINK IN THE WORLD
----------------------------------------------------------------------
   
    The work on the book, The Most Famous Ice Rink in the World,
    started in earnest towards the end of August 2015 although it had
    begun as the seed of an idea a number of years before.

    Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean were contacted and agreed
    to write the introduction. This was really appreciated as they
    trained in Richmond Rink in the 70s and the 80s, sometimes
    with Betty Callaway.

    Professor Jeremy Hamilton-Miller has been researching the history
    of ice skating and skating in the borough for some time and he
    followed on with an article of the years leading up to the opening
    of the rink in East Twickenham.
