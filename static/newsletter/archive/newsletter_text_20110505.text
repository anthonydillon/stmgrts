LATEST NEWS
===========================================================



POISON GAS WEEK
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Early in May 1942, the third year of the war, people of Richmond
    were rather surprised when this leaflet from the mayor, E. A
    Collings, dropped through their letter box.


     POISON GAS WEEK

     Dear Sir or Madam,

     During the period June 15th - June 20th it will be necessary
     upon one or two occasions to liberate in the streets of the Borough
     a form of War-gas....

     ...it will cause extremely unpleasant symptoms if breathed without
     the protection of a respirator; and, since no warning will be given
     of the "surprise attack", you will therefore required to have your
     gas-mask constantly with you.


    This was the announcement of a week designed to raise public
    awareness of the dangers of an enemy attack with poison gas.
    Similar notices appeared on the front pages of the local newspapers
    with the warning...
    
    DANGER - THERE WILL BE SURPRISE POISON GAS ATTACKS SO 
             CARRY YOUR GAS-MASK - ALWAYS

RACC BUSINESS, ENTERPRISE AND NETWORKING EVENTS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Following the first RACC Business Networking event held in February
    2011 which featured presenters from the Chambers of Commerce and
    the local Council, we received numerous requests to provide similar
    opportunities which combine essential information needed by modern
    businesses with important networking opportunities.

    Our second Business Networking event "From Bellman to Kindle" will
    focus on the essential information the modern communicator and
    networker needs to work effectively in business today. The host and
    facilitator for the night, William Freeman, will deliver this
    lively, interactive session which draws upon communications lessons
    learnt not only from the traditional town crier and bellman but
    also from the modern day magician and mentalist.

ALL IN ONE PLANNING EVENT - 11 JUNE 2011
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Last year, over 13,500 local people took the opportunity to have
    their say about their local areas through the survey run by
    Richmond Council. That represents 17% of households spread evenly
    across the borough.

    First results from the survey, show that 92 per cent of local
    people have said they were happy with their local area -- however
    they did highlight a number of areas that need improving.

    We have now fully analysed all the results and are beginning
    to understand what people want for their local area and villages. 
    
    To help with the next stage, the Council has organised a series
    of local area planning events across the borough over the next few
    months where people will be able to get together to decide what
    they want for their local area.

    If you would like to have your say about the area where you live,
    please come along to your nearest event, which is on the 11th June
    for Twickenham, St Margarets, East Twickenham and Strawberry Hill
    Villages in the Twickenham Civic Centre foyer from 10am to 4pm.

    For more information and to see the schedule of events, go

TWICKENHAM ROWING CLUB
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Time to get back on the river... Calling all rowers!

    Spring is here, the days are getting longer, what better way
    to spend your spare time than on the water? Maybe you've just
    finished Uni or recently moved to the area and are looking
    to continue rowing at a local club? Or maybe you used to row and
    have had a break for a while but would love to get back into it.

    Twickenham Rowing Club is looking for experienced male and female
    rowers to join our Senior squads. We are a friendly,
    well-established club with excellent weights and rowing coaches and
    a structured training plan in place. We are competitive at local
    regattas and have entered crews for Henley for over 130 years. This
    year we are hoping to build on the success of previous years.

    We are also looking for coxes. If you have coxing experience or are
    looking to learn how to cox with a view to racing with us this
    summer, we would love to hear from you.

    If you are interested in hearing more about what the club has
    to offer, meeting some of us or having a look around the clubhouse,
    please email twixmembership@gmail.com.

EVENT REMINDER: TEDDINGTON THEATRE CLUB'S STEEL MAGNOLIAS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    In the world of Truvy's local-homegrown beauty salon, six very
    different women come together to gossip, counsel, criticise and
    comfort one another. Helped by her eager new assistant Annelle, the
    outspoken, wise-cracking Truvy dispenses shampoos and free advice
    to Ouiser, the town's rich curmudgeon, Miss Clairee, an eccentric
    millionaire, M'Lynn, the local social leader, and M'Lynn's daughter
    Shelby, who's about to marry a "good ole boy". From weddings
    to divorces, babies to funerals, new beginnings to happy endings,
    they share each moment in their lives with grace, determination,
    and perfectly coiffed hair. When tragedy strikes, it is in the
    familiar comfort of Truvy's salon where they seek the solace and
    support that carries them through.

TAKE THE POLICE'S PUBLIC ACCESS SURVEY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) has launched a review into
    the different ways in which the public can contact police and
    access our services. These range from telephone, online and
    face-to-face methods, including via police stations
    and appointments.

    In these challenging financial times, it is essential that the MPS
    makes best use of available resources. This is one of the key aims
    of the review that will ensure we can deliver an efficient and cost
    effective service in the right place at the right time.

    As part of the review, we have launched an anonymous online survey.
    We will use the results of the survey, which runs until 27th May
    2011, to develop a strategy to maintain and enhance public access
    to policing services within a core minimum standard. No decisions
    have yet been made and any changes will only take place with the
    approval of the most senior officers and staff who form the MPS
    Management Board and the Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA), an
    independent governing body that holds the MPS to account.

    To have your say and influence the future of local policing in your
    area please take ten minutes to complete this survey; your views
    are important to us and will help us improve our services to better
    meet your needs.

OBITUARY: MAC MCGANN - LOCAL MUSICIAN AND ARTIST
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Michael "Mac" McGann was a folk singer and songwriter, a unique
    guitarist, barrelhouse blues pianist, harmonica player, graphic
    artist, wood carver and cartoonist. He was best-known for his live
    performances in pubs and clubs around London alongside guitarists
    and singers who would become more famous - including John Martyn,
    John Renbourn, Ralph McTell and the "King of the Buskers" Don
    Partridge. McGann co-founded several folk bands, including the
    Levee Breakers in the 1960s with the 12-string guitarist Johnny
    Joyce and singer Beverley Kutner (later to become Beverley Martyn).
    They were a breakthrough outfit who became a major influence
    on McTell and such folk groups as Pentangle, with Renbourn and Bert
    Jantsch, and later the Incredible String Band.

    McTell, who would make his name with Streets of London, was
    inspired by McGann, whom he described as "truly in the vanguard
    of the singer/songwriter movement, long before the term was
    coined." McGann played his unique, self-designed double-neck guitar
    on McTell's early solo albums and on many tracks laid down by the
    popular '70s rock band McGuinness Flint.

ST MARGARETS' ROYAL WEDDING STREET PARTIES
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    St Margarets had at least five street parties to celebrate the
    Royal wedding. It was lovely to see neighbours coming together
    to share and meal and toast the newly weds. We saw lots of games
    for children and adults, bands and long tables full of food.

    Here is a slide-show on flickr of some of the parties in
    St Margarets.
