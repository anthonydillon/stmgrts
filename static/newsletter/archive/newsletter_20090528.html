<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2009/05/childrens_writing_competition_launched.html">Children&#39;s Writing Competition Launched</a></h3>

<p>Children in the borough of Richmond are being asked to combine literary flair with the goal of buying text books to support the learning of slum children in Delhi, India.</p>

<p>A teacher at St John the Baptist C of E School, Hampton Wick, visited slums in Delhi last year and witnessed the poor provision of education and educational resources. In response, the school have decided to run a writing competition, not only to create  funding to buy modern text books for those children who attend school, but to raise awareness of the amazing work carried out by <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">ASHA, </span></span></span>an Indian charity which works in some of Delhi&#8217;s worst slums. Visit <a href="http://www.asha-india.org/educationsuccessstories.aspx">www.asha-india.org/educationsuccessstories.aspx</a> to read about the charity&#8217;s work.</p>

<p>The competition is open for children aged between 6-11 years old, who attend any of Richmond&#8217;s state primary schools.</p>

<p>Children are being asked to write a poem or a short piece of prose, no longer than 500 words, on the theme, &#8216;I Have a Dream&#8217;. To tell their story, children in Years 1 and 2 are being invited to draw a story board of six frames with written captions. The fee of &#163;3 per entry will go to <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">ASHA.</span></span></span></p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2009/05/cpz_recommendation_approved.html"><span class="caps">CPZ</span> Recommendation Approved</a></h3>

<p>From the official record:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;On 20<sup>th</sup> May the Council&#8217;s Transport Consultative Group which consists of members of both political parties and lay experts advised the Cabinet Member for Transport and Parking to make a decision to include Moor Mead and Sidney Roads and Cole Park View in a further extension of the St Margarets South <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">CPZ.</span></span></span> However the Group also advised the Cabinet Member to give consideration to the inclusion of Kenley and Godstone Roads in the Traffic Management Order to afford their residents the opportunity to reconsider their position in the light of this further extension. Therefore whilst advertisement of the Traffic Order will include those roads the Council in accordance with its policy and supported by your councillors will only implement controlled parking in them if there is a majority in favour.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The ward councillors will send a street letter to Godstone and Kenley to clarify and dispel doubts.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2009/05/turings_poisoned_apple.html">Turing&#39;s Poisoned Apple</a></h3>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;We can see only a short distance ahead but we can see plenty there that needs to be done.&#8221;</p></blockquote>


<p>The corporate logo of Apple computers is a rainbow-striped apple with a single bite missing from it. For most people it is no more than the bright emblem of a successful modern company. For others with longer memories it is a poignant tribute to a remarkable man who lived for a short period of his life in Hampton.</p>

<p>Alan Turing was the second son of Julius Mathison Turing and his wife Sara. He was born at 2 Warrington Crescent in Maida Vale on 23 June 1912. Because his father worked as a civil servant in India, Alan and his older brother John were brought up by family friends and relatives in England.</p>


<p><img src="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/images//alan_turing_thumb.png" width="119" height="150" alt="ALAN TURING" align="right" style="padding: 2px; border: 1px solid #ccc;" /></p>




<p>He was educated at Sherborne School in Dorset and in October 1931 went up to King&#8217;s College, to read Mathematics. He showed a prodigious talent and in March 1935, at the age of 22, he was elected a Fellow of King&#8217;s. The same year he invented an abstract computing machine - now known as the Turing Machine - which stored information as binary symbols on an infinite paper tape. It was the template for all subsequent stored-programme digital computers and provided the basis for the modern theory of computing.</p>

<p>After a short period at Princeton University in America in 1938 Turing returned to Britain and on the outbreak of war joined the top-secret Government Code and Cipher School at Bletchley Park. Here he played a vital role in deciphering the radio messages encrypted by the German &#8216;Enigma&#8217; code machine. To do this he helped design decrypting machines called &#8216;bombes&#8217;. These provided vital intelligence for the Allies.  By early 1942 Bletchley Park was &#8216;cracking&#8217; about 39,000 intercepted messages each month, rising subsequently to over 84,000 messages a month - approximately two every minute. Turing&#8217;s breaking of the German naval codes helped defeat the U-Boat menace in the North Atlantic. His work on the binary &#8216;Fish&#8217; ciphers allowed the Allies access to high-level signals from Hitler and the German High Command. A colleague said that Turing&#8217;s time at Bletchley was&#8230;</p>
