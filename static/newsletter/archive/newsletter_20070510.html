<p><em>10 May 2007</em></p>

<p>Welcome to the St Margarets Community Website Newsletter (<a href="https://stmargarets.london">stmargarets.london</a>). Each Thursday we will send you the latest news and events from the website.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2007/05/event_reminder_the_way_of_the_world.html">Event Reminder : The Way of the World</a></h3>

<p><em>fops, fools, and ferocious wit</em></p>

<p>There&#8217;s a time-travel opportunity coming up soon, for one week only, at the Mary Wallace Theatre. On May 19th Twickenham&#8217;s delightful club theatre will be transformed into an early 1700s playhouse, for William Congreve&#8217;s <a href="https://stmargarets.london/event/Play/200705100745">The Way of the World</a>.</p>

<p>The spirit of a bawdy age will come alive again, and audiences will be welcomed by periwigged gentlemen and saucy orange sellers.  Three of the five acts &#8212; as the playbill points out &#8212; take place in a bedchamber. It was all so startlingly modern for its time, that the critics of the day turned up their noses at it. More fool they. Amongst other delights it contains one of the most celebrated battle-of-the-sexes scenes ever, and subjects the vices and stupidities of the age to mercilessly comic scrutiny.</p>

<p>Unlike so many modern revivals of restoration comedy, this production will be in authentic period costume. As the next instalment of the Richmond Shakespeare Society&#8217;s 2007 season Theatre Through the Ages, it&#8217;s an evening of fun not to be missed.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2007/05/pottery_caf_celebrates_5_years_in_richmond.html">Pottery Caf&eacute; Celebrates 5 Years in Richmond</a></h3>

<p>Almost 30,000 people have decorated their own pottery at the Pottery Caf&eacute; in Richmond over the last five years and staff there have decorated some 15,000 plates with baby&#8217;s first footprints!</p>

<p>To celebrate five years of its pottery decorating studio in Richmond this month  the Pottery Caf&eacute; is offering customers 20% off pottery to decorate yourself during &#8216;Party Week&#8217; Monday 14<sup>th</sup> - Friday 18<sup>th</sup> May. Since opening in May 2002, thousands of Mums and babies, families, hen party groups and children&#8217;s birthday parties have all enjoyed the creative experience of painting pottery together, much of which is exclusively supplied by Emma Bridgewater.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2007/05/armstrongs_to_take_st_margarets_butcher_shop.html">Armstrongs Takes Over Frisby&#39;s Butcher Shop</a></h3>

<p>According to local, David Bertram:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;I was in Armstrongs butchers this morning and the proprietor confirmed that they have signed to take the former Frisby shop and hope to open from early August. He said they&#8217;d had some run ins with the &#8216;elf-n-safety&#8217; goons who had wanted all the old tiles taken down(!) but that they hoped to be able to retain most of the interior as-is.</p>

<p>Great news and hope that everyone will support them, though the quality of their products speaks for itself and I don&#8217;t think they should have too many problems round here.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Good news if it happens&#8230; now for the bakery&#8230;.</p>

<p><em>Armstrongs of Richmond is an excellent butchers on 205 Lower Mortlake Rd, Richmond, <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">TW9</span></span></span> 2LP</em></p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2007/05/st_marys_astroturf_planning_problems.html">St Mary&#39;s Astroturf Planning Problems</a></h3>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had a battle between St Stephens and the council, now it&#8217;s St Mary&#8217;s turn.  An unfortunately there&#8217;s an awful lot more at stake. For the past few years St Mary&#8217;s has been raising money for an astroturf pitch. It finally reached the target, and &#163;38,000 was spent on the new pitch at the junior site (adjacent to Orleans Park School).</p>

<p>For some reason, local residents adjoining the site kicked up a fuss, and claimed that the pitch should have had planning permission. A heated meeting took place at the council last night and it transpires that it should indeed have had planning permission. Retrospective permission was declined and an enforcement order issued, so the entire pitch will have to be torn up and thrown away.</p></blockquote>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2007/05/godstone_lease_extension_forum.html">Godstone Lease Extension Forum</a></h3>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;A number of us in Godstone Road are forming an action group relating to the lease extension problem.  Those of us living in maisonettes are now in position where the length of the lease on our properties is running short creating a potential obstacle if we were to try and sell.  The landlords are now asking for &#163;28k to extend to a reasonable 99 years.  We believe that a great number of households are faced with the same dilemma.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8212; <em>from Madeleine Menzies</em></p>

<p>To help, we have set up a <a href="https://stmargarets.london/cgi-bin/yabb/YaBB.pl?board=lease">forum</a> where residents can discuss this issue.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2007/05/waste_prevention_action_plan_200708.html">Waste Prevention Action Plan 2007/08</a></h3>

<p>Residents who have strong views about the Council&#8217;s waste collection services &#8212; and who among us does not? &#8212; should seize the chance to let them know what you think of their plans for the future. They are consulting on their &#8216;Waste Prevention Action Plan 2007/08&#8217; until Monday, 21 May. Each year the borough&#8217;s residents throw away enough waste to cover Twickenham Rugby Stadium with a pile of rubbish 50m deep.</p>
