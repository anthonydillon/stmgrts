ï»¿THE DAY THAT CAB CALLOWAY CAME TO RICHMOND
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    The argument about who created rock 'n' roll music and who first
    recorded it has been rattling on since Trixie Smith released "My
    Man Rocks Me (With One Steady Roll)" in 1922. Whether it was the
    Boswell Sisters with "Rock and Roll" in 1934, "Rockin' and Rollin'"
    by Charlie Gracie in 1952 or Bill Haley and "Rock Around the Clock"
    in 1955, there have been many shoulders pushing at the boogie
    woogie wheel - and on December 2nd 1952 one of the greatest early
    rock pioneers came to Richmond. His name was Cab Calloway - and he
    was opening a clothes shop.

    Ralph Taylor had set up "The Centre For the Well-Dressed Man" at 19
    Kew Road, directly opposite Richmond Station. Being a hip kind
    of guy, Mr Taylor decided that he needed a groovy face to launch
    his new venture - and the man he chose was the grooviest of them
    all - U.S band leader, film and recording star and King of the
    Hi-De-Hi, Mr. Cab Calloway.

RICHMOND AID BOOSTS ADVICE SERVICE FOR DISABLED PEOPLE
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Richmond AID boosts advice service to help more local people deal
    with changes affecting disabled people

    Major changes affecting disabled people have seen calls to the
    Richmond AID advice service increase by over 40% in the last 12
    months. Right now they are finding disabled people experiencing
    complex problems with the bedroom tax, housing difficulties,
    financial troubles and issues with disability benefits. This is
    expected to increase with Personal Independence Payments which will
    replace Disability Living Allowance this June. The Disability
    Action and Advice Centre has expanded with more advisors available
    every day to cope with the increased demand.
