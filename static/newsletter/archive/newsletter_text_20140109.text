LATEST NEWS
===========================================================



ï»¿A BRILLIANT MIND PARDONED
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    On the 24th December 2013, while the rest of us were preparing
    for Christmas, a man who once lived in Hampton was pardoned for a
    crime of the heart.

    Under the terms of the Royal Prerogative of Mercy, the WW2
    code-breaker and computer scientist Alan Turing, previously
    convicted for 'homosexual activity,' was granted a posthumous
    pardon by the Queen. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said...

    "Dr Alan Turing was an exceptional man with a brilliant mind. His
     brilliance was put into practise at Bletchley Park during the
     second world war, where he was pivotal to breaking the Enigma code,
     helping to end the war and save thousands of lives."

LOCAL CHARITY 'ME TOO and CO' ARE LOOKING FOR VOLUNTEERS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    We are a charity that helps children and young people
    with additional needs and their families. We offer a broad range
    of activities for children as well as support and advice for their
    parents and carers. We are based in Twickenham at The Crossway
    Centre, near Marble Hill. We need volunteers to support the
    children with fun activities such as music therapy, art, singing
    and signing.

    We are looking for people:

     - Who are warm, friendly, flexible with a 'can do' attitude.
     - Who enjoy playing with children and chatting to parents.
     - Who are happy to help set up and pack away toys for play sessions
     - Who can commit to the sessions.

    You will be joining a small, friendly group of dedicated
    volunteers, where you will benefit from training and will help
    to make a difference to the children as well as to parents
    and carers!

PETITION: STEP FREE ACCESS AT ST MARGARETS STATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Local resident Paul Nicoll has started a petition to Network Rail
    to request step free access at St Margarets Station. The
    petition states:

    Given the number of local people with young children and buggies,
    we believe that the introduction of step free access at St
    Margarets railway station should now be seriously considered
    by Network Rail. You only have to spend a few minutes at the
    station to witness mums struggling down the many steps with their
    buggies. This is not only dangerous but essentially impossible
    without the help of passers-by. This issue is literally impacting
    hundreds of local people (as hopefully this petition
    will demonstrate).

    On reaching 1,000 signatures or more a full council debate will
    be held.

    If you are interested in learning more or signing, please visit the
    Richmond Council website by 20 March 2014.

    course, designed specifically for the beginner who has some
    previous experience, already knows some of the basics and wants

    BEGINNERS' - a set of five week courses, designed for those with no

MISSING DOG: BLACK LABRADOR RETRIEVER
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Black Labrador Retriever, Lily, went missing from Crane Park /
    Kneller Gardens area on Christmas Eve.

    Her owners think she may have been swept downstream. I know there
    are many gardens backing onto the River Crane and if she was, she
    may have been able to scramble out and into a garden, so if you
    have, or know anyone who has a house backing onto the River or an
    allotment close to the River Crane, please could you kindly check?

    The owners are constantly searching and contacting all the rescue
    centres / vets etc... The dog is micro chipped and was wearing a
    red collar with a tag.

    There is a substantial cash reward for Lily's safe return.

    Please contact 07775860964 or 07775860964 if you have
    any information.
