<p><em>10 January 2013</em></p>

<p>Welcome to the St Margarets Community Website Newsletter (<a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk">www.stmgrts.org.uk</a>). Occasional Thursdays we will send you the latest news and events from the website.</p>


<h2>Latest News</h2>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2013/01/the_monastery_of_sion_part_1_in_the_beginning.html">The Monastery of Sion - Part 1 - In the Beginning</a></h3>

<p><img src="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/assets/images/2013/SION1_The-Vision-of-St-Bridget_thumb.jpg" width="150" height="157" alt="The Vision of St Bridget" align="right" style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 1px;"/></p>

<p>Is it a mysterious location hidden in the pages of &#8220;The Da Vinci Code&#8221;?  It isn&#39;t.  Was it founded in Syon Park- It wasn&#39;t.</p>

<p>The Monastery of St. Saviour, the Blessed Virgin Mary and St Bridget of Sion of the order of St. Augustine was built by the Thames on meadows close to where Richmond Lock now stands. It was established on 22<sup>nd</sup> of February 1415 by King Henry 5<sup>th</sup> who laid the first stone himself and dedicated to St Bridget, famous for her visions of Christ.</p>

<p>Henry 5<sup>th</sup>&#39;s royal charter stipulated that his new monastery would be for 60 nuns under an Abbess along with 13 priests, 4 deacons and 8 lay brothers under a General Confessor. To prevent any ecclesiastical hanky-panky the two communities, nuns and monks, were separated by a &#8220;procession door&#8221; that was firmly secured with two locks, each with its own key. One key was kept by the Abbess in a large chest which had 3 locks, each of which had a key of its own. The other key was kept by the General Confessor in a similar chest which again had 3 locks and 3 keys. A locksmith could have made a fortune.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2013/01/diyers_please_help_a_great_local_charity.html"><span class="caps">DIY</span>ers, Please Help a Great Local Charity</a></h3>

<p>Richmond Furniture Scheme - your local re-use charity - has a warehouse in Twickenham where good-quality re-used furniture is displayed and sold at competitive prices.  The Scheme was set up to help people on benefits, but is now open to anyone. We are keen to increase circulation of furniture coming in and out of the warehouse so as to reduce the amount of bulky goods going to landfill.</p>

<p>We provide training opportunities in basic carpentry and maintenance to young people, and offer work-experience to the long-term unemployed.<br/>
To provide a good service</p>

<ul>
<li>We rely on people giving us donations of good-quality furniture.</li>
<li>We also rely on volunteers to help with gardening, basic maintenance, warehouse and office work, carpentry and customer service</li>
</ul>

<p>In particular, we are urgently looking for someone to help us with a <em>one-off project</em>. We want to convert a small lobby in our warehouse into a reception area. This will make us more efficient. If there is anyone who has building and maintenance skills, and is willing to volunteer some time, please contact us.</p>

<p>If you can help in any way phone  0208 274 9517</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2013/01/updated_event_reminder_friends_of_moormead_park_29.html">Updated Event Reminder: Friends of Moormead Park - 29 January 2013</a></h3>

<h4>An Open Meeting will be held at The Winchester Hall, Turk&#39;s Head, Winchester Street on <a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/event/meeting/200705143740">Tuesday 29<sup>th</sup> January 2013 at 7pm</a></h4>

<p>Our Council is making changes to the way in which our green spaces are managed. They have suggested that a &#39;Friends of Moormead&#39; be formed so that they can consult with a representative local body.</p>

<p>The proposed Friends of Moormead will neither be a legislative nor an enforcement body. It will exist solely to further the full enjoyment of Moormead Park by advising &amp; consulting with <span class="caps">LBRUT.</span></p>

<p>We are keen to have a Friends of Moormead properly constituted by 31<sup>st</sup> March 2013 when the new framework of <span class="caps">LBRUT </span>contracts start.</p>

<p>The more people who sign up and join the &#39;Friends of Moormead&#39;, to ensure we safeguard its future use for the local and wider community, the louder our voice will be.</p>

<p><em><span class="caps">PLEASE COME ALONG JOIN</span> UP <span class="caps">AND HAVE</span> A <span class="caps">DRINK</span> IN <span class="caps">THE TURK</span>&#39;S <span class="caps">HEAD</span></em></p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2013/01/do_you_like_singing_join_the_richmond_community_ch.html">Do You Like Singing? Join the Richmond Community Choir</a></h3>

<p><img src="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/assets/images/2013/richmond_comm_choir_thumb.png" width="150" height="113" alt="richmond comm choir" align="right" style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 1px;"/></p>

<p>Set up and sponsored by Richmond upon Thames College as an evening class five years ago, and now a self-managed Charity, Richmond Community Choir now has over 30 friendly and welcoming members of all ages united by their enjoyment of singing.</p>

<p>Led by an inspiring and experienced director/composer/arranger, we build a changing repertoire of shorter pieces, democratically chosen, and covering a wide range of both secular and sacred music from the middle ages up to pop and musical classics.</p>

<p>Membership of the Choir is open to all and is without audition, and although sheet music is provided, sight reading is not necessary. The Choir performs both as part of College events and also increasingly in other venues.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Listen very carefully, I shall say zis only once&#8230;&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Based on the popular TV series, the stage version of &#39;Allo &#39;Allo follows the hapless caf&#233; owner Ren&#233; as he fends off amorous waitresses, his oversexed wife, Edith (stupid woman!) and assists the escape of two dim British airmen. All this during a visit from the F&#252;hrer and while struggling to cash-in on the priceless portrait hidden in a sausage in his cellar.</p>

<p>Zut alors! It&#39;s enough to make a man talk in a funny accent.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2013/01/the_most_famous_ice_rink_in_the_world_the_book.html">The Most Famous Ice Rink in the World - The Book</a></h3>

<p>Richmond&#39;s iconic and much-missed Ice Rink may be long gone, but as we are discovering, it is certainly by no means forgotten. The riverside pleasure dome played such a central part in the lives of so many local people down the years, that even 20 years after it was controversially closed, a warm place is reserved in the hearts of many for the icy relic.</p>

<p>The &#39;Memories of Richmond Ice Rink&#39; Facebook group has been buzzing with tales from differ&Acirc;&shy;ent generations, written by people who grew up on ice, and who remain connected because of &#39;The Most Famous Ice Rink In The World&#39;; and buried in the foundations of the apartments that stand in its place, beats the heart of a proud, old local treasure.</p>

<p>Twickenham Alive and Legends Publishing have teamed up to produce a very special book for 2013, designed to encapsulate the amazing stories that we are unearthing on a weekly basis - real stories supplied by real people. Some will make readers laugh, some will make readers cry, but all will underline the continued community spirit that exists for Richmond Ice Rink.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/recycle-your-christmas-tree-thumb.jpg" width="150" height="139" alt="recycle" align="right"/></p>

<p>Household real Christmas trees will be collected for recycling between Monday 7 and Friday 18 January 2013 on the same day as your normal waste and recycling collections.</p>

<p>Real Christmas trees only - remove all decorations, pots and stands. Present trees whole unless more than 3 metres long. Please cut trees longer than this into smaller pieces.</p>

<p>Put your tree out on your normal collection day in a place that is easy to see but does not block the pavement, ideally next to your recycling containers.</p>

<p>Last year we collected around 20,000 Christmas trees for recycling which was fantastic. However, high demand means <em>we may not collect all trees immediately. If yours is not taken first time, put it out again the following week on your collection day.</em></p>
