LATEST NEWS
===========================================================



ï»¿THE URBAN FOX
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    A.K.A Vulpes Vulpes, European Red Fox, Reynard, Old Timothy, Basil
    Brush, Resident Urban Carnivore
    
    Behaviour: Solitary hunter. Intelligent and cunning. Known
    to produce 28 different calls to communicate with other foxes. Uses
    tail as a flag and signal.
    
    Diet: Rodents, rabbits, birds, fish, frogs, fruit and vegetables.
    Opportunistic feeder - garbage and pet food.
    
    Numbers: Approx 290,000 total UK population. 33, 000 living in
    urban areas. 10,000 living in London. Population largely unchanged
    since 1980's.

    We've all seen them, heard them and probably even smelt them too.
    To some they are an urban delight. To others they are a cursed
    nuisance. They are the Urban Fox and there is probably some living
    in or near your backyard right now.

    Given the right circumstances they will poo and pee all over your
    garden, rip up plants, keep you awake with their eerie screams,
    knock over your dustbins, tear open rubbish sacks in search
    of discarded food and then scatter the contents down the street.
    Foxes can and do chase cats - but most cats can easily see them
    off. Foxes very occasionally attack small children but it is a rare
    event. The far greater risk to children comes from dangerous dogs.

HEADSTART UNI - WHAT YOUR CHILD REALLY NEEDS TO TAKE TO UNIVERSITY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    St Margarets parent Hilary Thomson found the one thing her child
    needed wasn't available from any shop...

    Freshers week looms and, in anticipation, retailers are queuing
    up to sell soon-to-be students everything from calculators
    to colanders, not to mention overdrafts and credit cards. At the
    big Sainsbury's in Hampton last weekend, the aisles were crowded
    with young people and slightly stressed-looking parents piling
    up trolleys with duvets and giant packs of pasta. At Ikea last week
    they ran out of tin openers. Imagine.

    Yet the one thing you realise your child really needs at this stage
    is not available from any shop - and that's an instant grasp of the
    reality of budgeting, banking, credit, sensible shopping and
    general money management.

EVENT REMINDER: SPACE TO BE'S DAY OF MINDFULNESS - 25 OCTOBER 2014
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    This autumn Space to Be will be offering a Day of Mindfulness on 25
    October 2014 and two mindfulness taster sessions on Wednesday,
    November 5th and Monday, December 8th at the Emmanuel Centre, at
    the back of St James Catholic Church in Twickenham.

    Mindfulness is a practice which involves deliberately bringing your
    awareness to the present moment with acceptance and non-judgement.
    Research suggests that meditation and awareness training can boost
    the immune system, significantly reduce stress, improve sleep,
    bolster creativity, reduce the ruminative thinking that leads
    to anxiety and depression and improve relationships with loved ones
    and friends.

    Could mindfulness be your path to less stress and greater
    wellbeing?

HELP A LOCAL FILMMAKER MAKE HIS LONDON SYMPHONY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    A brand new silent film about the culture and diversity of London,
    is set to launch a crowdfunding campaign on 16 September 2014

    LONDON SYMPHONY is a poetic journey through the city of London,
    including St Margarets, exploring its vast diversity of culture,
    religion and design via its various modes of transportation. It is
    both a cultural snapshot and a creative record of London as it
    stands today. The point is not only to immortalise the city,
    but also to celebrate its community and diversity.


    The film is being made in the style of a silent City Symphony. As
    director Alex Barrett explains: "We believe that by looking at the
    present through recourse to the past, we can learn something new
    about life today. We won't be parodying the style. We will be true
    to the spirit of the filmmakers that came before us, and we hope
    to capture the rhythm, the motion and the experimentation that made
    their films so wonderful, while simultaneously reimagining the City
    Symphony for the 21st Century".
