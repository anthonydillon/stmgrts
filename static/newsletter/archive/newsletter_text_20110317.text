QUEEN ELIZABETH'S GHOST
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The thing about ghosts is that they are unpredictable. They turn
    up when you least expect them and then they scare the living
    daylights out of you. That's how they work. You cannot set your
    watch by a ghost because ghosts do not keep to schedules or time
    tables... apart from the ghost of Queen Elizabeth 1st which is
    supposed to make an annual appearance every March 24th in the
    courtyard of Richmond Palace.

    Queen Elizabeth 1st died on Thursday March 24th 1603 at the age
    of 69. She had caught a chill a few months earlier while out
    walking and later complained of a sore throat and general aches and
    pains. Her courtiers reported that she seemed depressed. As her
    condition worsened she was brought to Richmond Palace, her "warm
    winter box" and a favourite home.

FAIRTRADE FLIES THE FLAG AT SCHOOLS' TEA PARTY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    For Fairtrade Fortnight (28 Feb - 13 March), Richmond Fairtrade
    (www.richmondfairtrade.org.uk) ran a cotton bunting competition
    for all borough schools to help the Fairtrade Foundation break the
    record for the world's longest length of hand-designed bunting - a
    massive 2.7km.

    All participating schools were invited to a tea party with the
    Deputy Mayor at which prizes were awarded to Bishop Perrin Primary,
    East Sheen Primary, St Elizabeth's Primary, Teddington Secondary,
    and Strathmore. The party was lots of fun with plenty of consumable
    Fairtrade goodies, a flag decorating workshop led by Orleans House
    Gallery and some very popular dancing mats. Over 90 metres
    of bunting were sent to the Fairtrade Foundation, who will announce
    the total length in early May.

    At Lady Eleanor Holles school teachers walked the catwalk
    in Fairtrade cotton t-shirts decorated by the girls to convey the
    message of fair trade.

BECOME A HOST
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Here is an unusual opportunity to practise a bit of international
    diplomacy in your own home.

    HOST, a well-established national charity, is looking for new
    volunteer hosts to offer the occasional one-off day, weekend or
    Christmas invitation to international students at UK universities.
    Far from their own homes, these adult students, including many
    from China, India and the USA, mostly post-grads, are keen
    to discover more about the way of life in this country,and are
    happy to share their own culture with their hosts. They all speak
    English. Volunteer hosts of all ages and walks of life are urgently
    needed. This is an interesting way to enjoy a weekend, and makes a
    worthwhile contribution to international understanding and
    goodwill.

EVENT REMINDER: REAL ALE TASTING WITH WYE VALLEY BREWERY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    This month we're pleased to have ventured a little further afield,
    and have teamed up with Hereford based, Wye Valley Brewery. Founded
    in 1985 by ex-Guinness brewer, Peter Amor, we will be joined
    by Peter's son Vernon, who trained at Youngs Brewery in Wandsworth.
    They source their ingredients locally, wherever possible, with
    their determination to constantly improve meaning they have
    attracted many awards.

    Recently they were lucky enough to win the Best Drinks Producer
    2010 .The judges were impressed by their commitment to selecting
    local Herefordshire hops, and dedication to quality
    through traditional production methods. In particular, they praised
    the 'morishness' of their beers!

    They received their award from Oz Clarke, and have since featured
    in two editions of the BBC Radio 4 Food Programme about
    the competition.

    We will be sampling their great range of different beers -
    from their Dorothy Goodbody bottled range to their seasonal cask,
    all available on the evening. Vernon will talk us through each
    of the beers as well as giving an interesting insight in to the
    brewery history and brewing process.
