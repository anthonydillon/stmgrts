HARRY HAMPTON - THE HERO OF HALIBURTON ROAD
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    If you are looking for heroes with chiselled jaws, cool 
    unflinching eyes and nerves of steel you had better start flicking
    through the pages of your old comic books -- because you won't 
    find them in real life. Most heroes are ordinary men and women 
    who just happen to do extraordinary things. There could be a hero
    or two standing behind you in the queue for the H37. There could 
    be a hero or two living in your street... there certainly was 
    in ours!
    
    Local lad Harry Hampton was 29 years old and a sergeant 
    in the King's Liverpool Regiment. On 21st August 1900, 
    in the second year of the Boer War, he rescued a small party
    of men who were under fire and heavily outnumbered by Boers 
    at Van Wyk's Vlei. During the course of the action Harry Hampton
    was twice wounded, once in the head. For his courage he was 
    awarded Britain's highest award for gallantry, 
    the Victoria Cross.
    
    After the 1st World War, during which he served as a musketry 
    instructor, Harry and his wife Gertrude came to live 
    in Haliburton Road in St Margarets. In 1922 Harry collapsed 
    on the platform at St Margarets Station and fell in front 
    of a passing train.  Although persistent gossip suggested that 
    he had committed suicide the verdict of the coroner 
    at the inquest was clear. Harry's leg had given way because
    of an old injury. He was buried in the old Burial Ground i
    n Richmond leaving behind his wife and two children: a daughter,
    Elsie and a son, also known as Harry who worked in a pub 
    in Richmond.

NSMRA -- YOUR LOCAL QUIZ INQUISITORS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The North St Margarets Residents Association is proud of some 
    of its more bizarre endeavours to help raise the spirit 
    of their community. Why go for boring whist drives and jumble 
    sales when you can unite a neighbourhood with first-run film 
    shows, re-enactments of arcane Anglo Saxon rituals, barn dances,
    skiffle classes (ask your granddad!)  and an annual street sale?
    
    The street sale is a particular favourite. Held at the end 
    of the summer the residents simply stick tables outside their 
    houses, cover them with as much bric-a-brac and object d'art
    (a.k.a junk) as they can find and then sell it to the hundreds
    of visitors who come from all over to snap up the bargains. It
    is rather like a huge car boot sale but without the car... 
    or the boot!
    
    The latest NSMRA venture into community conscious-raising is 
    a combined quiz, supper and children's film show all rolled 
    into one. While the children watch a specially picked DVD 
    in one room, their parents get down to answering some scalp 
    scratching questions in another....and even the questions are
    unusual. Unlike most other quizzes where it is hard academic
    knowledge that is being tested, the dedicated NSMRA quizzer 
    does his or her research looking at the back of corn flake 
    packets,  underneath children's toys and inside back issues 
    of 'Exchange and Mart.'
    
    The object, of course, is not to win big prizes -- because 
    there aren't any -- but to impress your neighbours by proving
    that you can tell the difference between smoky bacon and 
    cheese and onion crisps. In north St Margarets competitive 
    crisp consideration is rapidly becoming a major spectator 
    sport!
    
    The NSMRA Quiz Night is on Saturday June 21st at the Church 
    Hall in Northcote Road.
    
    The Great Annual Street Sale - GASS takes place in and around 
    Haliburton Road on the afternoon of Saturday 6th September.
