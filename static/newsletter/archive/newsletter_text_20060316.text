Tesco Appeals Advertising Signage Decision
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Tesco is appealing the Richmond Council Planning Committee's 
    refusal for their second request for permission on its existing
    advertising signage. This appeal is based on the grounds that; the 
    planning officers originally recommend permission for it in the
    first application, that other stores on St Margaret Road have 
    largely the same signage and other Councils across the country 
    have approved of the signage for similar stores.

Letter from ParVinu
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    We are very pleased that we received approval for our planning

    committee vindicates the tremendous amount of research and energy
    we have put in to make sure that our proposal was both sympathetic 
    in it's approach and professional in it's execution.
