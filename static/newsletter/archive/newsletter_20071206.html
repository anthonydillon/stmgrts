<h2>Latest News</h2>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2007/12/event_reminder_crown_road_christmas_fair.html">Event Reminder: Crown Road Christmas Fair</a></h3>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2007/12/cpz_update.html"><span class="caps">CPZ</span> Update</a></h3>

<p>I hope all of you who are concerned about the spread of <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CPZ </span></span></span>in St. Margaret&#8217;s read this so you know what is happening currently.  I was informed the night two nights ago that the council would be holding an unpublicised meeting on 4 December, 7PM, Winchester Hall, St Margarets at which the street and signage design of a &#8220;trial consultation&#8221; in a newly proposed <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">CPZ </span></span>in St Margarets would be decided by &#8220;invited&#8221; residents.</p>

<p>As you may know, last summer the council sent a questionnaire to all of the households in the originally proposed <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CPZ </span></span></span>in St. Margarets.  65% of household voted against the <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">CPZ </span></span>and 36.8% said they wanted it.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, Councillor Trigg unilaterally (without any consultation with residents) decided that the original zone would be subdivided forming a new zone which would include a large proportion of streets that had voted for <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CPZ, </span></span></span>but also embedded in that new zone would be streets that had voted resoundingly against it.  And, that this newly proposed zone would be the subject of a trial <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">CPZ </span></span>consultation.  There was no formal communication regarding this decision to anyone residing either in the new zone or to the remaining households who formed the rest of the originally proposed zone.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2007/12/chess_trattoria_pasta_pizza_opens.html">Ches&#39;s Trattoria Pasta &amp; Pizza Opens</a></h3>

<p>Ches&#8217;s Cafe is to become Ches&#8217;s Trattoria Pasta &amp; Pizza as of Monday 3rd December. A new dining area downstairs from Ches&#8217;s Cafe has been created almost single handedly by owner Tony over the last year. The restaurant features include a genuine traditional wood burning Pizza Oven made in Italy and installed by Romans, with modern decor throughout and a summer conservatory which is sure to be a big hit with Pizza connoisseurs. Opening Hours will be 6-10.30 Monday to Saturday and the premises are currently unlicensed so please bring a bottle or two of Peroni.</p>

<p>Please support this new and exciting local project which will provide the good folk of St Margarets with another exciting gastronomic experience.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2007/12/the_school_on_shuhada_street.html">The School on Shuhada Street</a></h3>

<div class="box"><em>This is the fourth dispatch from Gill Swain, a local writer who has <a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2007/09/local_writer_works_for_peace_in_palestine.html">traveled to Palestine</a> to work for peace with the World Council of Churches </em>.</div>

<p>Our team&#8217;s main task as Ecumenical Accompaniers in Hebron is to watch over Palestinian children as they go to and from Cordoba school on Shuhada Street. Every morning at 7.15 two of us stand at the bottom of a steep flight of stone steps which leads up a slope to the school.</p>

<p>Directly opposite there is the settlement of Beit Hadassah, home to 30 or so Israeli families, an infant school and a museum. And almost every morning we arrive to find a car belonging to one of the settlers parked as close as it is possible to get to the bottom of the steps, forcing the Palestinian children to squeeze past it one at a time.</p>

<p>This is just a mean and petty gesture compared to the stone throwing, spitting and screams of abuse which the children often suffered from the settlers over the years but it is a little bit of daily harassment nonetheless.</p>
