LATEST NEWS
===========================================================



ï»¿GASS DAY IS COMING - 6 SEPTEMBER 2014
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    There are times when the stuff that we accumulate around ourselves
    threatens to take over our lives. Shelves groan under the weight
    of unread books and record racks creak with unplayed CDs. Cupboards
    are stuffed with things that we don't even know we had and
    wardrobes are hung with clothes that went out of fashion when David
    Bowie abandoned the 3 inch stack heel for lounge suits. What can we
    do about it all? There are 3 possible solutions:

    1. Do nothing until the neighbours wonder, "Whatever happened 
     to old so-and-so?" and our bodies are found buried under a mountain
     of David Cassidy albums, Dan Brown books and rusting Swiss
     Fondue sets.
    2. Take everything to your local charity shop
    3. Take it all to GASS and sell it.

IN THEIR FOOTSTEPS: RICHMOND'S FIRST WORLD WAR - ORLEANS HOUSE GALLERY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    This exhibition, created by young people, launches the borough's
    four-year commemoration of the First World War Centenary.

    The exhibition focuses on the First World War heritage of the
    London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. Working with photographer
    Othello De Souza Hartley and designer Jasleen Kaur, young people
    have explored the stories and histories through people and places
    and the impact of the War in the locality. These stories have been
    brought to life through objects, artworks, creative writing and
    photographic recreations of narrative events.
