<p><em>9 February 2012</em></p>

<p>Welcome to the St Margarets Community Website Newsletter (<a href="https://stmargarets.london">stmargarets.london</a>). Occasional Thursdays we will send you the latest news and events from the website.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2012/02/the_temporary_rules_of_golf.html">The Temporary Rules of Golf</a></h3>

<div class="box">

Let me begin by stating that I do not play golf, I know nothing about the game and I care even less.  My only feeling about the sport is they should make the holes bigger and the greens shorter. (In the name of journalistic balance I should add that I did once act as caddie for Tony Jacklin when he was assistant professional at Potters Bar Golf Club in the early 60&#39;s. I was sacked for <em>&#39;not taking the game seriously&#39;</em>. Not taking what seriously? People with expensive sticks knocking little balls into holes in the ground?)<br />
</div>

<p>Golf has many stories and jokes associated with it. Here&#39;s an example&#39;.</p>

<p><img src="https://stmargarets.london/assets/images/2012/GOLF_vintage-golf-photo_thumb.jpg" width="150" height="112" alt="Vintage golf photo" align="right" style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 1px;" /></p>

<p><span class="caps">GOLFER</span> 1: <em>I&#39;ve got a golf ball that is impossible to lose.</em><br />
<span class="caps">GOLFER</span> 2: <em>Really?</em><br /><br /><br />
<span class="caps">GOLFER</span> 1: <em>Yes. Knock it into water and it floats. It glows in the dark and has a radio tracking device and <span class="caps">GPS </span>system built into it. It is specially scented to draw tracker dogs - and if you hit it into long grass it cries out &#39;Over here! Over here!&#39;</em><br /><br />

<span class="caps">GOLFER</span> 2: <em>That&#39;s fantastic! Where did you get it?</em><br /><br /><br />
<span class="caps">GOLFER</span> 1: <em>I found it!</em></p>

<p>(Loud rattling noise as people with expensive sticks collapse on ground with laughter.)</p>

<p><img src="https://stmargarets.london/assets/images/2012/GOFL_ww2_heinkel_bombers_thumb.jpg" width="150" height="203" alt="WWII Heinkel Bombers" align="right" style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 1px;" /></p>

<p>One of the most popular golf stories is the one about the set of Temporary Rules drawn up by Richmond Golf Club during the early days of the Second World War. It goes like this&#39;</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1940, towards the end of the Battle of Britain, the German Luftwaffe stopped targeting <span class="caps">RAF </span>airfields and directed its bombers to attack London and other major cities. As a result bombs fell onto the golf course in Richmond Park and destroyed a laundry used by Richmond Golf Club. (One source suggests this happened on 9<sup>th</sup> September 1940.) Realising that enemy attack could seriously disrupt a game of golf the club secretary drew up a set of rules to cope with any unexpected eventuality&#39;</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2012/02/linked_primary_schools_to_be_scrapped_for_orleans.html">Linked Primary Schools to be Scrapped for Orleans Park from 2013</a></h3>

<p>As expected, the February 6 meeting of the Richmond Upon Thames Admissions Forum decided (9 to 2, 4 abstentions) to recommend &#39;that Cabinet should approve the proposal to remove the links&#39; for September 2013 admissions and beyond, affecting current year five and below.</p>

<p>This will make places at Orleans Park available to the East Twickenham children who attend the Vineyard school and Catholic schools. No-one can say how far the catchment area will extend northwards into north St Margaret&#39;s; one forecast is &#39;Pupils who were at one of the former link schools but live more than about 1.5 km away [will] definitely not get into <span class="caps">OPS</span>&#39;</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2012/02/mogden_works_to_improve_capacity_50_by_march_2013.html">Mogden Works to Improve Capacity 50% by March 2013</a></h3>

<p>The half-way line to completion has been crossed in the &pound;140m improvement work at Mogden Sewage Treatment Works. Thames Water remains on track to finish work to boost the site&#39;s treatment capacity by 50 per cent by the end of March 2013, helping it to cope with heavy rainfall.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2012/02/event_reminder_celebrate_orleans_infants_new_hall.html">Event Reminder: Celebrate Orleans Infant&#39;s New Hall - 24 February 2012</a></h3>

<p><img src="https://stmargarets.london/assets/images/2012/Orleans_fake_tan_poster_thumb.jpg" width="150" height="216" alt="Orleans fake tan poster" align="right" style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 1px;" /></p>

<p>The Orleans Infant School <span class="caps">PTA </span>(FOOI) has booked St Margarets favourites Fake Tan on 24<sup>th</sup> February to celebrate the opening of the new school hall. Tickets are &pound;20 and include a glass of bubbly and Indian snacks. Funds raised will be put towards a new outdoor writing classroom to accommodate thirty children - the classroom should really help to motivate the children and there is good evidence that learning outdoors in particularly effective for boys.</p>

<p>We look forward to seeing you.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2012/02/still_wondering_what_to_do_for_midterm_break_next.html">Still Wondering What To Do For Mid-Term Break Next Week?</a></h3>

<p>What about a 5 day filmmaking course where children get the chance to make their own film under instruction from industry professionals?</p>

<h4><span class="caps">LAST FEW PLACES LEFT</span>!!</h4>

<p>Dreamcatcher Media have been running Summer holiday and mid-term break film camps for several years now in Twickenham, Notting Hill and Elstree. Children learn the basics of film production including scripting, directing, camerawork and sound. They then form a production team to make their own short movie under instruction from professionals and get to play the different production roles including director, sound operator and cameraperson. It&#39;s a great learning experience!</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2012/02/new_local_free_secondary_school_for_twickenham_pro.html">New Local Free Secondary School for Twickenham Proposed</a></h3>

<p>A local parent steering group has joined forces with an educational trust to create a proposal for an 11-18 secondary free school in the Twickenham area.</p>

<p>The <em>New Local School for Twickenham Steering Group</em> is proposing an innovative and inspirational community school, committed to the highest possible standards, delivering a broad and balanced curriculum and valuing the achievements and aspirations of every pupil.</p>

<p>Spokesperson, Beverley Sanders, said &#39;Our children have a great start at local primary schools, but there is a strain on capacity that is pushing its way into secondary provision. We know that there is a need for more secondary capacity in the near future. The Free School legislation can enable local parents to shape the decisions, and secure government funding to create the kind of new school that local people want. We will work with the council to ensure that our proposed school makes a positive contribution to their existing family of schools, and becomes a hub for its local community&#39;.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2012/02/st_stephens_table_top_sale_3_march_2012.html">St Stephen&#39;s Table Top Sale - 3 March 2012</a></h3>

<p>It&#39;s the perfect time for a good Spring clean, so why not clear out all those unwanted clothes, bikes, toys and household goods&#39; they may be just what someone else is looking for&#39; and could earn you some extra<br />
cash.</p>

<p>Tea, coffee, cold drinks and snacks will be on sale. Money raised from the sale of spaces and refreshments will go towards a Smarter St Stephen&#39;s campaign to refurbish the school hall. Additional  donations always gratefully received.</p>
