GOVERNOR VACANCY FOR ORLEANS PRIMARY SCHOOL
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Orleans Primary School has a vacancy for a Local Authority
    Governor. Governors are vital to the running of the school and it
    is exciting being involved in new developments, helping the school
    improve and meet its targets. Having recently retained our
    outstanding rating by Ofsted, the school is striving to maintain
    these high standards and continue to improve while ensuring the
    successful transition to a 2 form entry primary school. Governors
    need to have the time to commit to full governors meetings,
    committee meetings and other tasks, at least some of which take
    place during school hours. We are looking for individuals who have
    particular skills or interest in finance and in health and safety,
    but most of all we need someone who is passionate about
    school improvement.

    Please note that Local Authority governors should not be parents or
    staff of the school.

    If you are interested, please contact the school office on 020 8892
    1654 or governors@orleans.richmond.sch.uk
