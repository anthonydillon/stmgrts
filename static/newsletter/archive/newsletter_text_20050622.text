LATEST NEWS
===========================================================

CAN RECYCLING REALLY REALLY HELP THE COMMUNITY?
-----------------------------------------------------------
    In March the St Margarets' Traders Association applied for the 
    right to adopt the Barron's Road recycling site for the purpose 
    of encouraging recycling with the added benefit of having some 
    extra income to fund civic projects.
    
    The council has rejected this request, apparently the site wasn't 
    enough of a 'problem', despite the good it would have done for the 
    community.
    
    What can you do to help?

CLOWNS DESCEND ON JUBILEE GARDENS PLAYGROUND
-----------------------------------------------------------
    To help celebrate the first phase of the Twickenham Riverside 
    regeneration, Zippos Circus and the Richmond Council are offering a 
    free clown show at the newly opened Jubilee Gardens Playground this 
    Saturday, June 25th at 11:30am.

TESCO, STOP PUSHING AROUND ST MARGARETS
-----------------------------------------------------------
    A local group called SPASM (for Stop Pushing Around St Margarets) 
    has been actively campaigning to make local Tesco conform with 
    existing regulations and making sure the Richmond Council doesn't 
    pander to the retail giants whims unfairly.

ST MARGARETS COMMUNITY EVENT SEPTEMBER 2005
-----------------------------------------------------------
    A partnership of local traders, residents and school PTA's are 
    currently planning a community event to be held in Crown Road in 
    September, the exact date is still to be confirmed. The event will 
    be aimed at raising funds for local projects and charities.
    
    However, now is the time for local groups looking for some extra 
    funds to start submitting ideas to Simon at Cutters.
