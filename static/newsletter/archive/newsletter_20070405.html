<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2007/04/marble_hill_caf_to_open_again.html">Marble Hill Caf&eacute; to Open Again</a></h3>

<p><em>Paul Lamplugh wins Campaign to Save Diana&#8217;s Caf&eacute;</em></p>

<p>Paul Lamplugh OBE, now 75, father of missing estate agent Suzy Lamplugh, who disappeared without trace in 1986, has not only taken on and won a campaign to have the historic Coach House Caf&eacute; in Marble Hill Park, re-opened, he also plans to run it.</p>

<p>Asked why he felt so strongly about the Caf&eacute;, Paul says:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Sadly, due to a massive stroke in 2003, my wife Diana has been in hospital nearby in Twickenham for the last few years and for two years I took her out from the hospital to this caf&eacute; everyday. It&#8217;s a delightful place in a beautiful park and was a lovely treat for us both, so I was very disappointed when English Heritage had to close the cafe in February 2006 because it was making a loss.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Paul determined to have the cafe re-opened for Diana and all the other visitors to the park who enjoy it and he got together with local residents to start a campaign.</p>

<p>The campaign was a success and Paul and local resident Jenni Dunn won the contract for it. The Coach House Caf&eacute;, to be run for local people as a not-for-profit concern, opens fully on Good Friday, 6th April.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2007/04/furniture_scheme_plans_three_more_open_days.html">Furniture Scheme Plans Three More Open Days</a></h3>

<p>The <a href="https://stmargarets.london/directory/charity/200703111434">Furniture Scheme Richmond upon Thames</a> collects donated furniture for the primary purpose of making it available to people in need. However, we always have surplus furniture and are keen to ensure that this gets reused. With this in mind we have decided to open to the general public. This has two purposes:</p>


<ol>
<li>to help us increase the rotation of  furniture in and out of the warehouse so we reuse more and reduce the amount going to landfill</li>
<li>to help us generate some much-needed funds to keep going</li>
</ol>



<p>To give working people an opportunity to get to know us we are opening  (with the help of volunteers) on the first Saturday of the following months for two hours from 10am-12pm:</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="https://stmargarets.london/event/Meeting/200704050218">Saturday, 5<sup>th</sup> May 2007</a></li>
<li><a href="https://stmargarets.london/event/Meeting/200704050220">Saturday, 2<sup>nd</sup> June 2007</a></li>

<li><a href="https://stmargarets.london/event/Meeting/200704050219">Saturday, 7<sup>th</sup> July 2007</a></li>
</ul>



<p><em>This is a three-month experiment only.</em></p>

<p>However the Furniture Scheme is  also open to the target group referred to above 10am-3pm Mondays to Thursdays &#8212; our usual opening hours.</p>

<p>The furniture we collect is of a good quality.  You may find something special.  Come and visit us and see for yourself.</p>
