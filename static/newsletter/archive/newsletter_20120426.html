<blockquote><p>&#8220;Hounslow, whose heath sublimer terror fills,<br />
Shall with her gibbets lend her powder mills.&#8221;</p>

<p><cite>WILLIAM MASON &#8220;Heroic Epistle&#8221; 1773</cite></p>

<p>There were two things that must have depressed people living around these parts in the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries. The first was the likelihood of being robbed by highwaymen and footpads on Hounslow Heath. The second was the real possibility of being blown up by any one of the many gunpowder mills operating along the River Crane.</p>

<p>Although it is difficult to prove, it does seem that this area has had a long association with explosives&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p><em>Agreed sale will see the studios&#39; work continue and all jobs saved, say administrators</em></p>

<p>Campaigners attempting to avert the closure of Twickenham Film Studios are holding their breath after it was announced on Tuesday that a sale had been agreed to save the site, but the buyer&#39;s identity would remain secret until the deal had gone through.</p>

<p>Gerald Krasner, administrator for the studios, said: &#8220;It is the purchaser&#39;s intention to continue to trade as studios and to preserve all the jobs.&#8221; He said the buyer had handed over a non-returnable deposit of &#163;100,000, but would not reveal the full purchase price.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2012/04/letter_from_twickenham_residents_action_group_25_a.html">Letter from Twickenham Residents Action Group - 25 April 2012</a></h3>

<p><em>editor&#39;s note: we received this email and are posting as is, as we cannot prove the allegations in the letter, but believe it deserves publishing.</em></p>

<div class="letter">

<p>Dear Editor,</p>

<p>Lord True (Leader of Richmond Council) and the Planning Office have covered-up a highly critical report, produced by their own advisory group, concerning the residential development over Twickenham Railway Station.</p>

<p>The detailed and extensive report (+80 pages) was prepared by the Twickenham Advisory Panel (TAP). Lord True formed TAP to act as an &#39;honest broker&#39; - providing a forum for open dialogue between the community and the developer (Solum). The report was prepared to follow up the questions raised during the public consultation event held at Richmond College in July 2011.</p>

<p>I would like the help of your readers to  obtain answers to some very basic questions from:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lord True - <em>Leader of Richmond Council</em> - <a href="mailto:Cllr.LordTrue@richmond.gov.uk">Cllr.LordTrue@richmond.gov.uk</a></li>
<li>Paul Chadwick - <em>Council Director of Environment</em> - <a href="mailto:P.Chadwick@richmond.gov.uk">P.Chadwick@richmond.gov.uk</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>When was the LBRuT first in possession of the TAP report?</li>
<li>Why did Lord True and the Planning Office decide not to include the TAP report with the documents provided for the Planning Meeting held on 19<sup>th</sup> December 2011?</li>
<li>Why was the TAP spokesman barred from the Planning Meeting even though he had registered to speak?</li>
<li>When will TAP&#39;s recommendations be made public?</li>
</ol>

<p>I am sure your readers will have their own questions.</p>

<p>We are only likely to get a response with force of numbers.</p>

<p>The only way we can challenge the impact of the cover up is via a judicial review. TRAG has raised the funding for the first stage in just two weeks (+&pound;10,000 to obtain an opinion on the case for a judicial review). We would welcome further contributions to our legal fund:</p>

<p><a href="http://trag-sos.co.uk/">trag-sos.co.uk</a></p>

<p>(Paypal link is at the bottom of page for credit/debit card contributions)</p>

<p>I will send you a link to a downloadable version of the complete document (including recommendations) as soon as it is made available.</p>

<p>Best regards,</p>

<p><em>Ian Blackman</em><br />
Twickenham Residents Action Group (TRAG)  - not TAP</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2012/04/dreamcatcher_film_camps_to_survive_twickenham_stud.html">Dreamcatcher Film Camps to Survive Twickenham Studios Closure</a></h3>

<p>You may have heard about the impending closure of Twickenham Film Studios and wondered what&#39;s happening to our Film Camps this summer. Well, although we&#39;re very sad to see the demise of such historic studios, we&#39;re delighted to announce that we have now found a smart new home for our Camps at Falcons Boys School in the heart of Richmond.</p>

<p>We&#39;re very grateful to our new sponsors the Alpha Plus Group who are accomodating us at the school for the summer. It has excellent facilities for children and already we can see how its many indoor and enclosed outdoor spaces will be used imaginatively by our aspiring young filmmakers! With Richmond Station just 5 minutes walk away, the school offers excellent transport links via the District Line, London Overground and South West trains, along with a range of local bus routes.</p>

<p>Our Easter Film Camp at the school was a great success. Our Summer Film Camps begin on the 9<sup>th</sup> July and will run every week Monday to Friday until 31<sup>st</sup> August. Start and finishing times will remain the same at 9am and 2pm respectively.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2012/04/i_love_to_hear_a_choir.html">I Love to Hear a Choir!</a></h3>

<p><img src="https://stmargarets.london/assets/images/2012/choir_GRAPHIC_thumb.jpg" width="150" height="76" alt="choir" align="right" /></p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;I love to hear a choir. I love to see the faces of real people devoting themselves to a piece of music. I like the teamwork. It makes me feel optimistic about the human race!&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><cite>PAUL McCARTNEY</cite></p>

<p>Singing in choirs is good for you too - whether you are performing Handel&#39;s &#39;Messiah&#39;, clapping along to Gospel or pumping out some seductive &#39;shang-a-langs&#39; in a doo-wop quartet. Choral singing opens the airways, develops the voice and instils confidence. Above all choir singing is fun and you don&#39;t need any experience or read music to do it. Essentially it is about joining friends to make a joyous noise - be it Bach, the Beatles or Beyonc&#233;!</p>

<p>Now a new and local Community Choir is starting in St Margarets to raise that friendly, joyous noise&#8230;and the roof as well. They meet on Wednesday afternoons during term-time at All Souls Church, Northcote Rd, from 1-3pm. to sing songs from many eras and cultures including Jazz, Pop and World music.  There will also be breathing and vocal exercises to help stretch and develop the voice.</p>

<p>The cost is &pound;10 per session, but discounts are available. Please phone Surya on 07770 993289, or email <a href="mailto:%69%6E%66%6F%40%76%69%74%61%6C%76%6F%69%63%65%73%2E%63%6F%2E%75%6B">info@vitalvoices.co.uk</a></p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Come lift your voices and sing as one.<br />
Let&#39;s raise the roof - and have some fun!&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2012/04/help_hands_donate_baby_and_childrens_clothing.html">Help HANDS - Donate Baby and Children&#39;s Clothing</a></h3>

<p>At HANDS (Help a neighbour in distress) we are planning to hold a <em>Baby &amp; Child clothing sale</em>. We are therefore looking for donations of Pre-loved, good quality child &amp; baby clothing.</p>

<p>Donations can be dropped to HANDS, Bath House, Twickenham, TW1 3DX between 9.30 and 12.30 or to Petit Bateau, 56 High Street, Richmond-upon-Thames, TW9 1TW (To discuss the possibility of a local collection please phone Maxine - 07719938889).</p>

<p>All money raised will go towards running costs of the Help a Neighbour in Distress Scheme. &#39;HANDS&#39; aims to improve the quality of life for people living in the areas of Twickenham &amp; St Margarets by giving friendly, practical help to those in need (Charity No. 1033694).</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2012/04/local_job_vacancy_sessional_playworker_toy_library.html">Local Job Vacancy: Sessional Playworker, Toy Library</a></h3>

<p>The Toy library has an extensive catalogue which includes baby toys, construction toys, dressing up, role play, books, sensory toys and more.</p>

<p>Borrowing rather than buying toys is a green way of introducing children to new experiences, helping to shrink families&#39; carbon footprint. It is also an easier way for children to experience new toys without the expense. Our toy library currently holds sessions at 6 Children&#39;s Centre&#39;s and is continuing to grow.</p>

<p>Marble Hill Playcentres is looking for a Sessional Playworker, who is passionate about Play, to work at our Toy library.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2012/04/taylor_wimpey_withdraw_bid_for_twickenham_film_stu.html">Taylor Wimpey Withdraw Bid for Twickenham Film Studios</a></h3>

<p>A property developer has withdrawn its bid for Twickenham Film Studios because it said it wants to give film consortiums a chance to buy and maintain the site.</p>

<p>Members of the Save Twickenham Film Studios campaign said they were delighted with Taylor Wimpey&#39;s announcement but were aware that the fight to save the studios, which played host to classics including Alfie and The Italian Job, was not over.</p>

<p>Campaign leader Maria Walker said:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;The CEO has agreed to back-off to give it a chance to be kept as a studio.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have won the battle; the fight is still not over.</p>

<p>&#8220;We want to get the message to a developer that does think they can get in - we will fight. In fact if anything, the campaign is growing, so it has not gone away.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2012/04/primary_school_offers_day_91_get_a_school_of_their.html">Primary School Offers Day - 91% Get a School of Their Choice</a></h3>

<p>As demand for primary school places reaches an all time high, more in-borough applicants than in previous years have been offered a place at one of their preferred schools - 91% compared with 89% in 2011.</p>

<p>On 18 April 2012, Richmond Council will be making the initial allocation of reception class offers for this September: 75% have been offered a place at their first preference primary school, a rise from last year&#39;s figure of 73.5%; 88% have been offered a place at one of their top three preferred schools, compared with 86% last year. Those who have not been offered any of their preferences will have been offered an alternative - or will be offered one in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>To meet demand for places, last year the Council announced additional investment to expand the borough&#39;s primary schools, as part of a 10 year strategy. This year, an additional three permanent forms of entry, for 90 additional children, will be provided at Hampton Wick Infant, Orleans Primary, St Stephen&#39;s C of E Primary, and St Mary&#39;s C of E Primary. The provision of the 60 additional places within St Margarets and central/East Twickenham has been particularly helpful in greatly reducing the number of children in those areas who would otherwise have been unplaced at the initial allocations stage.</p>
