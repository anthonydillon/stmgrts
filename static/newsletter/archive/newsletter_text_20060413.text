:: ST MARGARETS COMMUNITY WEBSITE NEWSLETTER :: 

13 April 2006

Welcome to the St Margarets Community Website Newsletter. 
Each Thursday we will send you the latest news and events from the website (http://www.stmgrts.org.uk).

LATEST NEWS
===========================================================




THE EASTER LINDT?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    We just had a call from the manager of Gift. Apparently they have 
    just had a huge delivery of Lindt Luxury Easter eggs, all are being 
    sold at 40% less than Tesco or Superdrug.
    
    Gift wondered if we would like to hold a special draw for those 
    members who have signed up for the newsletter (since we forgot to 
    update the site with a new offer this month), with the lucky reader 
    winning a Lindt Luxury Egg.

    The 40% reduction offer is, I am told, also available at Cutters.
    
    So we have had a draw and emailed one reader; hopefully, they will 
    allow us to post their details.

    Lynda Vartuli and Glen Cardno have been on a whirlwind shopping 
    trip to the States to bring back the latest must-have accessories

WHO IS THE ST MARGARETS ASSOCIATION OF RESIDENTS?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    After posting the Reply to Residents Group Letter on Proposed 
    Indoor Soft Play Area article, we recieved a  number of emails 
    asking who the St Margarets Association of Residents was, so we 
    asked them to pass along some information.

    Turns out they didn't have a website, so we have hosted a page for 
    them.

HEATHROW EXPANSION CONCERNS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The new Terminal 5 at Heathrow Airport and any increase in flights 
    and changes to the flight paths will have an impact to the 
    St Margarets' area and the quality of life we currently enjoy.  
    The Hacan Organisation is a formidable pressure group making waves 
    within Central government and at the European court.

LETTERS TO AMERICA : THE PROPERTY MARKET & THE FRENCH
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    When our daughter first heard we were considering moving from the 
    US to England, she just couldn't stop laughing. She thought it was
    a joke. Nevertheless, we are here and the things that are 
    different are not necessarily what we anticipated...
