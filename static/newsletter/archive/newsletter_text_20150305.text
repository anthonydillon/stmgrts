===========================================================



ï»¿RYLANCE, RUGBY AND REVELATIONS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    In 1986 a young actor was struggling with a difficult decision.
    Should he take up a tempting offer from Steven Spielberg to appear
    in his forthcoming feature film "The Empire of the Sun" or accept
    an invitation to join the company at the National Theatre? As Mark
    Rylance explained recently on "Desert Island Discs" he only made
    his decision after consulting the 'I Ching' , or 'Book of Changes"
    - a familiar feature on many bookshelves in the 1960's alongside
    "The Prophet" by Kahil Gibran and the Desiderata... "Go placidly
    amid the noise and the haste etc etc"


    "I turned to the 'I Ching' and you just ask it, 'Where now?' And
     the answer it gave if I went to the theatre was 'Community', and
     that swayed it for me. I had never experienced community on
     film sets."
