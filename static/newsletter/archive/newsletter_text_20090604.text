DON'T FORGET TO VOTE: EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ELECTIONS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Residents are reminded not to miss their chance to vote 
    on Thursday, 4 June 2009, in the European Elections, as every vote 
    will count in deciding the eight London Members of the 
    European Parliament.
    
    The European Parliament is made up of 736 Members (MEPs) elected 
    by 27 EU member countries. In the UK, there are 12 European 
    electoral regions represented by between three and ten MEPs making
    a total of 72 MEPs. Prior to EU expansion, this number of MEPs
    was 78.
    
    MEPs spend some of their time in their regional constituencies 
    in the UK and some of their time in political meetings in Brussels.
    For one week in every month they go to Strasbourg to debate and
    vote on new European laws with MEPs from other EU member countries.

THE DAY WAR BROKE OUT
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    The day war broke out... my Missus said to me... she looked 
    at me and she said, "What good are you?"
    
    I said, "Who?"
    
    She said, "You!"
    
    I said, "How do you mean, what good am I?"
    
    "Well..." she said, "You're too old for the army..." she said, 
    "You couldn't get in the navy... and they wouldn't have you 
    in the air force... so, what good are you?"
    
    I said," I'll do something!..."

    Just before 11.00am on the morning of Sunday 3rd September 1939
    the people of Britain gathered around their wireless sets 
    to listen to a very important announcement from the Prime Minister,
    Neville Chamberlain. Gardeners put down their tools and came 
    indoors. Golfers cut short their game and returned to the 
    clubhouse. Ministers brought radios into their churches or made 
    arrangements for the news to be read out the moment it was 
    received. It came at 11.15...

TRAINING FOR AN ENDURANCE RACE: PHASE 1 - BASE TRAINING
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    This phase builds on strength and stamina and is essential 
    to prevent injury. The key areas during this phase are to build 
    slowly. As I have 10 months left to work towards running the 
    Marathon des Sables I need to focus on consistency in training 
    and building on the miles per week. I will therefore look 
    at doing the following weekly training programme over the 
    next 8-10 weeks.
    
    * Easy run, building up to 5-6 miles by the end of the 10 weeks.
    * Resistant workout, plus 10 minutes of abdominal work.
    * Easy run of 4-5 miles including hills. So by the end of the 
      10 weeks I am mainly running hills for 5 miles, or doing 
      repeat hills.
    * Resistant workout as above with an optional cross training
      session for about 40 minutes.
    * REST
    * Long slow run with pack for 90 plus minutes, with slowly
      building up distance and speed.
    * REST or recovery run for 2/3 miles.

    The resistance work will help strengthen my quads, hamstrings 
    and core muscles to prepare for the long runs. Whilst during these
    long runs, I will need to incorporate hiking and running as few 
    elite ultra runners run for the full duration if the race is
    over 50 miles.
    
    I'll cover each particular training phase, strategies to cope 
    with long runs, eating on the run and other key tips over the 
    next few weeks. I will be doing this for 2 charities (F.R.O.D.O.
    and Against Malaria) as it will keep me going in the toughest
    moments both during training and in the race. If you want 
    to keep up with my training then visit 
    www.run.uk.net/training diary
    
    If you want to get fit for summer, why not try early morning
    bootcamps? The next bootcamp starts on Monday 8th June. Visit 
    www.run.uk.net for more information or call Georgie 
    on 07736 070612.
