PUBLIC NOTICE FOR 141  143 ST MARGARET'S ROAD
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    A reader alerted this website of the following public notice .  It
    is regarding a space behind the Taylor'd Lighting on St Margarets
    Road that Richmond Council intends to give up ownership and 
    maintenance of the land as a road.  Currently the space is used 
    for parking, people turning their cars or kids playing.
    
    Highways Act 1980 - Section 116 and Schedule 12 - Public Highway 
    at the rear of 141-143 St Margaret's Road, Twickenham - Removal 
    of part of the public highway
    
    NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that the Council of the London Borough 
    of Richmond upon Thames being the Highway Authority for the 
    highway hereinafter mentioned intend to apply to the Magistrates'
    Court sitting at Richmond, Surrey, on Thursday the 18 day 
    of January 2007 at the hour of 10:00 o'clock for an Order 
    under Section 116 of the Highways Act 1980 authorising that

CAN YOU HELP?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Do you know of a cubbie hole available to rent at a good price?
    
    For the last 9 years The David Adams Leukaemia Appeal Fund has 
    operated out of a tiny 'shoe-box' office at 120 St Margarets Road 
    for a peppercorn rent.  Sadly notice has been given owing 
    to the planned re-development of the building.  This has come
    as a great shock to the staff who have only 2 months to find 
    alternative quarters.
    
    The charity run by Mandie Adams McGuire raises money for The Royal 
    Marsden Hospital.  They raise between L100,000 and L140,000 
    annually, and have raised many hundreds of thousands of pounds 
    over the last thirteen years. They are proud to have funded two 
    research posts during this period, one in the Leukaemia Unit, 
    looking into Autologous Bone Marrow Transplantation, and one in
    the Children's Cancer Unit, studying the molecular analysis 
    of all cases of childhood leukaemia presenting to the hospital.
    In addition they have paid for items of equipment and last year,
    funded the patients' Christmas party on the Leukaemia Unit.
