﻿FROM ZIPPY TO ZERDIN
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    A couple of weeks ago a young ventriloquist from Wimbledon competed
    in the finals of 'America's Got Talent' - the most popular TV
    talent show in the world - and won. His name is Paul Zerdin and he
    picked up $1 million in prize money and a contract at the Planet
    Hollywood Resort and Casino in Las Vegas.

GOODBYE MUM AND DAD, HELLO DEBT?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    St Margarets parent Hilary Thomson looks at the student living
    costs behind the headlines

    As you wave a fond (or relieved) farewell to your son or daughter
    as they leave for university this month you may well be thinking
    nostalgically of your own student days. However, while your child's
    student experience may resemble yours in some respects (alcohol,
    music, an all-consuming interest in their social life, a new life
    in a new town) there are two respects in which it will be very
    different indeed: the cost of going away to university and the
    challenge of money management.

    While student life was heavily subsidised for the previous
    generation, a brief visit to any UK campus quickly reveals how the
    tide has turned.

    "What's a refectory?" said my son as I peered at the Starbucks
    coffee shop on his campus, where a coffee appeared to cost … well …
    the same as it would cost in Richmond.

    From there on in, despite blandishments of 'student deals' your
    child is essentially a captive cash cow, often paying over the odds
    at a campus supermarket and commercial rates for everything
    from leisure events to laundry, beer to bus fares.

    Interviewed on BBC Radio 4's You and Yours' recent programme on the
    cost of a university education, I pointed out that amidst the
    hubbub about 9k pounds tuition fees, pundits and parents alike often
    overlook the sheer scale of students' everyday living costs.

ART CLUBS AT ORLEANS HOUSE GALLERY - AUTUMN 2015
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Exciting weekly workshops offer budding young artists the
    opportunity to explore a broad range of artistic media and practice
    with our experienced gallery artists. Each term brings a varied
    selection of projects which are explored in group sizes of no more
    than sixteen, allowing participants to try more messy and
    adventurous media than may be possible at school.

    Often taking inspiration from Gallery exhibitions or the work
    of other artists, our Art Club members benefit from being given
    creative opportunities in a relaxing and inspiring environment.

    Autumn Term Art Clubs take place from the week beginning 14
    September until the week beginning 7 December, with a week off
    for half term in the week beginning 26 October.

STAR CLUB AT ORLEANS HOUSE GALLERY - AUTUMN 2015
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    A series of after school workshops for 4 to 7 year olds combining
    movement, story telling, music and art. Taking inspiration from the
    exhibition and surrounding natural environment of Orleans House
    Gallery, we will learn about creative performance making,
    communication and group work, building to a small showcase.

TURNER'S HOUSE EXHIBITION - 26 TO 27 SEPTEMBER AND 3 OCTOBER 2015
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    It is not surprising that many Friends of Turner's House are
    artists. Many, inspired by the great landscape artist, have had the
    thrill of sketching and painting in Sandycombe Lodge, Turner's
    unique country villa in Twickenham.

    They are holding a selling exhibition of their work to benefit
    Turner's House Trust restoration fund to restore the house to the
    artist's original design.

    The exhibition takes place on Saturday 26th and Sunday 27th
    September (11-5pm) and Saturday 3rd October (2-4pm). 3rd October is
    the last day Turner's House will be open to visitors prior
    to closing for restoration through 2016. Entry to the exhibition is
    free on all days, but for guided tours of the house on 3rd October
    there will be the usual 4 pounds entry fee. 

    The exhibition will include a wide range of mediums and styles,
    producing figurative to abstract works in painting, drawing,
    sculpture, textiles, ceramics and printing, which includes etchings
    and lino productions.

ST MARGARETS BOOK GROUP SEEKS NEW MEMBERS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Long-established local book group, very friendly, seeks new
    members. Enjoying good writing and thinking is essential. Monthly
    Wednesday meetings rotate around members, with wine, nibbles,
    bookish and tangential conversations.

AUTUMN 2015 POSTNATAL YOGA FOR MUM AND BABY IN ST MARGARETS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Postnatal yoga is a perfect way to gently heal and recover body and
    mind after the birth of your baby. Yoga postures are used to regain
    strength and muscle tone, with a specific focus on the pelvic floor
    and back. Gentle breathing and relaxation techniques encourage
    stillness and calm to rejuvenate, relax and regain strength
    from within.

    Classes incorporate mum and baby, (so no need for a babysitter),
    and are a wonderful opportunity to meet other local new mums.
