<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2006/11/bulb_planting_o.html">Bulb Planting on Moormead</a></h3>

<p><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/hamptonct_ryan_flowers.html"></a></p>

<p>The community bulb planting event on Saturday 14 October at Moormead was a great success. 18 people some with their kids turned out to plant 2,000 daffodil bulbs. We had a great deal of fun and were shown a few good practice tips for digging and planting. We learnt how to dig perfectly square holes creating perfectly square clods of soil that were put back in the square holes once the bulbs had been positioned, turf still intact. The bulbs were all planted at far end of the Mead near the railway line. We are all eagerly looking forward to spring.</p>

<p>The day was run by FORCE (Friends of the River Crane Environment), who also provided tea and yummy cakes.</p>

<p>FORCE have organised a number of further volunteer days, the next is on 12th November at Craneford Fields. The day is followed by the annual barbeque, everyone who has done any work with FORCE is invited. Full details of the work done and future events can be found on the website <a href="http://www.force.org.uk/">www.force.org.uk</a>.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2006/11/philip_hodges_s.html">Haweli Seeks Planning Approval</a></h3>

<p><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/philiphodges.html"></a></p>

<p>Haweli of St Margarets, an Indian takeaway restaurant at 122 St Margarets Road has applied for planning approval to replace their existing timber shop front with a matte black aluminium one. </p>

<p>To review and comment on the application, you can look on the council website <a href="http://www.ukplanning.com/richmond/findCaseFile.do?appType=planning+folder&amp;appNumber=06%2F3201%2FFUL&amp;action=Search">here</a>.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2006/11/cocoon_spa_and.html">Cocoon Spa and Yummy Mummy Voucher Clarification</a></h3>

<p>Cocoon has written to clarify the issue of Yummy Mummy vouchers raised in our article, <a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2006/10/high_street_in.html">High Street Transformation</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Dear Editor<br />
 <br /><br /><br />
I note there is some confusion on the vouchers issue re:Yummy Mummy and Cocoon.  We understand from the previous owner Kerrie Dorman that she did sell a significant number of vouchers this year which still remain valid.  It is clear that as part of the sale of the business and associated liabilities Ms Dorman is fully expecting Cocoon Spa to honour all the vouchers.  For our part we feel that it is only fair to honour any vouchers redeemed after the closure of the business on Friday August 4th this year and so we have accounted for this in the context of taking on ongoing liabilities of Yummy Mummy.  It is important to stress that following the start up of Cocoon Spa we will only honour Yummy Mummy vouchers which have an expiry date post 4th August.<br /><br /><br />
 <br /><br /><br />
In terms of anyone who does hold vouchers and is unclear of the situation please call Jane Franks at Cocoon Spa on 0208 891 0287.</p></blockquote>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2006/10/tesco_traffic_b.html">Tesco Traffic Blocks Ambulance</a></h3>

<p>At around 11.27 yesterday, I saw one of the worst examples of loading related issues to date</p>

<p>There was one Tesco lorry in the loading bay, and another parked outside Around the World, on the corner of Bridge Road</p>

<p>In front of Oddbins, there was a lorry unloading- On the corner of St Margarets Road, at Broadway Avenue, a large 4&#215;4 was parked on the double yellow lines.</p>

<p>An ambulance was trying to get up St Margarets Road, towards Richmond - Because all of the usual passing spots were taken up with lorries and illegally parked cars, there was no way that the ambulance could get through the two lines of traffic.</p>

<p>In the end, an H37 drove up onto the pavement at the foot of the railway bridge to make enough room for the ambulance to get past - But by that time vital minutes had passed.</p>
