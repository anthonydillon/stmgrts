<p><em>8 January 2009</em></p>

<p>Welcome to the St Margarets Community Website Newsletter (<a href="https://stmargarets.london">stmargarets.london</a>). Occasional Thursdays we will send you the latest news and events from the website.</p>


<h2>Latest News</h2>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2009/01/looking_for_a_venue_how_about_a_good_place_for_a_g.html">Looking for a Venue? How About a Good Place for a Good Time?</a></h3>

<p>Eel Pie Island in Twickenham first earned its reputation as a good place for a good time back in the 15<sup>th</sup> century. Henry <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">VIII </span></span></span>used to visit to enjoy Mrs Mayo&#8217;s famous pies and in its time the Ait has been home to a bowling alley, a pub, a nature reserve and a hotel with its own jazz club that in the 1960&#8217;s helped launch bands like the Rolling Stones, the Who and the Yardbirds. When the hotel burnt down in 1971 Eel Pie Island fell off the &#8220;Must Visit&#8221; list and slowly slipped into suburban slumber.</p>

<p>Those days are now over. Eel Pie Island is open once again for fun and recreation.</p>

<p>Tucked away in a quiet corner Richmond Yacht Club is one of Eel Pie&#8217;s best-kept secrets &#8212; a small and massively friendly clubhouse and hall overlooking the river. With a stage, complete with a sound system, its own bar and well-equipped kitchen Richmond Yacht Club is a perfect venue for parties, dinners, wedding receptions and special celebrations &#8230;and with its own landing stage, you can even arrive by boat.</p>

<p>If you would like to find out more about hiring this unique and rather magical place - please contact Phillip Chart on 01932 231391 or <a href="mailto:%70%68%69%6C%6C%69%70%63%68%61%72%74%40%68%6F%74%6D%61%69%6C%2E%63%6F%6D">phillipchart@hotmail.com</a></p>

<p><img src="https://stmargarets.london/images/directory/200602010743_2x2_Opera.gif" alt=""  align="right"  /></p>

<p><a href="https://stmargarets.london/directory/music/200602010743">2&#215;2 Opera</a> is a small community opera group based in St Margarets specialising in adapting and presenting opera performed by &#8212; and for &#8212; young people.  This year we are presenting Offenbach&#8217;s comic musical theatre, Robinson Crusoe and are delighted to be performing in the new theatre at the Musical Museum in Brentford on 26, 27 and 28 March 2009.  This will be our sixth production and we will be conducted and trained by Greg Beardsell, Associate Conductor of the National Youth Choir, and Dominic Peckham, also from <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">NYC.</span></span></span></p>

<p>We are holding open auditions on Saturday 10<sup>th</sup> January for four solo roles to support the three professional singers and there are also places available in the chorus of Pirates and Cannibals.  This is a great opportunity for young people to take part in a professionally led production and have a lot of fun at the same time.  The solo roles are suitable for teenagers aged approximately 15 years and over, although one part may be more suitable for an older mezzo soprano.  The chorus parts however, are suitable for any age and we particularly welcome men and boys with broken voices. There are also opportunities to help behind the scenes.  Just come along to St Stephens&#8217; School Hall on Saturday 10<sup>th</sup> January to find out more.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2009/01/council_plans_coversion_of_orleans_infant_and_st_s.html">Council Plans Coversion of Orleans Infant and St Stephens Schools</a></h3>

<p>The Council has announced plans to provide an additional 150 permanent reception class places in borough schools, in order to meet forecast demand. The plans include the conversions of Orleans Infant and St Stephens Church of England Junior into two-form entry primary schools, subject to the final agreement of all governing bodies concerned. The Council is consulting on these plans with schools, neighbouring local authorities, and residents. If the plans are implemented, the extra places will be provided from September 2011.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2009/01/councils_cpz_review_for_morley_road_area_east_twic.html">Council&#39;s <span class="caps">CPZ</span> Review for Morley Road area, East Twickenham</a></h3>

<p>The Council has been in receipt of comments from residents of the Morley Road area of Twickenham concerning parking and traffic conditions.</p>

<p>Morley Road is situated within the East Twickenham controlled parking zone (CPZ) (zone F) which comprises parking areas designated for use by resident permit holders, business permit holders and visitors (parking meter/voucher). Where parking areas are not designated, yellow lines (either single or double) are in place.</p>

<p>Following discussions with residents, the ward councillors and the Cabinet Member, it was decided to undertake a parking review in the area. The review, which has been undertaken by one of the Council&#8217;s consultants, set out to:</p>


<ul>
<li>Identify any locations where extra parking areas could be created to maximise the overall parking capacity in the area. This includes the continuation of parking areas across driveways of single households (where considered safe and practical to do so) to allow residents/occupiers of these properties and/or their visitors to park in front of the driveways on display of a valid parking permit.  This is in line with the Council&#8217;s policy for <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">CPZ</span></span></span>s.</li>
<li>Address road safety problems caused by parked vehicles.</li>
