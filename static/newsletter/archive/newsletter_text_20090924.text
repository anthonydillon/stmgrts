JAYNE MANSFIELD AND THE CHISWICK FLYOVER
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    There was a time when we loved our cars with a passion.
    On Saturdays we would wash them and on Sundays take them out
    for a spin. We would titivate them with fluffy dice and padded
    steering wheels. On the back seat - already trimmed in polyester
    tigerskin - we would throw a tartan travel blanket and a couple
    of lacy cushions.  We even wore special clothes to drive too. Boxy
    'car coats', leather fronted 'driving gloves' and special non-slip
    driving shoes to help with those tricky double declutching gear
    changes were de rigeur. And when we were done with all that we
    would stick our names on them - usually under the plastic sun
    shield. Such was the love of the car that some people would take
    picnics to busy lay-bys just to sit and watch them go
    streaming by.

    Road building proposals were met with genuine excitement. When
    work started on the M1 from London to Birmingham on March 24th
    1958 the locals along the route brought deckchairs and packed
    lunches to sit and watch the diggers in action. When Fortes
    inaugurated their Newport Pagnell motorway service station
    on 15th August 1960 they had to open the site two hours early
    to allow in the huge crowd of cheering sightseers that had gathered
    outside. One feature they all wanted to see was the restaurant
    on the bridge. Not only could you eat but you could also watch
    the cars go by at the same time. Oh bliss!

FLIKZ FILM NITE CONTINUES AT ORLEANS HOUSE GALLERY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Flikz is aimed at young people between 12 and 19, and is a great
    activity taking place on the last Wednesday of every month
    from 6:00 to 8.30: and the next one will take place next
    Wednesday 30th September.

    It is completely free, and there will be snacks for those
    attending. The idea is to give young people the opportunity
    to meet in a safe environment after school, and enjoy a film.
    This month's choice is:-

    BE KIND REWIND Cert 12, starring Jack Black

    The Stables Gallery will remain open until 8:30, and we are
    currently showcasing Ashley Davies: 'Without Words' A new body
    of work with urban imagery as the starting point and those
    attending FLIKZ can view this show.
