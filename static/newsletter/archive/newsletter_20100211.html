<p>Welcome to the St Margarets Community Website Newsletter (<a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk">www.stmgrts.org.uk</a>). Occasional Thursdays we will send you the latest news and events from the website.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2010/02/the_killing_of_the_bees.html">The Killing of the Bees</a></h3>

<p>About 200 years ago an agricultural expert working in Middlesex was surprised to discover how few people kept bees.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/assets/images/2010/bees_1_thumb.jpg" width="150" height="97" alt="Honey bees"  align="right" /></p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;There are no bees of any consequence kept in the county. We rarely see a hive at a farm house, and perhaps not ten cottages in the county have any. It is lamentable that these most valuable insects should be so much neglected. Cottagers might pay their rent from the produce of their bees, which require little attendance and less provision. Their whole increase, wax and honey, is very nearly net profit; and they are also supposed to be very serviceable in promoting the increase of beans, peas etc.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Although at the time scientists were beginning to appreciate the important role played by bees in the pollination of plants this report clearly shows that it was not common knowledge. Another account collected by local historian <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">G.E</span></span></span> Bate suggests that very little was known about scientific beekeeping either. In his book  &#8220;And So Make a City Here&#8221;, he relates an elderly woman&#8217;s description of the way in which bees were kept in the mid 1800&#8217;s and in particular a process called &#8220;Killing the Bees&#8221;.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2010/02/the_marathon_de_sables_7_weeks_to_go.html">The Marathon De Sables: 7 Weeks to go</a></h3>

<p>I&#8217;d firstly like to say a big thank you to all those who have kindly sponsored me to do this mad race, please if you would like to help me raise money for <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">F.R.O.D.O.</span></span></span>* then please visit my just giving site at <a href="http://justgiving.com/georgie-islip">justgiving.com/georgie-islip</a> Thank you for all your support as it will keep me going through the tough stages of the race.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t quite believe it myself but I finished the Pilgrims Challenge. (The race is 66 miles. 33 Saturday and 33 on Sunday. The race runs from Farnham to Merstham and back again on Sunday.)</p>

<p>The course was the North Downs Way and it was so muddy and hilly; my shoes will never be the same. I also convinced myself that I would come home on the Saturday night as I was missing everyone and the race was hard. James, my husband, insisted I stay to complete the event and I couldn&#8217;t come home because of all the people that are sponsoring me for the real race. I&#8217;m pleased I didn&#8217;t because the satisfaction of finishing on Sunday was brilliant. I ran Saturday with my pack on, which must have been about 5-7 kg. I ran with an energy drink, wine gums, gels, bars and raisins. All revolting! Don&#8217;t run with wine gums as you can&#8217;t chew them as you are walking up the hills and therefore you become breathless. However the food was vital to keep energy levels high.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2010/02/oyster_offpeak_fare_tip.html">Oyster Off-Peak Fare Tip</a></h3>

<p>The Oyster machines at St Margarets are supposed to charge the following fares for travel to London Waterloo:</p>


<ul>
<li>&#163;3.10 peak</li>
<li>&#163;2.30 off-peak</li>
</ul>



<p>As ever nowadays, it&#8217;s necessary to read the small-print on the Oyster website which states:</p>

<blockquote><p>You pay National Rail Oyster single fares when you use Oyster on National Rail lines that did not accept pay as you go before 2010.  These fares are cheaper than cash fares on National Rail. You pay half, or less than half, the price of a cash Anytime Return.</p>

<p><strong>Peak and off-peak fares</strong><br />
Peak Oyster single fares apply from 06:30 to 09:30 and 16:00 to 19:00 Monday to Friday (excluding public holidays). At all other times, the Off-Peak Oyster single fare applies.</p>

<p>The fare charged is determined by the time at which you touch your card on the yellow card reader at the start of your journey. For example, if you plan to catch a train that leaves after 19:00, but you touch in before 19:00, you will be charged the peak Oyster fare.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you touch-in as late as 9:29 in order to catch the 9:30 train (for which you can buy a paper off-peak ticket from the ticket office from just after 9:15, when the last peak-time train has departed), Oyster will charge you the <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">PEAK </span></span></span>fare when you touch-out at Waterloo!</p>

<p>If (as happened to me today) the 9:30 train is then cancelled and you have to then wait until 09:45, Oyster <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">STILL </span></span></span>charges the <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">PEAK </span></span></span>fare when you touch-out at Waterloo - because you touched-in <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">BEFORE</span></span></span> 09:30!</p>

<p>The only way to get an Off-Peak Oyster fare at St Margarets seems to be to wait up the top of the stairs until the reader says 9:30, then touch and run!</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2010/02/st_margarets_and_st_valentine.html">St Margarets and St Valentine</a></h3>

<p><img src="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/assets/images/2010/forgetmenot_valentine_thumb.jpg" width="300" height="202" alt="Forgetmenot Flowers"  align="right" style="padding: 2px; border: 1px solid #ccc;" /></p>

<p>This year February 14<sup>th</sup>, St Valentine&#8217;s Day falls on a Sunday, opening the prospect of a whole weekend of love and laughter.</p>

<p>St Valentine&#8217;s Day on Sunday 14<sup>th</sup> February is one of three important dates in the social calendar that tumble upon each other in close succession; we also have Mother&#8217;s Day on Sunday 14<sup>th</sup> March and Easter on Sunday 4<sup>th</sup> April.</p>

<p>But, where did St Valentine&#8217;s Day come from? And, how do we celebrate it here in St Margarets?</p>

<p>There are varying opinions as to the origin of Valentine&#8217;s Day. It is thought that, indirectly the origin of this day that celebrates love is a long and bloody war campaign raged by Emperor Claudius <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">II.</span></span></span></p>

<p>The Emperor was having great difficulty getting men to sign up for his war campaign, which he felt was because the men did not want to leave their wives and families. So, he cancelled all marriages and engagements.</p>

<p>St Valentine was a Roman priest in those days and he and another, St Marius, secretly married couples in love and for this defiance he was apprehended and martyred on February 14<sup>th</sup>, 269 <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">AD.</span></span></span> Legend says that St Valentine left a farewell note for the jailer&#8217;s daughter, who had become his friend, and signed it &#8220;From Your Valentine&#8221;.  In 496 <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">A.D.</span></span></span> Pope Gelasius set aside February 14 to honour St Valentine.</p>
