<p><em>19 October 2006</em></p>

<p>Welcome to the St Margarets Community Website Newsletter (<a href="https://stmargarets.london">stmargarets.london</a>).  Each Thursday we will send you the latest news and events from the website.</p>

<h2>Latest News</h2>



<!-- start include file /home/stmargarets/html/static/newsletter/news_story.incl --><br />
<div id="special">

<h4>No News</h4>

<p>There will be no updates to the site or newsletter next week as I am finally taking a holiday.</p>

<p>Also, if you can avoid it, please stop making little comments on the site about things like &#39;this picture is out of date&#39; or about text that obviously was pasted from a press release (e.g. &#39;genuine scam&#39; from the police).  While the site has some amazing people helping, there is only one person with a very full time job and full time life that has to do all the typing, picture taking and updating.  Occasionally I cut corners and just paste that poorly written note in, or don&#39;t run up to the high street to update a photo.</p>

<p>If on the other hand you would like to channel your inner editor/journalist/photographer and help the site, I would love you hear from you.  Please email me at <a href="mailto:%65%64%69%74%6F%72%40%73%74%6D%67%72%74%73%2E%6F%72%67%2E%75%6B">editor@stmgrts.org.uk</a>.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2006/10/high_street_in.html">High Street Transformation</a></h3>

<p>At present, there seven shops on our little high street that have just or are about to change.  Currently it looks a little depressing, but hopefully things will be a bit brighter in a few month&#8217;s time.  We should note that not all details have been confirmed, but we have been informed of all details by several reliable sources and feel comfortable to print them now.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2006/10/parcel_delivery.html">Parcel Delivery Service (PDS) Scam Warning</a></h3>

<p>A card is posted through your door from a company called <span class="caps">PDS </span>(Parcel Delivery Service) suggesting that they were unable to deliver a parcel and that you need to contact them on 0906 6611911 (a premium rate number). DO <span class="caps">NOT </span>call this number as this is a mail scam originating from Belize.</p>

<p>If you call this number and you start to hear a recorded message you will already have been billed &#163;15 for the phone call.</p>

<p>If you do receive a card with these details, then please contact Royal Mail Fraud on 0207 239 6655 or <span class="caps">ICTIS </span>(the premium rate service regulator) at <a href="http://www.icstis.org.uk">www.icstis.org.uk</a> or your local trading standards office.</p>

<p><strong>This is a genuine scam.</strong></p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2006/10/st_margarets_fa_4.html">St Margarets Fair Race Night Success</a></h3>

<p><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/smf_race_night.html"></a></p>

<p>On 6 October, the St Margarets Fair Committee held a &#8216;Race Night&#8217; event at the St Margarets Church Hall to raise money for local schools and community projects.  The night was a big success with over 100 people enjoying wine, cheese and virtual horse racing.</p>

<p>Nearly &#163;900 was raised for the Committee&#8217;s annual senior citizens Christmas dinner on 6 December.  Additionally, on 6 December the Committee will present our local schools and community groups with the money raised by this years&#8217; St Margarets Fair.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2006/10/government_cons.html">Government Consultation on Runway Alternation Postponed for a Second Time</a></h3>

<p>The Government has postponed for a second time the consultation on its controversial plans to end runway alternation in West London.  The Department has admitted that &#8216;ministers have yet to reach final decisions&#8217; on the consultation, which was originally expected in March and then scheduled for October.</p>
