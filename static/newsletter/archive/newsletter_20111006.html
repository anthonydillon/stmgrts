<p><em>6 October 2011</em></p>

<p>Welcome to the St Margarets Community Website Newsletter (<a href="https://stmargarets.london">stmargarets.london</a>). Occasional Thursdays we will send you the latest news and events from the website.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2011/10/an_extraordinary_character.html">An Extraordinary Character</a></h3>

<p><img src="https://stmargarets.london/assets/images/2011/EXTRAORDINARY_Chevalier_Billing_thumb.jpg" width="150" height="172" alt="Chevalier Billing" align="right" style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 1px;" /></p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;In the court of the evening, by particular desire of several persons of distinction, the celebrated CHEVALIERE D&#8217;EON will FENCE with a NOBLEMAN.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>On the evening of 23<sup>rd</sup> August 1793 the patrons of the Theatre Royal, Richmond were looking forward to a real treat. Included on the bill that evening was a fencing display by that acknowledged champion of the flashing blade - the Chevaliere d&#8217;Eon.  This was the same person who on June 19<sup>th</sup> that year had received the personal congratulations of the Prince of Wales and his mistress Mrs Fitzherbert after a fencing demonstration that had shown <em>&#8220;a vigour and  firmness incredible&#8221;</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://stmargarets.london/assets/images/2011/EXTRAORDINARY_dEon_Prince-of-Wales_thumb.jpg" width="150" height="83" alt="Prince of Wales and Chevaliere d'Eon" align="right" style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 1px;" /></p>

<p>Unfortunately growing celebrity and royal approval did not please everyone at the theatre that night. One reviewer commented that the event was <em>&#8220;a disgusting sight&#8230; a &iuml;&not;&#129;ne display of fencing by the Chevalier but in a dress that was scarcely decent.&#8221;</em></p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2011/10/minster_of_chance_continues.html">Minster of Chance Continues</a></h3>

<p>Good news, locally produced <em>Minister of Chance</em>, a modern, pay-as-you-go radio-play is going to continue with Episode three.</p>

<div class="letter">
Dear friends,

<p><img src="https://stmargarets.london/assets/images/2011/minister_of_chance_logo_thumb.gif" width="150" height="80" alt="Minister of Chance logo" align="right" style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 1px;" /></p>

<p>Thank you so much for making the <a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2011/05/update_the_minister_of_chance.html">Minister of Chance</a> such a phenomenal success!</p>

<p>We&#8217;re thrilled to say the series will continue &amp; we are now planning to record Episode 3 this autumn. Meanwhile, please do keep spreading the word&#8230; it&#8217;s perfect for airport delays &amp; sun-loungers!</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2011/10/heathrow_airport_to_test_mixedmode_runway_use.html">Heathrow Airport to Test &#39;Mixed-mode&#39; Runway Use</a></h3>

<p>People living under Heathrow Airport&#8217;s flight path have been sent leaflets about changes to rules that allow the use of both runways simultaneously.</p>

<p>The runways are restricted to take-off or landing and switch each afternoon, except in an emergency, to give residents respite from the noise.</p>

<p>As part of a trial starting next month the threshold for triggering the emergency system will be lowered.</p>

<p>Airport operator BAA said it would allow it to minimise disruption.</p>

<p>A BAA spokesperson said leaflets had been sent to 150,000 homes that would be affected by the trials.</p>

<p>Under the changes, dual use can be deployed when a plane faces a 10-minute wait to land or take off and if 30% of all flights are delayed by more than 15 minutes.</p>

<p>The average time delay for flights at the west London airport is currently 12 minutes.</p>

<p>The first trial finishes on 29 February while the second will run from 1 July 2012 until 30 September - coinciding with the London Olympics.</p>

<p>John Stewart, chairman of the HACAN Clearskies campaign, said it was a major concern for people living in west London.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2011/10/dreamcatcher_film_camp_24_to_28_october_2011.html">Dreamcatcher Film Camp - 24 to 28 October 2011</a></h3>

<p>After a very successful summer running Film Camps in Notting Hill, Elstree and Twickenham Film Studios, Dreamcatcher Media have announced their Mid-term break Film Camp running from 24<sup>th</sup> to 28<sup>th</sup> October. Director David O&#8217;Keeffe says;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;We had a great summer with films being made on a whole range of subjects and completed to a very high standard indeed. It was wonderful to see the children being highly creative and coming up with their own film ideas.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Some students have entered their films for film festivals with one picking up a prize at Bedford Park Festival in Chiswick early in the Summer.</p>

<p>This Mid-term break the Camp for 8 - 16 year olds will run at Cole Court, London Road, Twickenham TW1 1HD from Monday 24<sup>th</sup> to Friday 28<sup>th</sup> October. This new venue for us is minutes walk from Twickenham and St Margarets stations. It offers more space with the large house, including cafe and training rooms, set in its own beautiful grounds. Off-street parking spaces are available for pick ups and drop offs.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2011/10/_the_high_cost_of.html">Creativity is Key! Bucking Employment Trends</a></h3>

<p><img src="https://stmargarets.london/assets/images/2011/First_Bday_Cebs_thumb.jpg" width="150" height="112" alt="Emily Mascarenhas with Caterpillar, Trudi Harrison and Rachel McLean by Luke Dixon - www.lukepatrickdixon.com" align="right" style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 1px;" /></p>

<p>The high cost of childcare and commuting is forcing women to give up their jobs to avoid ending up out of pocket, according to new research.</p>

<p>The latest ONS Labour Force Survey says the number of women opting to look after their children instead of doing paid employment has risen by 32,000 nationally since last summer, with rising childcare costs being a key factor in their decision.</p>

<p>However, local, entrepreneurial parents are taking matters into their own hands and returning to work under their own terms.</p>

<p>Two examples of success are <a href="http://www.forsanityssake.com">For Sanity&#8217;s Sake</a> co-founded by Rachel McLean and Andrea Quinteo, from Twickenham; and the local franchise of <a href="http://www.caterprillarmusic.com">Caterpillar Music</a> started by Emily and Tim Mascarenhas from Teddington.</p>
