ï»¿EVENT REMINDER: ST MARGARETS FAIR - 13 JULY 2013
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    The Fair, as always is about fun and getting the whole community together, 
    as well as raising funds for local schools and some local charities. It's
    all a volunteer effort with minimal running costs and nearly every penny 
    of the profit going back into the community. This year they'll be even more
    to see and do on Moormead, complete with the usual fabulous live music 
    line up.

A GLASTONBURY DIARY - 28 JUNE 2003
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    In March 2003 a friend of mine said that his group - 'Biggles
    Wartime Band' - had been booked to play at Glastonbury and there
    was a vacant spot on the bill. Did my band want to take it? So me
    and Bob and Dominic and Graham and Steve and Roger gave it our very
    best consideration for a nanosecond and then said that we would.
    There would be no money or accommodation or groupie fringed hot
    tubs of course- but we were the Ragin' Cajuns and we were ready
    to rock!
