----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    When I was a little boy I lived in Lausanne Road in Hornsey. It is
    part of the Harringay Ladder, a grid of Victorian streets running
    east -west between Wightman Road and Green Lanes. In my time, just
    after the 2nd World War, the streets were empty of cars and apart
    from the occasional milk float clip-clopping its way down the road
