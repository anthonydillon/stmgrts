SEVENTY YEARS AGO...
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    We all knew the end was coming. The signs were there for everyone
    to see. On Saturday April 28th 1945 the 'Richmond and Twickenham
    Times' reported that British POW's were beginning to trickle home
    and advised mothers and wives to take care feeding them. "Small
    meals at frequent intervals" was the recommendation. The blackout
    had already been lifted and the 'Richmond Herald' noted that "many
    and varied are the uses waiting black-out curtains now that they
    are no longer needed." It suggested turning them into pinafores
    for the children of France. Richmond Park, closed during the war,
    had been reopened to the public with this caution... "Pedestrians
    are warned that there are some mines in the boundary fence
    of Pembroke Lodge and the cottage which it has been impracticable
    to remove."

LOCAL PLAYWRIGHT LOOKING FOR YOUR STORY
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Local playwright and performance maker Annie Siddons is making a
    new show exploring connection, conformity and what is hidden
    beneath the surface in suburbia. To this end she would love to hear
    from anyone living in St Margarets who feels they don't fit the
    norms -- whether they are part of a subculture, have a different
    lifestyle, or feel like an outsider for any reason. Your
    participation level can be up to you -- you might just want a
    totally confidential chat, which would be respected, but you might
    want your story to be made public, which is cool too. Nothing is
    too outlandish or outrageous. I am not shockable.

    The project will be taking place over the next 6 months to a year
    and has the potential to become longer term.

    In the first instance, drop Annie a line
    on anniesiddons@blueyonder.co.uk and use the subject 'SUBURBIA'.

LOOKING FOR A LOCAL BOOK CLUB?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    St Margarets' Book Club, meets every third Thursday of the month
    at the Turks Head. Our members are of all ages and backgrounds.

    If you love books with a passion and like the idea of reading
    something you wouldn't normally go for (our choices are wide
    ranging but always a bit more than a holiday read) we would love
    you to join us.

RICHMOND COUNCIL'S ALL IN ONE MAY 2015 EVENTS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Your Vision, Your St Margarets, Your East Twickenham

    At the end of 2010 Richmond Council sent every household the All
    in One survey, which asked about the priorities of residents in
    each local area. We asked what people liked about where they lived
    and what could be improved.

    As a result of resident feedback, the Council has already made a
    number of changes in St Margarets and East Twickenham.
    Improvements include:

BUSINESS START-UP SURVEY
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    St Margarets is a hive of entrepreneurial activitynad Richmond Upon
    Thames has one of the highest levels of self-employment anywhere
    in the country. Richmond Council wants to help that those thinking
    of starting a business, or those in the early stages of starting
    up, to access the right support to give the best chance of success.
    To do this, the Council and support providers need to know more
    about the challenges and needs of new or emerging businesses.

    You can help to inform future support provision and help other
    start-ups by contributing your thoughts in a very short survey.
