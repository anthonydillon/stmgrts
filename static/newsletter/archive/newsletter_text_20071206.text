CPZ UPDATE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    I hope all of you who are concerned about the spread of CPZ in
    St Margaret's read this so you know what is happening currently. 
    I was informed the night two nights ago that the council would be
    holding an unpublicised meeting on 4 December, 7PM, Winchester 
    Hall, St Margarets at which the street and signage design of a 
    "trial consultation" in a newly proposed CPZ in St Margarets
    would be decided by "invited" residents.
    
    As you may know, last summer the council sent a questionnaire 
    to all of the households in the originally proposed CPZ 
    in St Margarets.  65% of household voted against the CPZ and
    36.8% said they wanted it.
    
    Nonetheless, Councillor Trigg unilaterally (without any 
    consultation with residents) decided that the original zone 
    would be subdivided forming a new zone which would include
    a large proportion of streets that had voted for CPZ, but also 
    embedded in that new zone would be streets that had voted 
    resoundingly against it.  And, that this newly proposed zone 
    would be the subject of a trial CPZ consultation.  There was 
    no formal communication regarding this decision to anyone 
    residing either in the new zone or to the remaining households
    who formed the rest of the originally proposed zone.

CHES'S TRATTORIA PASTA & PIZZA OPENS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ches's Cafe is to become Ches's Trattoria Pasta & Pizza as
    of Monday 3rd December. A new dining area downstairs from Ches's 
    Cafe has been created almost single handedly by owner Tony over
    the last year. The restaurant features include a genuine 
    traditional wood burning Pizza Oven made in Italy and installed 
    by Romans, with modern decor throughout and a summer conservatory
    which is sure to be a big hit with Pizza connoisseurs. Opening 
    hours will be 6-10.30 Monday to Saturday and the premises are 
    currently unlicensed so please bring a bottle or two of Peroni.
    
    Please support this new and exciting local project which will 
    provide the good folk of St Margarets with another exciting 
    gastronomic experience.

THE SCHOOL ON SHUHADA STREET
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    This is the fourth dispatch from Gill Swain, a local writer who 
    has traveled to Palestine to work for peace with the World Council
    of Churches.
    
    Our team's main task as Ecumenical Accompaniers in Hebron is 
    to watch over Palestinian children as they go to and from Cordoba 
    school on Shuhada Street. Every morning at 7.15 two of us stand 
    at the bottom of a steep flight of stone steps which leads up a 
    slope to the school.
    
    Directly opposite there is the settlement of Beit Hadassah, home
    to 30 or so Israeli families, an infant school and a museum. And 
    almost every morning we arrive to find a car belonging to one
    of the settlers parked as close as it is possible to get to the 
    bottom of the steps, forcing the Palestinian children to squeeze 
    past it one at a time.
    
    This is just a mean and petty gesture compared to the stone 
    throwing, spitting and screams of abuse which the children often
    suffered from the settlers over the years but it is a little bit
    of daily harassment nonetheless.
