LATEST NEWS
===========================================================



SCHOOL UPDATE & MEETING - 6 OCTOBER 2009
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Many of you will be aware that the issues around converting
    Orleans and St Stephen's schools to 2 form entry are hotting up.

    There is a meeting next week on the future of the schools that
    I am chairing. Helen Henderson will present the current situation.
    Liz Stubbs, Head of St Stephens and Nick Jones, the Chair
    of Governors will answer questions. The Head and Chair
    of Governors of Orleans Infants will also be present as will
    Steve White, Head of Buildings Projects from the Diocese.

    The Council and Vince Cable are well aware of the strength
    of feeling in this community and have been invited to attend.
    Yes, it's getting serious.

    Please come along on Tuesday 6th October at 8pm to the
    Winchester Hall. If you don't come and show your support, the
    Council will not listen. It's that simple.

    While it seems there is enough money in the pot to convert
    Orleans, and make it a top class school for St Margarets, the
    same cannot be said for St Stephen's.

    So, come along on Tuesday, 6 October to hear the facts and
    have your say.

WARNING TO RESIDENTS - BOGUS CHARITY STRIKES AGAIN
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Recently leaflets have been posted by an alleged charity
    collecting for third world countries.  They will be collecting
    tomorrow Saturday 3 October.  The name of the charity is W&W Help
    limited with the company number 6296698.  According to the
    companies house website the company was dissolved in March
    of this year.  I found this article in The Northern Echo warning
    Darlington residents.

    If you want to know more about the impact these companies have
    on legitimate charities check out a previous piece I wrote
    for the website --  Beware Bogus 'Charities' and Third
    World Appeals

    Please please do not encourage these companies by leaving bags
    out for them.

66 CROWN ROAD UPDATE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    In August, LBRUT refused an application for planning permission
    to convert 66 Crown Road into a hostel - essentially 8 bed sits.
    The refusal was welcomed by the many local residents who opposed
    the scheme.

    Conversion work at 66 Crown Road has now recommenced, however.

    For two weeks builders have been renovating the interior of the
    property and installing furniture. This morning, builders confirmed
    that their task is to complete the conversion of the house
    into bedsits as soon as possible.

    The property's owner - Mr. Robert Massie -  intends to appeal the
    decision to refuse planning permission.He must do so within six
    months of the date of refusal (10 Aug 2009).

    Although continued conversion alone represents no breach
    of planning law, occupancy of any of the bed sits prior to a
    successful appeal hearing does contravene the Council's ruling.

    Today a number of local residents have informed the Council's
    Planning department of Mr. Massie's continued attempts to convert
    the property. An LBRUT Enforcement Officer stated to me that he
    would be contacting Mr. Massie to establish his intentions and
    advise him against undertaking any steps which would lead to a
    breach of the Council's authority. The Enforcement Officer
    commented that the Council possess a number of powers to
    enforce its decision - including a temporary stop notice and
    eviction order.
