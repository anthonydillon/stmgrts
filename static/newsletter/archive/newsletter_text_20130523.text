ï»¿FIRE STARTER!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    In the early hours of Friday, 28th May 1943, All Saints Church,
    standing by the Thames in Old Isleworth, was destroyed by fire. The
    alarm was given at 2.30am by Miss Burrage who lived next door and
    again by Mr. McDonald, the publican of the "London Apprentice".
    Against the darkness of the wartime black-out the glow of the huge
    fire could be seen for miles.

    Very little of the church remained after the blaze. Altar, chancel,
    organ, stained glass windows, hymnals, all had gone. Only the old
    church tower, built about 1399, survived along with its bells.
    Stand in the church tower today and look up and you can still see
    the charred timbers underneath the bell chamber.

YOUR VITAL VOICE - LESSONS FROM SURYA
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Surya Cooper Tells Us Why Singing is So Good for You

    Vital Voices is about a new way of learning to sing, taking your
    voice in a new musical direction; it's not something you may have
    experienced before, or seen on TV. It's not Glee, nor a church
    choir or a community sing-song but a way to give 'Voice' to the
    music inside you, and share it with others in a relaxed setting. We
    not only sing part-songs but also work on developing range and
    tone. We learn to improvise and harmonise, playing with and
    learning how to care for our voices. Our group also uses percussion
    to enhance our musicality.

DREAMCATCHER MEDIA'S FILM CAMP - SUMMER 2013
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Make a 5 minute film in 5 Days and take a copy home on DVD!

    Here at Dreamcatcher Media, the films made on our Summer Film Camps
    feature great heroes and anti-heroes, goodies and baddies, exciting
    chases and dramatic scenes - all scripted, filmed and directed
    by young people aged 8 - 16.

    Our next 5 day Film Camp starts on 8th July. Children come up
    with their own idea for a film, then set about shooting, directing
    and editing it over the five days under expert tuition from
    industry professionals. It's all great fun but good learning too
    and young wannabee filmmakers finish the course equipped to make
    their own movies.

    Sponsored by the Alpha Plus Group, the Camp takes place at Falcons
    Boys Prep School in Richmond and runs weekly from July 8th
    until August 30th starting at 9am. See website
    www.dreamcatchermedia.co.uk for other locations.

    To Book, Call - 0208 8916414 or email info@dreamcatchermedia.co.uk.
