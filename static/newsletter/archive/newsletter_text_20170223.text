PIG SNOUT AND THE ISLEWORTH MAYPOLE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    In 1682 George married the beautiful Sophia Dorothea of Celle but
    it wasn't the happiest of marriages. The trouble started before
    they had even met. When Sophia first heard that she was to marry
    George she shouted "I will not marry that pig snout!" and threw a
    miniature of him against the wall. Things didn't improve when they
    did finally get together. She fainted. She fainted again on meeting
    her future mother-in-law.
