<p>The thing about ghosts is that they are unpredictable. They turn up when you least expect them and then they scare the living daylights out of you. That's how they work. You cannot set your watch by a ghost because ghosts do not keep to schedules or time tables... apart from the ghost of Queen Elizabeth 1<sup>st</sup> which is supposed to make an annual appearance every March 24<sup>th</sup> in the courtyard of Richmond Palace.</p>

<p>It's ironic that a new mum takes on her most challenging physical role when she is potentially the most out of physical alignment. Lifting and carrying a baby can be a struggle if your ligaments are unstable and this in turn makes your spine vulnerable to injury. Even if you have a normal, low risk pregnancy, the right exercise plays a vital role in keeping you strong and healthy.</p>

<p>Residents are hoping to transform the Northcote Avenue Recreation Ground, known locally as the 'Pit Park', into a landscaped area and nature reserve. Although just within the borough of Hounslow, the park faces Richmond across the River Crane, the middle of which marks the borough boundary. For this reason it has always been used by residents of North St Margarets as well as their Hounslow neighbours, being for many their nearest open space.</p>
