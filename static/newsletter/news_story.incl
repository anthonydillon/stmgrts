I met Chuck Berry once. It was early one morning in a deserted terminal building at Heathrow.  Like me he was probably waiting to catch the first plane out to somewhere. He was sitting on a bench wrapped up in a greatcoat, with a guitar case at his side and a sour look on his face. It was him alright. He had been a hero of mine for years and was unmistakeable.

Although Francis 'Black' Jack Needham, 2<sup>nd</sup> Earl of Kilmorey and his oh-so-much younger mistress Priscilla Anne have both been dead for over 130 years they are proving to be St Margarets most welcoming hosts. Once again the stylish Victorian mausoleum that they share on the St Margarets Road opposite the Ailsa Tavern will be opening to the public.
