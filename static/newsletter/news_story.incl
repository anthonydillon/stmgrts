<p>Here is a photograph taken in 1954 of Elvis Presley, aged 19. This was long before <em>'college boy hair cut'</em> post-military service Elvis, star of some mind numbing films like <em>'Paradise Hawaiian Style'</em>, the weird <em>'Harum Scarum'</em> and the even more grisly <em>'Clambake'</em>... and even longer before lardy Las Vegas, pilled up Elvis, of spangled jump suit fame, handing out souvenir scarves at the International Hotel.</p>

<p>There had been a lot of misleading talk before the Battle of the Somme. Because of the heavy artillery barrage that had been <em>'softening-up'</em> the German lines for the last seven days military command thought that the opening attack, scheduled for 1<sup>st</sup> July 1916, would be &#8211; literally &#8211; a <em>'walk-over'</em>. General Sir Henry Rawlinson said to his subordinates, <em>"Nothing could exist at the conclusion of the bombardment in the area covered by it"</em>.</p>
