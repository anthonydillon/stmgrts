<p>There are some people who believe that our planet is interlaced with an invisible matrix of magnetic &#8211; and perhaps magical &#8211; lines of energy. In China they are called  <em>'Dragon Paths'</em>, in Ireland  <em>'fairy paths'</em>.  In Peru they are  <em>'Spirit Lines'</em> and in Australia  <em>'Song Paths'</em>. In Germany they are  <em>'Heilige Linien'</em> and in Britain they are  <em>'Ley Lines'</em>, a name conjured up in 1921 by amateur archaeologist Alfred Watkins.</p>
