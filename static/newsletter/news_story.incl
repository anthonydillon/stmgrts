<p>Before we get too excited about the future and <em>'squadrons of automatons zipping about'</em> we should not forget that the concept of robots, replicants and androids has been around for centuries. One of the great Cretan myths about Talos, the mechanical man who guarded the island from pirates, dates back to 400 years BC. An automaton with a similar defensive purpose was created in Czechoslovakia in the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>After many years of service, Adam Tocock is stepping down from his role with the St Margarets Traders Association.  Adam helped organise the group and all their activities, including publishing the wonderful St Margarets magazines and running the semi-annual Crown Road fairs.  It is hard and often unappreciated work, but Adam pushed forward with a smile on his face and a ready joke.  Thank you Adam and we will see you at Cutters.</p>
