<p>On Richmond Hill there lives a lass<br />
More bright than May-day morn,<br />
Whose charms all others maids' surpass,<br />
A rose without a thorn.<br />
This lass so neat,<br />
With smiles so sweet,<br />
Has won my right good will.<br />
I'd crowns resign<br />
To call thee mine,<br />
Sweet lass of Richmond Hill!</p>
