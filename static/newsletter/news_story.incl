<p>80 years ago you could have seen the 38 metre river barge <em>'Cathja'</em> working on the canals and inland waterways of Belgium and Holland. Today she rests in a quiet inlet of the Thames in Isleworth, in the shadow of a long redundant loading crane. Cathja's days of cargo lighterage are over. In the cargo hold that once carried scrap iron, coffee beans, grain and fertiliser you'll now find woodworking benches, tools and all the machinery that you might expect in a well equipped carpentry shop. On the steel walls and bulkheads where once hung loading ropes and cables now there are paintings, canvases, artwork and brushes. Today the <em>'Cathja'</em> has a new purpose. Today the <em>'Cathja'</em> has a new crew.</p>

<p>I consider myself "Euro Cautious". I am not a strong enthusiast for the European Union &#8211; it has become too bureaucratic, too controlling and too expensive &#8211; but I am by no means blind to the benefits it brings either.</p>
<p>On this basis, I have always said that I wanted to be able to vote to stay in the EU and following the announcement that the referendum will now be held on 23<sup>rd</sup> June, I now know that I will be voting for the UK to remain a member of the European Union.</p>
