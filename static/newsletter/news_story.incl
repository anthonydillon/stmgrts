    <p>Anyone who has gone wandering up the River Crane in wellies knows that there is often more than hungry ducks and plastic bottles coming down on the tide. After centuries of carving its way through Tudor middens, Georgian gunpowder mills, Victorian rubbish dumps and wartime back gardens the Crane can offer many surprises to the keen-eyed mudlark. from porcelain pot tops and tin hats to cast iron pokers and earthenware bottles saying <em>'Richmond Bottling'</em>.</p>

    <p>An enhanced, interactive nature trail will be laid on Crane Park Island Nature Reserve following a &pound;4,228 grant from the Council's Community Fund.</p>

<p>London Wildlife Trust is working to improve the island's nature trail by installing numbered oak posts which link to an information map. The posts will have interactive tactile panels which children can use to make rubbings from which will tell them about the history and wildlife of the area.</p>
