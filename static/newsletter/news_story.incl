<p>You may well have driven past the place, sitting behind its brick wall. You may have noticed the fencing and the <em>'Home Office Property'</em> signs. You may well have wondered what this large, well proportioned house sitting in a quiet, wooded corner in Ham was all about.  The former home of some Victorian well-to-do? A sanatorium? A top secret MI5 interrogation cage? A remand centre? Guess any of these options and you would have guessed right.</p>
