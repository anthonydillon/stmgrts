Last week I received a phone call from <em>'John Martin from Manchester'</em> who sounded more like Mukesh from Mumbai. He said that his company, <em>'Claims Advisory Group'</em>, had been commissioned by the Government to find people who had paid excessive Bank Charges. If this proved to be the case <em>'Claims Advisory Group'</em> would pursue a claim and compensation. In my case the cash-back would be somewhere between &pound;3,000 and &pound;5,000.
