In the spring of 1967 an unusual package tour flew into Europe from America. Unlike other pop shows on the circuit at the time these artists were mainly black, they all came from Memphis, Tennessee and they all recorded for the same record label, Stax, known locally as "an R&B powerhouse".

Crane, yes. But tidal Crane? You could be forgiven for not knowing that the river we glimpse at Moormead and alongside the Cole Park Allotments is tidal in its final stretch from (roughly) the Northcote Road footbridge to the Thames.

    Residents are being asked to help change the future of loneliness and isolation in the borough and consider volunteering to be a friend to an older resident who is alone.
