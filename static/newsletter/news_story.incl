On Monday 8<sup>th</sup> July 1985 a production of Tennessee Williams's play  <em>"Sweet Bird of Youth"</em>, directed by Harold Pinter, opened at the Haymarket Theatre in London's West End. The star of the show was the sultry Hollywood star Lauren Bacall, the widow of Humphrey Bogart. It was an appropriate piece of casting. <em>"Sweet Bird of Youth"</em> written in 1959 tells of a fading movie star, Alexandria Del Lago, and her relationship with gigolo and drifter Chance Wayne. One commentator said that the part was written for Bacall, although Tennessee Williams had originally conceived it for Tallulah Bankhead.

Councils opposed to expansion at Heathrow have told the Transport Select Committee that the most recent evidence published by the Government continues to demonstrate that a third runway could not be built at the airport without causing unacceptable air and noise pollution.

A Planning Application to redevelop Twickenham Riverside has been submitted and will be open to statutory consultation.

Over the past two years the Council has been consulting with residents and businesses in Twickenham on proposals for a new development on King Street / Water Lane and Twickenham Riverside.  The development site includes three properties on the corner of King Street and Water Lane, the car park to the rear and the derelict former swimming pool buildings.

On Sunday 3rd December, local residents planted eight trees to mark the inauguration of the new Northcote Nature Reserve in Isleworth.

The Nature Reserve is the northernmost point of the recently announced Lower Crane Restoration Project, which aims to restore 3m of riverside paths and create a more natural river along the adjacent river Crane.

A 20mph speed limit could be introduced across the borough it was announced at last week's Council meeting.

The plans were announced by Cllr Peter Buckwell, Richmond Council Cabinet Member for Highways, following a rise in the number of community petitions being submitted to the Council, requesting 20mph.
