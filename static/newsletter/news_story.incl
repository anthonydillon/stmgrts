<p>With shops and supermarkets already brimming over with Christmas merchandise I think that we can safely assume that the Christmas season has started. The John Lewis yuletide TV Ad probably confirm it. But before you rush off to deck your halls with boughs of holly, <em>tra la la la la etc etc...</em> you might consider what folk-lore has to say on the matter.</p>

<p>Richmond Council has started round three of the consultation on its plans to update the Twickenham Riverside.  The first two rounds have not been very successful to say the least.  This time there are three proposals to look at, all from the same architect.  There is a pop-up on Church Street to see the plans and comment.  You can also <a href="http://www.richmond.gov.uk/twickenham_rediscovered_have_your_say">look online</a>, but turning up is the better way to see and have your views heard.</p>

<p>The folks at Twickenham Alive have started a new, online newspaper.  A bit of an odd format for this day and age, but why not?  Billed as 'a new local newspaper for Twickenham&quot;, the first edition is full of interesting articles and they have a lot of contributors.</p>
