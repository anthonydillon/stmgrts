<p>Most times coincidences feel like an unexpected serendipity that has been wafted along by a gentle breeze. Sometimes they feel like a cudgel beating you over the head. Once is interesting, twice is uncanny, three times are unsettling. When it comes to four times -- watch out for that cudgel!</p>

<p>Once upon a time a Prince made Orleans House his home; he loved books and built a library where he could house his large collection and read in peace. When he left Orleans House for France he took his prized books with him, years later his library was demolished by gravel merchants. Today, the woodland has grown and covered where the library once stood.</p>
