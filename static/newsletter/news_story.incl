In other places it might be called "A Yard Sale" or "A Garage Sale" or even "A Car Boot Sale" but not in North St Margarets. There is a 'Sale' coming all right but you won't find a Car or a Boot, or a Garage or a Yard for that matter. In North St Margarets their street sale is called "G.A.S.S Day" which fans of acronyms might recognise as "Great Annual Street Sale". Acronym fans will also recognise that it is run by NSMRA - the North St Margarets Residents Association - and like all good street sales it takes place in the street.
