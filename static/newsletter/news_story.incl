Through their Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre the Ministry of Defence supports a continuing service recovering  <em>'missing'</em> British and Commonwealth service personnel killed in conflict from the 1<sup>st</sup> World War right up to the Korean War in the 1950's... and it is this small team of six dedicated people who are providing Uncle Eric with the formal military funeral that he never received in 1917.

    Faced with massive cuts in Government funding, Richmond Council will be raising Council Tax to protect the key services that residents want and need.

Historically, under successive Governments, Richmond upon Thames has been poorly funded. The four year Finance Settlement arranged in 2016 has resulted in Richmond losing its Government General Grant by 2018/19. This continues to leave Richmond as the lowest funded Council in London with the Council Tax paid by residents covering an ever higher share of service costs.

A museum dedicated to the rich musical- and river-related history of Eel Pie Island, Twickenham has opened its doors at 1-3 Richmond Road in Twickenham.

Following a successful crowdfunding campaign, match-funded by the Mayor of London, and with the sponsorship of local businesses and organisations, and the support of Richmond Council, the Museum now enjoys a permanent location in the heart of Twickenham.

Elm Walk will be a new avenue of trees along the path from Petersham Gate. The start of the Elm Walk will be marked with an elm tree presented by the Friends to Sir David Attenborough on his 90<sup>th</sup> birthday.
