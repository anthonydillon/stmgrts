Running the classes locally since 2008 and booking new students in East Twickenham and Twickenham.

In every session my aim is to teach a safe, effective and beneficial set of exercises that work for everyone in the group, modifying exercises to suit, if a person has a shoulder problem I will simplify the move until they are ready to move on. After each class I want you to feel you have worked your whole body but feel relaxed and stretched.
