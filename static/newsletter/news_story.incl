We are surrounded by people who are responsible, people we can rely on. They help hold together our communities and our society. Responsible people. People who are <em>"morally accountable for their actions"</em>. Not just the obvious ones like doctors and nurses and teachers and ministers of religion, people who according to the dictionary are  <em>"capable of rational conduct, of good credit or position or repute, respectable, apparently trustworthy"</em>.
