To head up the project they brought in Jack Good, a young pioneering producer with a hot idea.  Why not make it a 100% rock <em>'n'</em> roll show with non-stop music, lots of movement, teenage stars, some hip presenters and an audience of young, trendy boppers? Sound good? Mmmmm... Not for the BBC!</p>
