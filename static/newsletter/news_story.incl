'Nark Drool and the Shudders' had played many times on Eel Pie Island and felt quite privileged to be following in the steps of the Rolling Stones, the Yardbirds, Rod Stewart and the other R&B greats of the 1960s. But after a few years of dragging our equipment across the humped back bridge on trolleys and back again in the early hours of the morning, trailing behind us the ghosts of Brian Jones, Keith Relf, Ken Colyer, Keith Moon and all the others that had moved on to the great gig in the sky we thought that enough was enough. Then Trevor Baylis, the man who invented the wind-up radio, phoned us up.

Richmond upon Thames' residents and businesses are being encouraged to pass on using plastics to help preserve the borough's beautiful environment.

Every year in London we use 2.3 tonnes of plastic packaging, 13 billion plastic bottles, and 2.5 billion coffee cups. Meanwhile, a staggering 1 million plastic straws are used every day. This has to change.

A fleet of self-driving robots will be trialled across the borough - aimed at reducing carbon emissions and delivery costs.

Richmond Council has agreed that Starship Technologies can pilot their latest innovation, a self-driving delivery robot, on the borough's highway network.

    Council leaders have called on the Transport Secretary to say how many years of extra noise he expects local communities to suffer if a third Heathrow runway is built.

The Government has so far refused to release updated noise assessments for the four years following the new runway's expected opening in 2026. These were prepared for the revised draft National Planning Statement (NPS) but not included as part of the October 2017 consultation.

A pilot to bring dockless bike share to Richmond upon Thames will launch in April.

Advancements in technology means bicycle hire schemes no longer require docking stations, as provided with the current Santander London cycle hire scheme, with the technology now built directly into the bikes themselves.
