Do you have any old photographs, memorabilia or documents relating to Marble Hill Park?  Bring them along to our collection event. Weâ€™ll take photographs of your contributions and record the story behind them before handing them straight back to you. In this way we hope to build up a social history of the park since the early 1900s, when it came into public use.
