The Battle of North Cape began Christmas Day 1943 when the German battlecruiser Scharnhorst and five escorting destroyers left their base in Altenfjord to intercept two Arctic Convoys rounding Norway's North Cape. Convoy JW55B was transporting essential supplies to the Soviet Union, and RA 55A was returning to the U.K.

Richmond Council is encouraging residents not to attack any nests. Normally bumblebee nests live for around 2-3 months, they do not cause any structural damage and they do not swarm. They are also not aggressive insects and are generally only interested in finding flowers. The only time when they may act defensively is if something disturbs their nest.
