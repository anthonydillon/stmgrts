<p>Although I have reached an age when I am expected &#8211; and sometimes encouraged &#8211;  to be grumpy I do not consider myself to be a particularly prickly sort of man. I don't mind too much if people push in front of me at the bus stop and if others pay small fortunes for jeans with pre-torn knees, ride bicycles in the rain with no mudguards (how ridiculous is that?) and walk up the street with their noses stuck into smart phones then so be it.</p>
