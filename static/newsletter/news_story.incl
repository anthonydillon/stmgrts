Some people, local estate agents mainly, insist on calling St Margarets  <em>'the village'</em> even though most of us know that our slice of paradise is really a  <em>'dormitory'</em> or <em>'a railway town'</em> which didn't really come into existence until the railway station was opened on Monday 2<sup>nd</sup> October 1876. Before then it was about 2,000 acres of pasture, arable land, wood and common. We should be grateful that we live in <em>'St Margarets'</em>. The local businessmen who helped pay for the new station wanted to call the neighbourhood <em>'Ailsa Bridge'</em>. Phew!
