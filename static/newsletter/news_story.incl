Wood burning stoves seem to be quite the thing these days - so with Christmas rapidly approaching perhaps we should be thinking about the  <em>'Christmas or Yule Log'</em>. As Charles Lamb once had it... "Of all the enjoyments of the season the most indispensable is a large, heaped -up, all attractive fire".

    Residents who may be at risk of slipping on their driveways and footpaths are being encouraged to take advantage of the Borough's newest community initiative.

The Council will be offering residents the option to collect up to 50kg of free rock salt to assist in the clearance of footpaths and to make areas safer for their use.
