    Working in partnership to create a borough that is safer for all is at the heart of the borough's new Community Safety Strategy, which was approved by Richmond Council last week.

Richmond Community Safety Partnership brings together Richmond Council, the Metropolitan Police, probation services, London Fire Brigade, the Richmond Clinical Commission Group, schools and voluntary groups. All work together to help make the borough a safer place to live, work, learn and visit.
