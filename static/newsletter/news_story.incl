<p>On the 27th December 2015 &#8211; in the middle of those strange echoing days between Christmas and New Year &#8211; a former pop star died. There won't be any memorial tribute concerts for him and there will be few who recognise his name but he was, in part, responsible for one of the greatest pop records of the 1960's.</p>
