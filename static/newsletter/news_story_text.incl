SOME INS AND OUTS ON EELS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    "The eel is excellent, nutritious food, whereof the supply is in no
     danger of running short in the British Isles. On the contrary, the
     resources of our waters in the matter of eels is well-nigh
     inexhaustible, and it is to be regretted that they are not more
     generally developed, and that our own people do not exert
     themselves to secure some of the profit which Dutchmen derive
     from supplying the English market".
