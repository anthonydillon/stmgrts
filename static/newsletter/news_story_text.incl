RIDING THE RUSTY HUSKY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    When I was a teenager I used to deliver newspapers in the
    countryside around the village of Welham Green in Hertfordshire.
    Because the delivery round was eight miles long Fred the newsagent
    allowed me to use his car - the "Rusty Husky" - a rather tired
    Hillman Husky with holes in the floor and a hundredweight sack
    of sugar over the back axle to help with traction in muddy
    farmyards and fallen snow.
