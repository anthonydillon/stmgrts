CONSULTATION ON BOROUGH-WIDE 20MPH LIMIT GETS FAST-TRACKED
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Residents will soon be able to have their say on plans to introduce
    a borough-wide 20MPH speed limit in Richmond upon Thames.

    The new, borough-wide 20MPH speed limit would replace the existing
    policy under which 20MPH zones are implemented on a road by road
    basis following petitions from residents. The petition is then
    evaluated by officers before a formal consultation begins.
