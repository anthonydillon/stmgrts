In a previous life I worked in Children's Television. At that time I had contact with a lot of record pluggers, those young, enthusiastic and thick-skinned people whose difficult job was to promote artists that they often didn't like to unsympathetic people like me and persuade us to book them onto our programmes. As an inducement they would regale us with free tickets to see the acts playing live and as much vinyl as we could carry. One of this gallant and hard-boiled band was Ed who worked for the NEMS Agency. He knew almost everything there was to know about the pop scene although he was always very discreet about it.

Residents are being reminded that their collection times will be subject to change over the Christmas and New Year holiday period.

Following the Bank Holiday on Tuesday 26 December, Richmond Council will carry out waste and recycling collections (including Garden Waste Collections) for domestic properties two days later than usual.  For example, Monday collections will take place on Wednesday and the Tuesday collections on Thursday.

Working skilfully with our emotional landscape is one of the biggest challenges of being human.  In this modern world many of us are caught within a confusing contradiction -- pressured to work harder and harder while simultaneously living and pursuing a fuller and happier life.  It's not surprising that this can lead to a sense of overwhelm and defeat.  Our emotions, instead of being regarded as valued messengers from the heart, become assailants and barriers. Without realising it, we can easily move into a place of emotional estrangement and numbness.

Residents are invited to have their say on the development of planning guidelines for Old Deer Park in Richmond.
