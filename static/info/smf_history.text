h1=. St Margarets Fair History

It was on a Spring evening in the year of the Queen's Jubilee twenty eight years ago, over a drink at the Turks Head pub, that a group of friends had the idea of creating an event on the nearby Moormead recreation ground which would provide a grand party for the local community and at the same time raise money for various charities.

Volunteers came forward to run a coconut shy and children's games, stallholders were recruited and tents ordered to house kegs of beer, and tea and home made cakes.  The mix proved so successful that the day became an annual event.  More helpers were needed and the local schools were invited to participate at which time a five-a-side football tournament became a fixture.  The list of stallholders grew, a barbeque, Indonesian and Greek food arrived and West Middlesex Hospital Radio agreed to host music and interviews all afternoon.  A friendly fairground operator brought a helter skelter, a stage was ordered on which short plays could be performed and local bands played; the schools gave displays of dance and gymnastics.  Celebrities and the local Mayor soon joined the list of special guests to be invited.

The list of organizations to benefit from the Fair over the years is now a long one.  The policy of the present Fair Committee is to divide the year's proceeds to give half to our four local schools (Orleans Park, St Stephens, St Marys and Orleans Infants) and the other half to charities in need, a choice being made each autumn from applicants in St Margarets and the surrounding area.  In order to run the Fair we are indebted to local residents, parents from the schools, the St Margarets and Turks Head pubs, Churchills Estate Agents, the Rugby Football Union and many, many more.
