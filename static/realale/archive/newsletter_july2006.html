<p class="pink">We are happy to announce that we shall have a stall at the <span class="caps">GBBF </span>this year, please feel free to stop by and say hello!</p>

<h3><span class="caps">NEW STOCK</span></h3>

<p>The new brewery introduced this last month is the Dark Star Brewery, located just north of Brighton, West Sussex. The Dark Star Brewery prides itself on using floor malted Maris Otter barley in its ales. Using a floor malting is the old fashioned method, which micro-brewers all agree delivers the high quality malted barley. This is a well known brewer whom has only recently ventured into bottling!</p>


<ol>
<li><strong>Sunburst</strong> 4.8% &#8212; This is a light straw coloured ale, with light subtle crisp hoppy flavours, it was voted the second best ale at last months tasting. (Its Nick&#8217;s new favourite!)</li>
<li><strong>Espresso</strong>, superior coffee beer 4.2% &#8212; This ale &#8220;does what is says on the tin!&#8221; It is a black beer brewed with fully roasted barley malt and challenger hops but with freshly ground espresso coffee beans added to the copper for a few minutes after the boil to provide a complementary coffee aroma. It was voted the best ale at last months tasting!</li>
</ol>
