    Orleans Infant School will be 100 years old in 2011!  To get us in the mood, we held a _1910 School Day_ on December 3, 2010. Several children noticed how much nicer the teachers are now than 100 years ago!
    
    Plans are being formulated to celebrate the School Centenary with several events involving pupils past and present.  However, we would welcome any contribution that would increase our knowledge of the history of the school.  If you are a former pupil, or have relatives who were pupils we would love to hear any memory you may have. Should anyone wish to contact the school direct e-mail the following: "centenary@orleans.richmond.sch.uk":mailto:centenary@orleans.richmond.sch.uk
