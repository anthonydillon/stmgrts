People in Richmond are being asked for their views on the Council's draft assessment of the availability of pharmacies and medication in the borough.

These views will inform the Council's final Pharmaceutical Needs Assessment (PNA). Findings will be used to advise the NHS on what future services need to be provided by NHS pharmacies in Richmond upon Thames.

These are local high street pharmacies where residents can pick up prescriptions, purchase medication that doesn't need to be prescribed by a doctor, and access other services that promote health and wellbeing, such as, stop smoking services. It excludes pharmacies at hospitals, or where you might by beauty products.

Cllr Mark Boyle, Cabinet member for Public Health said:

bq.  "We are lucky to live in one of the healthiest areas in the country. However, it is important that residents can get the right medication and pharmacist's advice as and when they need it.

bq. "The consultation will inform the NHS's decisions on how it funds pharmacies and other drug dispensers in the borough over the coming years so it would be helpful if residents gave their feedback."
