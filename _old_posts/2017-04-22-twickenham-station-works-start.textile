If you haven't noticed, works have stated on Twickenham Station by the developer Solumn. This will effect access to the station and travel on many, many weekends over the coming year.

The result will be:

bq.  "As part of the transformation plans, a new station is being built around a brand new public plaza the size of 5 tennis courts. The station will feature lifts to the platforms, a significantly larger ticket office and additional cycle parking spaces. A pedestrian walk way to Moormead is also being created.
bq. 
The plaza will include new shops and create a modern gateway to Twickenham, as well as 115 much needed new homes."

p. If you are interested in the project and the likely disruption to travel, please sign-up for news at "www.twickenhamforward.com":http://www.twickenhamforward.com/
