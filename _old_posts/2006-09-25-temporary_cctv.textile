Last week Thursday, 21 September, a Rapid Deployment Camera (RDC) was installed in Moormead Park, overlooking the playground.  The police requested the council a few weeks ago, but the installation was detailed due to the refitting of the new lamposts.

bq. "It is only a temporary camera and will remain there for about 28 days, if an incident occurs, eg. graffiti or an assault etc. an engineer will be able to retrieve footage on ourh request. It was placed to monitor the park to assist us in getting a better picture of who's causing problems at the park. It is designed to be visible so will work as a deterrent as well."
