Space to Be will be offering an 8-Week Mindfulness Course from September 3<sup>rd</sup> - October 29<sup>th</sup> in the Emmanuel Centre, at the back of St James Catholic Church in Twickenham.

Mindfulness is a practice which involves deliberately bringing your awareness to the present moment with acceptance and non-judgement.  Research suggests that meditation and awareness training can boost the immune system, significantly reduce stress, improve sleep, bolster creativity, reduce the ruminative thinking that leads to anxiety and depression and improve relationships with loved ones and friends.

Throughout the course students will be building the muscle of awareness through a variety of formal and informal meditations.  For more details about the course please have a look on the website below.  All applications must be received by Friday, August 22<sup>nd</sup>.

Could mindfulness be your path to less stress and greater wellbeing?
