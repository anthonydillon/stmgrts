    The Conservatives made a promise of 30 hours "free" child care during the last general election.

The Conservatives made a promise of 30 hours "free" child care during the last general election. There are currently insufficient state nursery places locally (only one in four of those in the Borough are in state nurseries with the rest being provided by the voluntary sector or private sector).

Nursery places in the private sector cost at least &pound;7.50 to &pound;8 per hour but Richmond Council currently only pays &pound;3.60 per hour. This is costing parents &pound;2,000 a year for something which is supposed to be free.

Please help support my petition which calls on the Council to properly fund nursery places so that no parent or free school is left out of pocket.
