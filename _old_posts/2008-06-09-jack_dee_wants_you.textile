This is to let the residents of Richmond and the surrounding area know that Jack Dee will be filming for the new series of _Lead Balloon_ at "Richmond Theatre":https://stmargarets.london/directory/theatre/200506150229 on Sunday 22<sup>nd</sup> June.  We would like to invite locals to come along as an audience.  Entrance is free and filming should only take 2-3 hours.  If you are interested in coming along and being part of the day please get in touch at "audience@openmike.co.uk":mailto:audience@openmike.co.uk.  For those that can't make it on Sunday 22<sup>nd</sup> we are also filming in Shepherds Bush on Monday 23<sup>rd</sup> and require an audience that day also.
 
We very much look forward to hearing from anyone who is interested in coming along.
 
Many thanks.
