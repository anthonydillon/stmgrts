Richmond Council agreed a proposal to provide temporary accommodation for the popular Turing House School at its Cabinet meeting last week.

Turing House is a secondary free school run by the Russell Education Trust. It opened in September 2015 in temporary premises, at Livingston House, Queens Road, Teddington.

Its proposed permanent site in Whitton, is likely to be ready for occupation in 2020. However, it will not have room at its current location to admit a further intake in September 2018.

In order to bridge the gap so that this very popular school can continue to run, the Council agreed at a formal Cabinet meeting last Thursday (16 November) to offer the use of a nearby school site, Clarendon School, in Hanworth Road, Hampton.

The current Clarendon site will be vacated in July 2018. This is when the primary-aged pupils will move to the former Newhouse site and the new buildings for the secondary aged pupils at Clarendon, on the Richmond Education and Enterprise Campus in Twickenham, will be ready for occupation.

The Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA), whose task it is to secure sites for free schools, will make some adaptations to the Clarendon buildings to make them suitable for Turing to use.

Cllr Susan Chappell, Strategic Cabinet Member for Children's Services and Schools, added:

bq.  "I am delighted that we have been able to step in and offer this temporary accommodation for Turing House.
bq. 
bq. "I know that negotiations between the ESFA and Hounslow Council have taken longer than expected. I am sure many parents are anxious about this.
bq. 
bq. 
bq. "This interim accommodation will hopefully reassure parents, carers and children that the school will be able to keep going and growing."
