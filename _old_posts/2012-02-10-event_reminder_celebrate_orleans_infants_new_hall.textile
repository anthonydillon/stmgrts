The Orleans Infant School PTA (FOOI) has booked St Margarets favourites Fake Tan on 24<sup>th</sup> February to celebrate the opening of the new school hall. Tickets are &pound;20 and include a glass of bubbly and Indian snacks. Funds raised will be put towards a new outdoor writing classroom to accommodate thirty children - the classroom should really help to motivate the children and there is good evidence that learning outdoors in particularly effective for boys.

We look forward to seeing you.
