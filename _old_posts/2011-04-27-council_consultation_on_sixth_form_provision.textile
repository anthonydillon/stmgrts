In December 2010, the Council decided to see whether it would be possible to set up viable sixth form provision in the eight secondary schools and academies within the borough (by 'viable', we mean that the provision would be sustained by sufficient student numbers to ensure that a broad and attractive curriculum could be offered).

As part of that work, we would like to know your views on whether or not establishing sixth forms would be a good idea, and how they would have influenced your educational choices if they had already been established.

Your views are important to us and will be taken into account when the resulting report is considered.
