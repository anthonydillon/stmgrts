"Richmond Furniture Scheme":https://stmargarets.london/directory/charity/200703111434 will be open on Saturday 5<sup>th</sup> February 2011 from 10 to 12 noon.

This is to enable people who are at work during the week days to come and visit the scheme. Our usual opening hours are 1000 to 1500 Mondays to Thursdays.

We have good second-hand quality furniture for sale.

Our main customer base are people on benefits. However, to help raise necessary funds for the scheme and to ensure that surplus furniture is sold, we open up to the general public.
