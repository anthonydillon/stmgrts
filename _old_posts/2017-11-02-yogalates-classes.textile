Beat those winter blues every Sunday night at the ETNA Centre with two brand new Yoga classes!

Yogalates at 6pm combines the best of hatha yoga and pilates; toning and strengthening, building core stability, flexibility and balance in body and mind. Alternatively, hatha and restorative yoga starts at 7.30pm, using traditional yoga practices to help you establish a strong, supple body and a calm, peaceful mindset in preparation for the week ahead.  Both these classes can be modified to suit a variety of fitness levels and beginners are very welcome.
