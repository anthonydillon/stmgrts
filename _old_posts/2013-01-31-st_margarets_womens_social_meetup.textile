* Ladies, recently moved to Richmond, Twickenham, St Margarets?
* Leading a very busy life Monday - Friday, most likely a commuter?
* Returned to London, having lived away for a while? Friends moving on, moving up or moving abroad?

_This is an informal way to meet new female friends aged 30 - 40._

Initially, we're aiming to hook up once a month on the 3<sup>rd</sup> Tuesday of the month at the Turks Head in St Margarets, with a view to meeting more often when the group gets established.

The type of activities we would like to plan include: restaurants, galleries, concerts, historic homes & gardens, horse-riding, movies, museums, opera, sight-seeing, Sunday brunches, talks and lectures, tennis, theatre, walks/rambling, weekend trips & wine tastings!
