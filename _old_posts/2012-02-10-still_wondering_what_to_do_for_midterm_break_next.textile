What about a 5 day filmmaking course where children get the chance to make their own film under instruction from industry professionals?

h4. LAST FEW PLACES LEFT!!

Dreamcatcher Media have been running Summer holiday and mid-term break film camps for several years now in Twickenham, Notting Hill and Elstree. Children learn the basics of film production including scripting, directing, camerawork and sound. They then form a production team to make their own short movie under instruction from professionals and get to play the different production roles including director, sound operator and cameraperson. It's a great learning experience!
