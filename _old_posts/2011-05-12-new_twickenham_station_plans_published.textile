    "Solum":http://www.solumregeneration.co.uk/twickenham.html have withdrawn their planning applications for a 165-unit development and a podium for it to rest on above the platforms. Instead they have submitted a new single bid ("11/1443":https://stmargarets.london/l/Tuqsq) for a 115-unit development plus podium, which was published on May 11, 2011. The usually-mandatory affordable housing has been cut out allowing a 1-floor height reduction.
    
    The piling work for the podium is scheduled for October (there are no rugby internationals this autumn) so Solum are looking for a quick go-ahead for this scheme, either from the Council or from an Inspector on appeal. So if you "wish to comment or object you should do so quickly.":https://stmargarets.london/l/4lTdS

The key document is the Planning Statement, the 6<sup>th</sup> item on the web page. Re Affordable housing, see pp. 11 - 13:

bq. '... no affordable housing . . this approach has been agreed by the council ... confidential financial assessment ...'

It seems clear that this application has been agreed by officers in advance & is expected to sail through. What will residents' group "TRAG-SOS":http://trag-sos.moonfruit.com/ have to say when they see what has been cooked up, I wonder?
