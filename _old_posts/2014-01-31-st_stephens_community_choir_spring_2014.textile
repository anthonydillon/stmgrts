Do you enjoy singing?  Then why not join the St Stephens Community Choir to make some musical magic on Thursday evenings!  Our spring term rehearsals have just begun, and we welcome new singers from all areas of the community and of all abilities - no auditions necessary, just come along and sing!

We are an all-female choir singing a wide range of songs including show tunes, pop, gospel, folk and African songs.  We meet every other Thursday during term-time from 8pm - 9.30pm at St Stephens School hall in Twickenham, just beside the St Margarets roundabout on the Chertsey Road.  We're very informal, and we perform several times a year at local events such as school fairs and Christmas events.

Our adventures have also taken us further afield - last year we took part in a gospel workshop performance at the National Theatre, and we have sung with locally-based 2x2 Opera on many occasions.
