We recently ran a story on the local young person's opera company, the "2x2 Opera":/archives/2006/02/2x2_opera_and_a.html.  Right now they are getting ready for their next performance called "A Very Magical Flute":/cgi-bin/events.cgi?key=200602010748&action=getevent and they really need your help.  According to Deborah Meyer,

If you have a space for them, please email Deborah at "deborah.meyer@meyermusic.co.uk":mailto:deborah.meyer@meyermusic.co.uk.
