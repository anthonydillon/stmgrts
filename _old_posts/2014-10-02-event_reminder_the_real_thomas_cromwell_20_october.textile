_A talk on "20 October 2014 at 7pm":https://stmargarets.london/event/event/200705144662 is followed by a sparkling wine reception_

Born in Putney a lowly tavern keeper's son, and having lived for a time in Mortlake, Cromwell rose swiftly through the ranks to become the king's right-hand man and one of the most powerful figures in Tudor history. 

The architect of England's break with the Roman Catholic Church and the dissolution of the monasteries, he was reviled for years as a Machiavellian schemer who stopped at nothing in his quest for power. But Thomas Cromwell was also a loving husband, father and guardian, a witty and generous host, and a loyal and devoted servant. With new insights into Cromwell's character, his family life and his close relationships with both Cardinal Wolsey and Henry VIII, Tracy Borman examines the life, loves and legacy of the man who changed the shape of England forever.



The talk is by historian Tracy Borman, Joint Chief Curator of Historic Royal Palaces, tells the story of the real Wolf Hall in her definitive biography of Thomas Cromwell, Henry VIII's most trusted servant.
