Residents are invited to pledge to 'waste less' next week as part of a national campaign aimed at reducing environmental impact.

The average family wastes over &pound;700 a year, throwing away food that could otherwise be eaten. Keep Britain Tidy is encouraging everyone to sign up to their 'Waste Less, Live More Challenge' between the 14 - 24 September.

The annual campaign, challenges everyone to rethink how they live their lives, reducing environmental impact, whilst improving the health and happiness of ourselves and each other.

By joining the seven day challenge, you will receive emails each morning with daily tips to help you reduce your food waste.

Cllr Pamela Fleming, Richmond Council Cabinet Member for Environment, said:

bq.  "I am delighted that we are supporting the waste less, live more campaign.  It is the little actions we do in our everyday lives, which we may not realise, that can have a negative effect on our environment.
bq. 
bq. "We want residents to understand that recycling is not just about separating your waste and putting it in the correct bins. We must also look at the ways we can reuse things and reduce the amount of waste we produce in the first place.
bq. 
"This campaign will provide helpful hints and tips during the week that people will hopefully adopt throughout their lives."
