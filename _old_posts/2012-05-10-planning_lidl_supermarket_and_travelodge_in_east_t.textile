Residents of East Twickenham and St Margarets should be aware that a major planning application has been submitted to Richmond Council to redevelop the existing office block and car park on the main Richmond Road Road, behind the bus stop (and beside Old Ryde House) into a Lidl supermarket and a 92 bedroomed Travelodge hotel. This development is much bigger and a storey higher than the existing one, has very limited onsite parking  and would increase traffic and parking pressures in the area.
