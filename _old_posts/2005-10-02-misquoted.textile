I happen to be away this week in New York from my brother's wedding, so I apologise for not having responded sooner.  It appears I have been misquoted in the _Richmond & Twickenham Times_.  

When I spoke to the paper, I told them that I would *not* offer my opinion, but _characterise_ the arguments of both sides as I understood them.

I still haven't read the article, but I take it from a friend that it appeared that I came out in favour of the wine bar.  While I do have an opinion, I have not shared it with the _Richmond & Twickenham Times_ or anyone else.  I will be contacting them to let them know  their error.

Sorry about this, but it was beyond my control.  As we mentioned in our "recent editorial":/archives/2005/09/message_from_th.html we are trying to be unbiased as possible and "provide a means for discussion."
