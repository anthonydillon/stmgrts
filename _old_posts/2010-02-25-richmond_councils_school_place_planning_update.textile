The Richmond Council will send "this leaflet to all parents of school age parents tomorrow [PDF]":/assets/images/2010/StMgts_CETwick_primary_places.pdf outlining the current state of the issues around school places and the two options they are currently considering.

h4. Option 1 Highlights

* *Orleans Infants* remains an infant school but with four-form entry.  Requires building of three classrooms with space reserved for two more.
* *St Stephans* remains as is
* *St Marys Infants* remains as a two form infant School
* *St Marys Junior* moved the St Johns Hospital site and increased to three form entry
* *St Marys Junior site* becomes a one-form entry primary school (Infant & Junior)

_Two additional forms from the current one form expansion_
