_Rock and Roll is alive and kicking!_

The locally based Rock and Roll band, Buddy Flame and The Rockets have had a successful year playing at parties, Jubilee celebrations, fairs and probably the scariest pub in Suffolk and would be delighted to entertain your party or event. 

With a great selection of 50's and early 60's songs in their repertoire audiences have been jiving and bopping to the tunes that started the rock and roll revolution. Have a look a recent video from one of the summer Jubilee parties to see more!
