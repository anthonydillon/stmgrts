An audience were treated to a wonderful concert on Saturday by the St Margarets based quartet The Dolce Divas 4 at All Saints Church, Isleworth. Consisting of two flutes, cello and piano they played a variety of different pieces ranging from Chopin to Edith Piaf. Many of the pieces were arranged for this rather unusual ensemble by cellist Noonie Minogue. Rosie Timpson, one of the flautists, also sang some of the numbers; the  wonderful Speak Low  by Kurt Weill with lyrics by Ogden Nash, Youkali also by Weill with words by Roger Fernay. Rosie has a clear, pure voice which is a pleasure to listen to. Angela Fogg's accomplished piano accompanied some unusual pieces from composers such as Quantz and Doppler. Lilly Dufter-Wimmer, flautist, provided us with some extraordinary and skillful virtuoso performances most notably a spellbinding Chopin variation on a theme by Rossini. Tony Crean read _Fern Hill_ by Dylan Thomas and sang with Rosie the final number, _Fancy Forgetting_ by Sandy Wilson.

Admission was free but there was a collection in aid of St Stephens's school. The heartfelt and enthusiastic applause confirmed that further concerts will be eagerly anticipated.
