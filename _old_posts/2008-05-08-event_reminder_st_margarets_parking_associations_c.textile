By now, village residents and businesses should have recieved their "formal questionnaires from the Council":http://richmond.gov.uk/home/transport_and_streets/motor_vehicles_roads_and_parking/parking/controlled_parking_zones/controlled_parking_zone_consultations/st_margarets_cpz_consultation.htm.

Our association would like the opportunity to counter the council's proposed CPZ and present the reasons why you should be concerned.

We hope to provide more detailed information and address the wider implications in a low key and friendly atmosphere.

All are welcome.

"Meeting is on the 14th May at 7pm in Winchester Hall":https://stmargarets.london/event/meeting/200705141851
