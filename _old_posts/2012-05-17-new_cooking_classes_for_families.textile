Perhaps you didn't cook much before you had children and need some classes to build your confidence?  Or you already like to cook but would appreciate some inspiration to refresh your menu. Maybe you have little time during the week and want to know how to knock out great meals in twenty minutes? Our classes range from the basics of weaning to cooking meals that are suitable for Mums, Dads, teenagers, little ones and babies!

Tuck for Tots are running free introductory classes this summer.  Classes will be tailored to meet individual and / or group needs and will address questions like:

* How to wean your baby (introduction to recipes for purees & baby-led weaning)
* Inspiration for toddler meals
* New ideas for lunch boxes & snacks
* Simple healthy dinners for the whole family

You take home what we cook during the classes giving you a head start to have tasty tuck in the freezer for your next meal-time!

Tuck for Tots is based in St Margarets, but we are happy to come to you and cook in your kitchen.  Do you have a Mum's group / NCT class / Buggyfit class that you'd like to have a cookery lesson with?  We can do day or night time sessions - have a coffee morning or a cheese & wine party with your friends!  Bring your babies along & explore some new cookery inspiration in a fun and easy-going environment.
