In late December, 2005, the High Court allowed for a Group Litigation Order regarding the odour and mosquitoes problems created by the _Mogden Sewage Treatment Works_.  The goal of the group action is to seek compensation and an injunction to prevent Mogden from causing problems in the future.  

Neil Stockdale, at the environment group at Hugh James, was appointed as the lead solicitor.
