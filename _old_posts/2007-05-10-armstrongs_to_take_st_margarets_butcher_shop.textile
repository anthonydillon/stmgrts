According to local, David Bertram:

bq.  "I was in Armstrongs butchers this morning and the proprietor confirmed that they have signed to take the former Frisby shop and hope to open from early August. He said they'd had some run ins with the 'elf-n-safety' goons who had wanted all the old tiles taken down(!) but that they hoped to be able to retain most of the interior as-is.
bq.  
Great news and hope that everyone will support them, though the quality of their products speaks for itself and I don't think they should have too many problems round here."

p. Good news if it happens... now for the bakery....
