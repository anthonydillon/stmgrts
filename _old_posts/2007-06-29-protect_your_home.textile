bq.  "Please will you remind everyone that although our area seems to be relatively crime-free there are still criminals about looking for opportunities for easy pickings. 
bq. 
On the night of June 27<sup>th</sup> a house in Park House Gardens was entered (through a front window that had not been secured) whilst the occupants were asleep -- a particularly frightening experience if you wake up to the thief actually removing stuff from the bedroom in which you are sleeping!  Valuables, a laptop, money and keys were taken and the thief left through the front door. 

So don't be complacent, make sure all your windows and doors are locked securely and keep your keys out of sight. Take all sensible precautions! 

If you need locks or security items do go and see the helpful and friendly staff at Cowley security at 146 Colne Road Twickenham (phone 8894 1212) -- no this is not my shop! I just know them to be a local, long established, and very helpful small business."
