I have a large quantity of used stamps, dating back 20 years, from around the world, to dispose of. The person I used to pass them on to, who collected for Guide Dogs for the Blind, died recently. I should like to find another charity's collector locally who would be interested to take them. If you are interested, or know someone in the Twickenham area who might be, I can deliver them locally.
