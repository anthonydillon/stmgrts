Do you have children who enjoy drama? If so, we are delighted that once again we will be running our Summer Drama Workshop from 19<sup>th</sup> August to the 23<sup>rd</sup> August at Feltham Community College (Drama Studio), Browells Lane, Feltham TW13 7EF.

This drama workshop is open to all children aged 5 to 18 years and will include some singing and movement.

This summer course has been running in Feltham for several years now, and thanks to the generous sponsorship from the London Borough of Hounslow costs just &pound;15.00 for Juniors, ages 5 to 10 and only &pound;20.00 for Seniors, ages 11 to 18. This is the cost for the whole week!!!!

We are trying to reach as many children/young people as we can to take advantage of this fantastic opportunity. The week is very relaxed and we always have lots of fun!

* Juniors - 10.00am to 12.15 - with a performance for family and friends at the end of the week
* Seniors - 1.00pm to 4.00pm - seniors will work on audition pieces, try out a new song, improvisation, drama games and movement.

Improve your confidence and make new friends.
