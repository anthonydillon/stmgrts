After 12 years in Crown Road, we have decided to change the way in which we do business and we will be closing our showroom on 22 Crown Road on Saturday, 10 October.

But after the shop closes, "Peace and Plenty":https://stmargarets.london/directory/home_and_garden/200507150357 will still be trading. For information or to arrange a site visit (local areas), please contact us on 020 8892 5611 or by email at "info@peaceand plenty.co.uk":mailto:info@peaceand plenty.co.uk.
