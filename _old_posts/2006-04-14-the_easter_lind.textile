We just had a call from the manager of "Gift":/directory/home%20and%20garden/200507150408  (2 Crown Road - 0208 891 1115). Apparently they have just had a huge delivery of Lindt Luxury Easter eggs, all are being sold at _40% less_ than Tesco or Superdrug.

Gift wondered if we would like to hold a special draw for those members who have signed up for the newsletter (since we forgot to update the site with a new offer this month), with the lucky reader winning a Lindt Luxury Egg.

The 40% reduction offer is, I am told, also available at "Cutters":/directory/general%20store/200506090425.

So we have had a draw and emailed one reader; hopefully, they will allow us to post their details.
