Humming Bee is a weekly Music and Movement class for preschool children, based on the Kod&#225;ly principles of teaching musicianship. With an emphasis on live music making; we sing, play, listen, and move to music.

Using a wide variety of props - from puppets to percussion - and a vast repertoire of songs and ideas, each session is designed to encourage musical play. Much of the musical learning at this stage is unconscious, as we prepare for the introduction of musical concepts such as pulse, rhythm and pitch. Singing is at the heart of this learning, as it is our very own musical instrument.

The children dance, walk, stamp, and move their bodies; while the smaller children are rocked, held, and take part in multisensory activities including bubbles, floaty materials, and lots more.

The session supports parents and carers to be creative with their children in a fun musical environment.
