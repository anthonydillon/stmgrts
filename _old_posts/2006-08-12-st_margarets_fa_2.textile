Brilliant weather saw record crowds at this year's July 15th Fair on Moormead.  Once again it looks like the Fair has exceeded the previous year's record profits -- all of which go to local schools and designated charities.  This year Moormead itself is also set to benefit, with some of the money going towards the proposed cricket pavilion refurbishment. The Council will match &pound; for &pound; any donation made by the Fair for this project.  A more detailed report in September when the final figures are available.   The Fair Committee will be having an "open meeting":https://stmargarets.london/event/Meeting/200608120546 in Winchester Hall on Monday the 18th of September at 8pm for anyone interested in helping out next year.
