Archaeologists from the Thames Discovery Programme (an organisation which monitors archaeology on the Thames Foreshore) showing off their amazing artefacts. The dates of the artefacts range from half a million years ago to some objects from the present day. The archaeologists will demonstrate how to identify time periods through objects such as clay pipes and they will even bring a human skeleton illustration to help identify bones!

Local historian Dr Pamela Greenwood will be inviting visitors to learn about the fascinating life of Romans. There will be Roman artefacts to explore, costumes to try on, activity sheets and even mystery objects to identify.

The Festival of Archaeology - coordinated by the Council for British Archaeology (CBA) - encourages everyone to explore the archaeology of their local area, watch experts at work, and experience archaeology for themselves. Last year over 1,000 events nationwide, organised by museums, heritage organisations, national and country parks, universities, local societies, and community archaeologists. This year the Festival of Archaeology celebrates its 25<sup>th</sup> year!
