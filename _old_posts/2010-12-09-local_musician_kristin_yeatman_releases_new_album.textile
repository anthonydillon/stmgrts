Born in Montreal, raised in Europe and the maritime provinces of Canada, Kristin Yeatman is releasing her first CD Orleans Road in the UK.

Orleans Road is influenced by musicians ranging from Stevie Wonder to Mcoy Tyner to the Rolling Stones, 70's jazz-funk and southern blues, but the style is clearly unique. With a backdrop of years spent working in a bank plus numerous personal set-backs and adventures, the album paints a story of love, disappointment, heartache and above all humour.  The title, Orleans Road, St Margarets reflects the source of tremendous inspiration, having lived there for two years while working on the album. Kristin says "I could not have found a more perfect setting to take life's problems by the scruff of the neck and write an album of positive music".
