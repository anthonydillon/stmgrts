    We're not just famous for rugby - this Summer, Shakespeare in the Garden is back at the Turk's Head. Permanently Bard presents "Romeo & Juliet" - the greatest love story ever told.

We're not just famous for rugby - this Summer, Shakespeare in the Garden is back at the Turk's Head. Permanently Bard presents "Romeo & Juliet" - the greatest love story ever told.

See a different side to the Turk's Head this Summer, with two magical evenings which will welcome, surprise and delight you. What better place to enjoy Shakespeare's best loved tragedy than with a pint or your favourite glass of wine in our fantastic beer garden. We've been hard at work preparing two amazing menus (will you pick Montague or Capulet?) for you - so book in now for 2 or 3 courses of pre-theatre dinner!
