Mothering Sunday is traditionally the day we show our Mothers that we appreciate them and love them and that we are thankful to have them in our lives.  Mothers Day came to be celebrated in UK in 17<sup>th</sup> century as Mothering Sunday. On this day children give flowers and bouquets to their mother to express their love for them.

England was the first country in the world to dedicate a day for mothers as early as 1600's. Held on the fourth Sunday in the month of Lent, the date for Mother's Day changes each year as the dates of Lent are not fixed.

The tradition came about because families had to send their children into service as domestic servants or apprentices when they were very young. So, once a year the rich families allowed the children to return to their homes and mothers. The idea was that the children would attend the Mother's church, i.e. the church of the family home, rather than the church that was closest to where they were employed. After paying a visit to church, children met their mothers and presented them flowers, which they gathered from bushes along the way. Girls baked special almond cakes called 'Simnel Cakes' or 'Mothering Cakes' for their mothers and the day became a wonderful way to honour  mothers and spend time with the whole family.



h3. Other Mother's Day Facts

* In addition to Mother's Day, _International Women's Day_ is celebrated in many countries on March 8.
* The "_Mother's Day Proclamation_" by Julia Ward Howe was one of the early calls to celebrate Mother's Day in the United States. Written in 1870, Howe's _Mother's Day Proclamation_ was a pacifist reaction to the carnage of the American Civil War and the Franco-Prussian War. The Proclamation was tied to Howe's feminist belief that women had a responsibility to shape their societies at the political level.
* In 1912, Anna Jarvis trademarked the phrases "second Sunday in May" and "Mother's Day", and created the Mother's Day International Association.
She was specific about the location of the apostrophe; it was to be a singular possessive, for each family to honour their mother, not a plural possessive commemorating all mothers in the world. This is also the spelling used by U.S. President Woodrow Wilson in the law making official the holiday in the U.S.
