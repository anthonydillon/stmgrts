    Hampton Wick based charity, Jeevika Trust's youngest ever walker, along with his brother and 30 other walkers have helped the charity to raise over &pound;2000 for water projects in rural India.
    
    Six year old Cameron and his little brother Ryan, four, who attend Orleans Infant School and are from St Margarets, took part in the charity's annual sponsored Walk for Water through Bushy Park and along the Thames towpath on Sunday 25<sup>th</sup> September along with other friends and supporters of the charity.  Ryan was picked up by his dad half way round the 6 mile route after doing a sterling job, but Cameron had so much energy at the end, he ran home!  Liz, the charitable boys' mum said 'The boys and I had a great time doing it together.  Ryan did a super job to get as far as Ham House, and Cameron felt so wonderful at the end, that after our bus ride to Twickenham, he ran the last half mile home.  I am so proud of them - the sponsorship is still coming in and it looks like they have managed to raise well over &pound;100.'

Hampton Wick based charity, Jeevika Trust's youngest ever walker, along with his brother and 30 other walkers have helped the charity to raise over &pound;2000 for water projects in rural India.

Six year old Cameron and his little brother Ryan, four, who attend Orleans Infant School and are from St Margarets, took part in the charity's annual sponsored Walk for Water through Bushy Park and along the Thames towpath on Sunday 25<sup>th</sup> September along with other friends and supporters of the charity.

Jeevika Trust's Director, Andrew Redpath said:  

bq. "Support from people like Cameron and Ryan and their fellow walkers means an awful lot to the charity and is vital to make sure our work reaches the people who really need it.  Since Jeevika Trust relies entirely on voluntary donations to raise the minimum of &pound;100,000 we need each year to keep our projects on the road, every penny really does make a difference!  Over the last 5 years our 'Walk for Water' has raised over &pound;17,000 to support our water projects and make a difference to many thousands of lives in rural India.  Every day many Indian women have to walk up to 6 miles to collect water for the family - by joining Jeevika Trust's 'Walk for Water' our walkers shared their experience for just one day."
