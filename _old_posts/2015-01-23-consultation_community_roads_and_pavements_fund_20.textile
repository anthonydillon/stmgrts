In the All in One survey, residents highlighted the condition of roads and pavements among their top concerns. In response, the Council aims to make available &pound;490,000 to pay specifically for community nominated improvements.

The fourth round of funding is now open for residents to nominate more roads and pavements they feel are in need of extra work. This is in addition to the regular maintenance work being carried out.



In the last round of nominations in early 2014, over 1,900 people took part and many neighbours joined forces to suggest repairs to their local area. Each village receives &pound;35,000 and local residents choose where this should be spent. The money may be spilt up to address a number of issues within each village.

_The closing date for nominations is 22 February 2015._
