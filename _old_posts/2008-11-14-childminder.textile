My name is Janell and I am a new childminder in St Margarets, I live near the roundabout and I have now started my own childminding business and I want to offer mums in the area the best childcare possible! All parents receive:

* Development Profiles for their child, including photos, handprints, artwork, development updates etc...
* Daily record books, what your child has eaten, how they have slept and what they have enjoyed each day.
* An experienced registered local childminder who is working on their diploma in home based teaching and who thinks children deserve the best!

All children receive:

* Nutritious meals and snacks
* Fun age appropriate activities
* Themed art activities
* Music and art daily (if they want of course)
... and lots of love and attention

My hours are 8am to 6pm and I have spaces available now for January 2009 but they are going fast.
