Here is a little more about the soldier who drove the bulldozer at Bergen-Belsen concentration camp at the time of its liberation - April 15<sup>th</sup> 1945.  His name was Frank Chapman 14322433.  He was 21 years old and a Sapper in the Royal Engineers, 619 Field Park Company.

An article in 'The Times' of April 16<sup>th</sup> 2005 marking the 60<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the liberation of the camp noted...

bq. "Frank Chapman, who drove the bulldozer that piled the naked corpses into communal graves, remained scarred by his camp experience until his death 18 months ago."

Buried in one of those communal graves are the bodies of 15 year old Anne Frank and her 19 year old sister Margot.
