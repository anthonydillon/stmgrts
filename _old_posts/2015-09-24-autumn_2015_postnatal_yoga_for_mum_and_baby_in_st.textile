Postnatal yoga is a perfect way to gently heal and recover body and mind after the birth of your baby. Yoga postures are used to regain strength and muscle tone, with a specific focus on the pelvic floor and back. Gentle breathing and relaxation techniques encourage stillness and calm to rejuvenate, relax and regain strength from within.

Classes incorporate mum and baby, (so no need for a babysitter), and are a wonderful opportunity to meet other local new mums.
