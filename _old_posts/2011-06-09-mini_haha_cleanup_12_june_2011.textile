The Thames Angler's Conservancy are organising a litter pick and clean-up of the "Mini Ha-Ha" on <a href="/assets/images/2011/Mini-HaHa-Cleanup.gif" title="See larger version of - poster">Sunday, 12th June at 8.30am</a>. This will be similar to the one we did recently on the River Crane. Gloves, litter-pickers and bin-bags will be provided, just put on some old clothes and bring yourselves along.

The Mini Ha-Ha is a flood drainage ditch which runs alongside the Thames from Richmond railway bridge downstream as far as Kew Gardens. During high spring tides the river floods the Old Deer Park, the water drains away again via this channel. It is also a haven for wildlife and a spawning ground for fish.

_Updated: 8.30, not 8.00!_
