The meeting at York House, organised by TRAG, was attended by more than 200 local residents and councillors.  TRAG presented two alternate plans for Twickenham Station redevelopment.  Both plans are much smaller in scale than the proposed Solum plans.

You can look at these plans, known as <a href="http://trag-sos.moonfruit.com/#/plan-b1/4556583608">Plan B1</a> and <a href="http://trag-sos.moonfruit.com/#/plan-b2/4556544947">Plan B2</a> and let us know what you think.
