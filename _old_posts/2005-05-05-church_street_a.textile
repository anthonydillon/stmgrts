From 2 June to 4 September 2005 _al fresco_ dining has returned to "Church Street":http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=church+street,+tw1&spn=0.027466,0.058375&hl=en in Twickenham.  If you haven't been, they shut-down the entire street to traffic and diners can eat on the brick street.

There are six restaurants and two pubs are participating.

The hours are every Thursday, Friday and Saturday evening from 6-11pm and Sundays from 10:30am - 8pm.

For more information, look at their "website":http://www.twickenhamchurchstreet.org/.
