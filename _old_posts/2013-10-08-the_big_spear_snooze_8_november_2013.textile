SPEAR is a local charity providing support for people who are homeless. We help people move off the streets and address the issues that may have led to their homelessness so they can start living a much better life.

Our flagship event is The Big SPEAR Snooze where the community takes part in a sponsored sleepout to raise funds and awareness for our work. This year the sleepout is happening on Friday 8 November at St Mary's Community Hall / Church in Twickenham.

We are looking for people who would be willing to sleep outside for just one night to help those living without a home.

There is supper and entertainment provided beforehand, and breakfast in the morning. Although it's a challenging event, we promise it's also very memorable and an experience you will never forget.
