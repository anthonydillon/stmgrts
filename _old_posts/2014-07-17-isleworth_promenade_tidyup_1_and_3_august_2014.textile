    On the 1 and 3 August 2014, a team lead by the "Thames Landscape Strategy":http://thames-landscape-strategy.org.uk/ and "SWLEN":http://www.swlen.org.uk/ will be cutting back some of the plants that have encroached on the path and reducing the view of the river. Conserving the biodiversity is of high concern though, so don't worry about losing important beasties and flora!

They would like a few volunteers to help on the days, and to ask if there is any local interest in setting up a 'Friends of Isleworth Promenade' type group.
