Twenty-eight residents from around the borough were honoured on the 21 September 2013 at an event to celebrate Richmond Council's Community Awards.

Over the four week nomination period nearly 150 nominations were received. An officer panel chaired by the Cabinet Member for Communities, Business and Culture, reviewed each nomination and selected a final 28 to be presented with an award.

The winners were nominated for a wide range of activities, ranging from those who have established and managed community groups, those who organise community events, residents who have volunteered or raise money for charity and those who help support the most vulnerable in society.

Simon won as he has dedicated enormous time and effort to the development of St Margaret's as a thriving business community.

_Well done and thank you Simon_
