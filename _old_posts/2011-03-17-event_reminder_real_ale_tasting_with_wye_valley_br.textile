This month we're pleased to have ventured a little further afield, and have teamed up with Hereford based, Wye Valley Brewery.  Founded in 1985 by ex-Guinness brewer, Peter Amor, we will be joined by Peter's son Vernon, who trained at Youngs Brewery in Wandsworth.  They source their ingredients locally, wherever possible, with their determination to constantly improve meaning they have attracted many awards.

Recently they were lucky enough to win the Best Drinks Producer 2010 .The judges were impressed by their commitment to selecting local Herefordshire hops, and dedication to quality through traditional production methods. In particular, they praised the 'morishness' of their beers!

They received their award from Oz Clarke, and have since featured in two editions of the BBC Radio 4 Food Programme about the competition.

We will be sampling their great range of different beers - from their Dorothy Goodbody bottled range to their seasonal cask, all available on the evening. Vernon will talk us through each of the beers as well as giving an interesting insight in to the brewery history and brewing process.
