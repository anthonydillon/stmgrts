From the official record: 

bq. "On 20<sup>th</sup> May the Council's Transport Consultative Group which consists of members of both political parties and lay experts advised the Cabinet Member for Transport and Parking to make a decision to include Moor Mead and Sidney Roads and Cole Park View in a further extension of the St Margarets South CPZ. However the Group also advised the Cabinet Member to give consideration to the inclusion of Kenley and Godstone Roads in the Traffic Management Order to afford their residents the opportunity to reconsider their position in the light of this further extension. Therefore whilst advertisement of the Traffic Order will include those roads the Council in accordance with its policy and supported by your councillors will only implement controlled parking in them if there is a majority in favour."

The ward councillors will send a street letter to Godstone and Kenley to clarify and dispel doubts.
