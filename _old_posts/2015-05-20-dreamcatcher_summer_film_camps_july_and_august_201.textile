Here at Dreamcatcher Media, the films made on our Summer Film Camps feature great heroes and anti-heroes, goodies and baddies, exciting chases and dramatic scenes - all scripted, filmed and directed by young people aged 8 - 18.



Our summer 5 day Film Camp starts on 13<sup>th</sup> July. Children come up with their own idea for a film, and then set about shooting, directing and editing it over the five days under expert tuition from industry professionals. It's all great fun but good learning too and young wannabee filmmakers finish the course equipped to make their own movies.

Sponsored by the Alpha Plus Group, the Camp takes place at Falcons Boys Prep School in Richmond and runs for 5 weeks from July 7<sup>th</sup> until August 22<sup>nd</sup> starting at 9am. The dates are as follows -

* July 13<sup>th</sup> To July 17th
* July 20<sup>th</sup> To July 24th
* July 27<sup>th</sup> to July 31st
* August 3<sup>rd</sup> To August 7th
* August 10<sup>th</sup> To August 14th
* August 17<sup>th</sup> to August 21st
