Vince Cable, following his election as the MP for Twickenham, has committed to serving each and every Twickenham resident.

Speaking a few hours after the count Vince Cable MP said:

bq.  "It is great to be back serving the people of Twickenham.  It is a privilege to serve a constituency so special as Twickenham.
bq. 
bq. "During the campaign I have been overwhelmed by the great reception I and my team have received in Twickenham.
bq. 
bq. "I pledge to serve each and every Twickenham resident to the best of my abilities. My number one priority is to be a good constituency MP.
bq. 
bq. "I am keen that the views of all people living in the constituency are heard at Westminster.  If there is one message that has come out from the General Election result nationally it is that too many young feel they been marginalised and not properly listened to.  It is time that changed."
bq.
